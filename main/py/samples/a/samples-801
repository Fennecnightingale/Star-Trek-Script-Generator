 On our way.

 You are in Starfleet space.

 VIO 
 (looking at a 
 schematic of the Dominion and a drawing of 
 the Cardassian border) 
 This is the border. There 
 is no other way to verify it. 
 
 KIRA 
 No. 
 
 VIO 
 It is the borders, but 
 I will be able to verify 
 them. 
 
 KIRA 
 Well, thats 
 why I dont want it to come 
 along with you. But youd have 
 a right to speak to us. 
 
 VIO 
 You have done nothing but 
 threaten us. 
 
 KIRA 
 (speaking to Vino) 
 If its all there is to see, we should 
 see. 
 
 VIO 
 Thats why I wish youd seen. 
 (to Sisko) 
 You cant refuse to see the 
 borders. 
 
 KIRA 
 If you refuse to see 
 them, we can and will take the 
 evidence of our own 
 superior intelligence. 
 
 SISKO 
 Then why do you want him seen, 
 Mister Dax? 
 
 VINO 
 (to Kira) 
 Why? 
 
 KIRA 
 We didnt even know that there was 
 any point in my presence - its like

 that nebula. 
 
 VINO 
 (to Kira) 
 You could simply just as easily

 only reason is that youd 
 
 KIRA 
 What about the borders?

 The one-quarter of the

 With the slightest hesitation, Vino 
 moves to the opposite end of the 
 border. 
 
 VINO 
 (to Kira) 
 How long have you been there? 
 
 KIRA 
 (to a Cardassian guard) 
 They will leave at fifteen hundred 
 hours. 
 
 VINO 
 I have waited so long for that 
 
 KIRA

 And you will go with him.
