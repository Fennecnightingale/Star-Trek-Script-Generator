 We need to know more about the weapon its deployed in that location. 
 Do we have the co-ordinates for the weapon? 
 
 BOSS 
 I wish we had more information by now. 
 (beat) 
 but we have to keep these 
 
 PICARD 
 I appreciate your efforts. But 
 your presence in this 
 discussion is vital - if your 
 father is alive he is carrying me 
 back. You have my word that your 
 sons will be returned. 
 
 BOSS 
 You do seem surprised, Captain. 
 
 PICARD 
 (grimly) 
 If the Council is meeting 
 
 BOSS 
 Not if I live to assure you of 
 your safety. 
 
 He turns off the monitor and suddenly a wave of 
 Hormic fire rips through the rock pills over 
 the hillside to reveal - 
 
9 NEW ANGLE 
 as a line of light appears in the rock caverns 
 into the rock and it forms a sort of hand 
 sign into the rock itself. As a result 
 of this, a large quantity of phaser burns down 
 into the rock and crackles its way through the 
 rock into the hole. Kirk and Spock instantly move 
 the arm. Both are startled but 
 both are amazed at what they have been done. 
 
 FADE OUT.

8 INTERIOR OPS - QUARE - THE TUMBLING ROOM 
 
 Worf is piloting General Loomis ship. 
 
 PICARD, sitting in the same chair where Loomis 
 a Lieutenant with his cap, is having an 
 impact on the console. 
 
 WORF 
 Sir, I am checking Loomis home. 
 I cannot find anything unusual. 
 
 PICARD 
 What? 
 
 WORF 
 I have never been in a positronic 
 match. 
 
 PICARD 
 You have never sounded in the 
 mood. 
 
 Worf reacts, then suddenly frustrated - 
 
 WORF 
 It is a waste of time to use the 
 Ppah-wraithium-energy matrix for 
 everything he wants to do for 
 this station. I will not have 
 his - and neither need nor time to.

 PICARD 
 Then I suppose it will just have to 
 be lucky. 
 
 His own self becomes a little more consumed by the 
 Ppah-wraithium that is already sitting nearby. 
 He pauses for a moment then steps right 
 in front, and studies the face before 
 his eyes. 
 
 WORF 
 Captain Picard, I am sorry for you. 
 But I could use your help. 
 
 PICARD 
 That is not needed. 
 
 WORF 
 Perhaps you will stay out of the post of 
 military policy for the time. 
 
 PICARD 
 The future will be my same as 
 yesterday. I have no hope of 
 maintaining a communications link with 
 Commander Loomis people. If 
 I try to leave my hopes of survival I 
 have my own beginning day. 
 
 WORF 
 I have been working for one hundred years 
 in the hope you will understand.

 PICARD 
 You will have to look at my family 
 to gain my respect. 
 
 Worf begins to walk away, then turns back and 
 stares at Picard in surprise. He begins to 
 walk. 
 
 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 I hope to do this as my only 
 concern is for your well- 
 rested health. 
 
 WORF 
 Your health is of no 
 consequence to my duties 
 on the Enterprise, Captain.
