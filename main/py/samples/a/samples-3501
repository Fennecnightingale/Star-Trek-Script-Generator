 I will need help in repairing some 
 of these cranial damage to the 
 surface. Its been years 
 past. Its time was lost so the 
 treatment wont work. 
 
 TROI 
 What are you talking about? They say that 
 every head has its scars. 
 
 She covers her head lightly as her hair as she 
 takes a tumble, she covers her head as she gets up 
 against the bulkhead. She cant sleep. She 
 sits on the floor of one of the 
 cylindrical beds. Beverly and Troi look at her and 
 Beverly wonders about something but doesnt want to talk about it. Troi looks back with 
 Beverly there and is amazed to get a moment with her. Then

 Isolation from the rest of the skull 
 will suffice. 
 
 Beverly looks at Beverly and suddenly a BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT Fills the 
 RACK. She sees that the RACK is open again and the body 
 is still there. On their expressions

 Picard and the others are gathered outside an airlock. As 
 the airlock begins to pass it, the ship 
 shakes slightly. 
 
15 INTERIOR WARDROOM 
 
 Picard is standing outside the airlock corridor, trying to stop the 
 Transporter to his right. The airlock SOUNDS 
 with the SHAKING SOUND of a PAIR OF BLOCK LATER. Picard 
 turns down it the rest of the way. He notices a CREWPERSON sitting 
 against the wall. He gives it a wide berth, then 
 disappears as the airlock. Troi and Troi look 
 around, seeing the empty barrel and the like-eyed monster 
 is still there.

 Troi is stunned by a sense of panic from the 
 away team. They stop what they are doing 
 in panic.

 She turns around and sees that the away 
 team has some otherworldly 
 images of devastation. They are gone. 
 
 The away team cautiously descends the corridor until 
 the airlock completely clears.
