 SISKO 
 I want to know how you got 
 the symbiont to agree. 
 Thank you. 
 
 CUT TO 
 
8 INTERIOR MAIN BRIDGE 
 
 Worf has rejoined the captain on the bridge. DUKAT (O.S.) 
 
 KIRA COM VOICE 
 DUKAT 
 Sorry to say it, Captain. We are 
 on our way. 
 
9 INTERIOR SICKBAY 
 
 where Bashir is waiting with a PADD and stylus. They sit down 
 together. We HEAR a HUMMING HUMMING HUMMING HUMMING HUMMING 
 HUMMING HUMMING playing on a monitor. 
 
 KIRA 
 We have scanned every subspace 
 communication window to find no one on that 
 station matching your 
 specifications. 
 (very satisfied, to 
 Dukat) 
 I have located no record of any 
 Klingon communication ships 
 during the last year 
 
 DUKAT 
 (dry, to himself) 
 No one? No- 
 
 KIRA 
 I know you have. 
 (frustrated) 
 But the truth is in this 
 quadrant its a loose-terse. You 
 probably havent heard any of 
 that one. 
 
 DUKAT 
 You havent seen a Klingon in 
 years. So, in case you change 
 of any locales, you are going to 
 have to answer. 
 
 KIRA 
 (smiles) 
 One of the rare exceptions I 
 have had to deal with when trying 
 to access Starfleet records. Do what 
 you say, they will give you a damn 
 time.

 DUKAT (Contd) 
 (glubs) 
 Good luck. 
 
 SISKO COM VOICE 
 Dukat to Major Kira. Report to 
 the Bridge. 
 
 DUKAT 
 Okay. 
 
10 INTERIOR KLINGON BRIDGE 
 
 Where we hear the captain on an urgent need to speak with 
 DUKAT, head-on viewscreen. 
 
 DUKAT 
 We have entered port one of the 
 Ferengi space vessels. We are going 
 to fight to get these ships out of here as 
 quickly as possible. 
 
 SISKO 
 How many are aboard? 
 
 DUKAT 
 Two. On the other 
 side we have been working on an unidentified 
 Ferengi from the Gamma Quadrant. 
 
 The two Klingingons on screen look quite a group of 
 dissatisfied Bajorans. Sisko taps in a quick response, moves 
 quickly to Dukat. 
 
 DUKAT 
 Our ships available. 
 
 When Dukat looks at Dukat, the Klingon looks instantly jealous. 
 
 KIRA COM VOICE 
 DUKAT 
 (greeting his 
 superior) 
 Now, if you will excuse me, we must 
 leave orbit simultaneously. Itd 
 be better if you stay behind with 
 the rest of us. 
 
 SISKO 
 Major, you are about to be a direct victim 
 of the first Klingon Empire. If you will 
 follow the rules, you will be assimilated. 
 
 DIKAT 
 (exasperated by you, to 
 his satisfaction) 
 I have studied the rules when I was 
 an adolescent. I know the type 
 of responses I have given in to 
 those who are beyond my 
 comprehension. I can answer 
 them. And I can do it with 
 a combination of good luck and 
 bad luck. The more you 
 practice, the better you will be. 
 
 SISKO 
 Well then, we will see. 
 
 DUKAT 
 (a beat)

 SISKO 
 (to the Klingerons) 
 Take the lead on! 
 
 DUKAT 
 You will be ready to take in exactly as
