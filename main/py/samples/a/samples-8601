 Me. He needs a 
romantic approach. 
JANEWAY Its too bad. His approach is too precipitated. 
RUTH I just havent had much contact with resistance 
members. Theres never been resistance from 
them. 
JANEWAY Resistance members? 
RUTH I dont believe them are dying. Some of them are 
protesting. 
JANEWAY Criticism? 
RUTH I have taken dozens of approaches. From the resistance 
movement, we have evolved past them. 
JANEWAY A cloaking device. 
RUTH A device that enhances navigation. I have never seen 
anything like it. 
JANEWAY We are familiar. 
RUTH The resistance movement is vocal. But, to my ears, I 
dont need words to describe how well resistance 
is. 
JANEWAY Mmm. Well, in that case, enjoy your quarters. Yes, 
its perfect. You just earned a taste for Trekan cuisine. 
RUTH As my chef, Im fond of the hapless but elegant 
German cuisine. 
JANEWAY Oh, one spoonful. May I suggest a glass? 
RUTH I couldnt get you a real glass from Starfleet Command. 
Trying to get the flavors we pick up along with the 
drinks. 
JANEWAY What? 
RUTH A flapsal fruit salad. 
JANEWAY Why? 
RUTH I learned from my son. A friend. 
JANEWAY Oh, Ransom. 
RANEL All right. Come to the table. Im going to make a toast. 
JANEWAY Mm. Wow. 
RANSOM You know, you are quite an aficionado on international ships. 
JANEWAY Some of our best chefs have names, dont we? 
RANSOM Have you heard of the resistance movement known as the 
Titanium Projectors, or the holograms that were created by the 
Counter Resistance network? 
JANEWAY We wanted all of them to come together into our program. 
RANSOM Show us. 
JANEWAY This is Resistance Landon. 
RANSOM Forgive me, my friends. I have been trying to get back to work on a 
projection, but its been a few months. 
JANEWAY Oh, you have made a mark on my progress. 
RANSOM Today, yesterday and everything here. Until yesterday, in fact. 
JANEWAY Oh, see. 
RANSOM As you can see, we have defeated the opposition to 
categorise the battle, but with a new type of allies we may be 
losing. 
JANEWAY They werent willing to let us use the term neutrinos. 
RANSOM The Nemesis must have created quite a diverse 
variety of counterinsurgents. 
JANEWAY Counterinsurgents? 
RANSOM Reconstruction programmes. Our goal is to armament our attack with 
against a completely new enemy. 
TUVOK May I ask under which command the admiral 
resigned? 
RANSOM When the war began I knew we had our own salvation, my friend. 
KIM The one and only Boothby was a Starfleet officer. 
RANSOM I think he served under the Regent and Paris together for a quite 
long time. 
TUVOK Still, it is prudent to assume the end of the conflict. 
RANSOM You have no idea what we are talking about. All we know 
 is if the war doesnt end soon, the Dominion 
will step aside to accept our help and we will send a message home. 
JANEWAY Im worried about the consequences. We are still reeling by the 
contamination. 
RANSOM End of the conflict? When the United Federation 
procedes too much involved, the old Cold War is over, and Starfleet 
Command will begin to prepare its fleet for the operation. 
JANEWAY We will end the war in eight hours. I want to speak to the 
Cardassian Central Command, explain our position at the ready. 
RANSOM Thats an excellent plan, Captain. 
JANEWAY And my proposal. Ready to beam our troops directly to 
Borgas. 
RANSOM You can make it clear. We will not have needed expensive entanglements in 
Borg space. 
JANEWAY We will transport directly to Draconis for a study. You will 
find
