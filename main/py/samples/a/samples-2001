 JIRA 
 (sardonic) 
 Yes, maam, this is good news. The first 
 things, we have got the beginnings of 
 a great opportunity. 
 
 Dukat sits. Dukat is a man of honor and he comes out 
 with a face that says, "I know this is going 
 to be difficult but

 DAUKAT 
 Then you have to get out of 
 the way. 
 
 Dukat nods, leaving a surprised Dukat to 
 contemplate the decision. 
 
21 INTERIOR DUKAT QUARTERS - BRIDGE 
 
 As before. We hear the ENGINEERING noise as Sisko 
 moves to the Commanders chair. 
 
 SISKO 
 Chief? Whats the report? 
 
 Sisko turns to Sisko. 
 
 SISKO 
 No one in Dukat was 
 reported killed in the last fifteen years 
 
 Sisko stands in surprise. 
 
 SISKO 
 As the report suggests, the Dominion 
 did take advantage of this situation 
 
 Sisko considers this, then back to the chair. 
 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Bashir, Part I" - REV. 4/14/95 - ACT ONE 9A.

 SISKO 
 (gently) 
 Your report this morning 
 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Bashir, Part I" - REV. 4/14/95 - ACT ONE 9A. 
 
21 CONTINUED (2) 
 
 Sisko sits back in his chair. 
 
 SISKO 
 (reacts) 
 Yes. Im happy the Dukat is still 
 alive. 
 
 Sisko goes to him, as always, a man of honor and he 
 smiles. 
 
 SISKO 
 If they are still alive, 
 the Dominion can be very 
 dangerous. 
 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Bashir, Part II" - REV. 4/14/95 - ACT ONE 10. 
 
 
21 CONTINUED (3) 
 
 Sisko is very pleased to hear this. 
 
 SISKO 
 The Dukat gave a personal 
 appraisal this morning. 
 I asked him if he 
 believed that my actions 
 were the most prudent in the 
 Dukat tradition. 
 
 Sisko turns to him, pleased with himself. 
 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Bashir, Part I" - REV. 4/14/95 - ACT ONE 11. 
 
21 CONTINUED (3) 
 
 SISKO 
 He also told me of the 
 importance of the station remaining operational right here. 
 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Bashir, Part II" - REV. 4/14/95 - ACT ONE 12.

 SISKO 
 A good ship would be 
 damaged, but the 
 Federation would be 
 able to maintain the 
 station but it would have to face 
 the threat of Dominion attack, 
 so I would make my position clear. 
 
 A beat as Sisko considers his words. He 
 considers his next words carefully. After a long 
 moment, he smiles. 
 
 SISKO 
 (to Sisko) 
 May I see Lieutenant Dax? 
 
 Dax gives him a curious smile. 
 
 DUKAT 
 (smooth) 
 May I see your sister? 
 
 CUT TO 
 
24 INTERIOR SHIP INTAIL 
 
 A small, two-sided starboard of the station. 
 BASHIR 
 Julian to Sisko. 
 
 
 Sisko takes a step toward Bashir. 
 
 SISKO 
 (continuing) 
 The last time I left, it 
 seemed like every day I would 
 be home again. 
 
 He nods, looks away, unsure what to expect.
