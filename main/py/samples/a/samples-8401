, but some of those questions 
 are too far answered. 
 
 KIRA 
 Then I will start.

 OBRIEN 
 Major, if you wont mind, Id like to talk to you in my 
 Ready Room. 
 
 KIRA 
 (quickly) 
 Not at all. 
 
 OBrien looks to her, puzzled. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Tell her, Keiko will be joining us, once 
 aboard. 
 
 Keiko and OBrien exchange an apprehensive glance. 
 
 MRS. CARMICHAEL VOICE 
 How long, Miles?

 KIRA 
 Its a complicated procedure, Mrs. 
 OBriens. 
 
 MRS. KELIE VOICE 
 Let me take it easy. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 How do you mean, "not simple" 
 
 KIRA 
 Oh, no. Thats the one thing she said when 
 she said she was joining. The instructions were for 
 her program, not to mention the health 
 ramifications. 
 
 SISKO 
 Id like to do something. 
 
 KIRA 
 You are in there. You will be working 
 with her. 
 
 SISKO 
 How do this work? 
 
 KIRA 
 There are three steps. The first 
 one involves the immunorems. 
 The second involves the RNA sequence 
 markers found in the transceiver array - 
 
 SISKO 
 Transmitted to Starfleet and 
 the Dominion. 
 
 KIRA 
 (nods) 
 The three steps are almost simultaneous. 
 Which causes the problem? 
 
 SISKO 
 (firm) 
 Now all you know is that to the point 
 at which point the virus is 
 going to begin. 
 
 She takes his hands in a gesture. 
 
 MRS. KELIE 
 Are you ready? 
 (mildly) 
 When do we move out of phase? 
 
 The doors now OPEN and she turns to OBrien, 
 looking at him questioningly. 
 
 MRS. KELIE 
 We cant just cut out 
 (clears throat) 
 It will take five hours to work out 
 this virus and we will 
 be fully prepared in a few moments. 
 
 OBrien doesnt have anything. He nods, and we 
 
 GO TO

6 INTERIOR U.S. KELIE HOME SHIM - DAY 
 
 The Kelie is not entirely convinced shes 
 going to live with her long-term memories. 
 
 KIRA 
 Are you sure its not a problem 
 now? 
 
 KAELIE 
 There is a house built into the 
 walls a power conduit 
 
 KIRA 
 Something? 
 
 KAELIE 
 (firm) 
 No its nothing. 
 
 KIRA 
 (I think she means 
) 
 No power coils, no life 
 
 KAELIE 
 (defirm) 
 Everything from, like, this 
 station? This is a lifeline 
 for the Gamma quadrant. 
 
 SISKO 
 (firmly) 
 This room was built for 
 Starfleet over 80 years. 
 I have no doubt there are 
 survivors there. 
 
 KAELIE 
 (firm) 
 Yes. Thats what we have been 
 told.

 KIRA 
 So, she could have been at 
 Starbase 10 where she 
 could hear the stories of 
 her people. 
 (a beat) 
 And then there it was. 
 
 KAELIE 
 (voice rising over 
 sound of 
 hyperbole) 
 Oh you will never find the
