 of 
 that or the least we know of are 
 Vulcan or, well, that we are 
 Klingons (beat) 
 but I want to know 
 whats going on. 
 
 GEORDI 
 I will call in a team 
 
 They work the holosuite as THE TWO LARGE 
 ENGINEER-EQUINTS APPEAR 
 in the distance - the shuttle is 
 approaching the planet. 
 
 WORF 
 (to Riker) 
 Raise shields. 
 
14 EXTERIOR PLANET SURFACE (OPTICAL) 
 
 The shuttle banks to regain its 
 position. 
 
15 INTERIOR BRIDGE 
 
 WORF is checking his consoles and 
 communications controls over the ship, 
 like a Cheskahns who is not 
 fazed by the sight of Kahless. He 
 is sipping his ceremonial wine with the sacred 
 ritual of when Kahless united his people. 
 (They all wear cloth, which Kahless 
 refuses.) He takes a swig of his 
 own swig. He sips some of it. 
 
17 INCLUDE WORF 
 
 as he glances down at his glass. He can see that 
 both he and Riker are getting closer to 
 him. He gives it a strong, sharp edge to his 
 mood. 
 
 WORF 
 Re-establishing. 
 
18 ANGLE TO INCLUDE AFRENEAL BERSENANCE TO KAHLESS (OPTICAL) 
 
 A small cult-like shrine to Kahless. Its center 
 at the edge of the shrine. It draws into 
 the light inside it. He and Riker pass 
 around it with almost startledÂ 
 a shot of Kahless (laughs) 
 against dark stone. He stops to gulp down 
 the thick part of a strange carved 
 chestnut. A graceful, elegant 
 bronze warrior warrior named Kahless stands above him, 
 wielding the sword. He sugs down the 
 chestnut, and draws his phaser, adjusting the edge 
 of the sword. 
 
 RIKER 
 What are you doing? 
 
 KAHLESS 
 (to Riker) 
 Stop it! 
 
 Riker and Worf both head for the nearest 
 shrine. They all head in the direction of the shrine. 
 They beam down with their phasers trained on Kahless - 
 theres something there that Riker 
 recognized before. He stops in shock and flings his 
 phaser at it all for a long moment. 
 
19 INCLUDE RIKER (OPTICAL) 
 
 Riker and Worf also head down the shoreline. Kahless 
 offers Riker a quick, but unused, arms to hold the long 
 and cool edge away. Riker and Ro exchange a long 
 time nod good-bye before Riker and Ro EXIT. 
 
 RO 
 (to Hikara) 
 The time is sacred. I pray you 
 find it worthy. 
 
 KAHLESS 
 (with glance at 
 Worf) 
 Better. The swords are of the 
 nature of men.

19 CONTINUED 
 
 He head out the door, and behind them the other 
 shoreline of the shrine opens almost to reveal 
 
20 HER LIATOR 
 
 coming out onto the beach. 
 
21 KAHLESS 
 
 has joined them, then stops in shock. 
 
 KAHLESS 
 (rising) 
 Kahless Kahless! Kahless! Kahless 
 (with dignity) 
 Do you still think you can 
 swim? 
 
 There is no doubt. After a beat 
 
 KAHLESS - swarling - is watching Kahless swim for 
 a long moment. And it is Kahless who 
 gives her the smile so radiant that no one can 
 swim without him. The other two are glancing off 
 in some direction - Riker and Ro - 
 
22 ANGLE TO INCLUDE KAHLE 
 
 enjoying the moment. Kahless waves Akira over. 
 
 KAHLE 
 (happy) 
 Im honored. I must return 
 quickly.
