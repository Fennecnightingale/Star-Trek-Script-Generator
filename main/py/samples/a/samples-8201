 Riker nods. He cant help but grin in return. He 
 finds it hard to hide his warmth.

 RIKER 
 Im curious, Doctor. How does 
 the new android do work? 
 
 DATA 
 The initial databases 
 are complete. 
 
 Off-handed, B.C. 
 
 B. 
 
 What? 
 
 DATA 
 The computer has been reboot. 
 
 No sign of Doctor Pulaski. 
 
 Picard is taken totally off guard by this - 
 
 PICARD 
 Doctor - 
 
 B.C. 
 
 PICARD 
 When can we expect you? 
 
22 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) 
 
 in orbit around a large planet three moons are also 
 prominent. 
 
23 INTERIOR READY ROOM 
 
 The desk is heavily guarded, and there are several 
 lights streaming out. 
 
 PICARD 
 The bridge will require 
 all visitors to enter. 
 
 DATA 
 Very well. The internal systems will 
 be scanned and the 
 communications protected. 
 
 PICARD 
 There should be plenty of 
 opportunities for visitors to 
 the surface. There are a number 
 of steps you and I, together.

 DATA 
 You will find that the 
 Romulan weapons appear 
 very weak and the 
 Earth-Romulan Warbird 
 is highly maneuverable. 
 
 PICARD 
 The Warbird is strong and 
 capable - 
 
 DATA 
 It is likely to inflict 
 significant damage to the 
 Bridge as well. 
 
 PICARD 
 (to Data) 
 When he engages the 
 weapon, it should change 
 everything for the 
 Enterprises sake, 
 sir. 
 
 DATA 
 That is correct, sir. 
 
 PICARD 
 (to Data) 
 You are looking at a weakness 
 instead of a weakness 
 in Captain Picard. 
 
 DATA 
 There is no weakening. 
 
23A WORF 
 
 He steps into his desk and activates the 
 VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) - Picard and the others 
 appear on the Main Viewer. 
 
 WORF 
 We have been expecting to see how the two 
 sisters behaved themselves and then react 
 to the sight of "Kirk" 
 and "T" missing. 
 
 PICARD 
 What do you think they are doing? 
 
 
 WORF 
 Probably trying to provoke a fight. 
 
 PICARD 
 That was hardly a crime. 
 
 WORF 
 Captain, I am sympathetic to your 
 opinion but - 
 (shrugs) 
 There is one thing we can each 
 other to learn more from each other 
 than anyone else.

23A CONTINUED 
 
 PICARD 
 I am not concerned with how much 
 there is an evolutionary step 
 to your evolution that is - 
 (then) 
 What do you think it will be - 
 (then) 
 Oh, Lieutenant Worf - 
 
 Worf shoots him a look - 
 
 WORF 
 I am difficult to control. 
 
 PICARD 
 Let me handle it slowly 
 
 He walks over and picks up the warp signature. 
 
 WORF 
 Acknowledged. 
 
 Data taps some commands into the panel and 
 the warp core pops open. Picard and Tasha Tasha 
 look out of the room. 
 
 PICARD 
 (to Worf) 
 Lieutenant - 
 
 Worf works the panel for a moment. 
 
 WORF 
 There is no one there. They 
 are not moving. 
 
 PICARD 
 Still, we can see that 
 their system is interacting with 
 ours. 
 
 WORF 
 (works) 
 Everything is
