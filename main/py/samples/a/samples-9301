 one, a 
 
and all too, 
we do have a plan 
for crossing that 
interference point, we 
would move 
 
beyond all known 
energy constraints and 
 
we can travel 
around worlds 
without being harmed 
by them 
in exchange for information 
about the Kelaran 
 
HUMANOID 
Our presence in the Delta 
quadrant will raise tensions 
 
and draw their attack upon us, 
in case the Kazon forces 
attain any more attacks.

REED Captain, they are clearly off-key, 
but we cant ignore them 
because they seem 
like savages. 
KIM I have tried all the 
communication systems 
 
I still cant get a response from anyone. 
 
PKE You get no response from anyone, but a few dozen others 
have suggested an attack 
 
is the only way 
to get a signal out. 
 
Theres nothing 
unusual about these people, 
especially these on the low 
Vodges. 
 
PKE What do they want, 
 
of course? 
 
(Kazon Ship) 
 
(the group are in their small 
quarters, just finishing the communication 
imulator) 
TUVOK They see. 
 
The Kazon is a significant power 
for us, 
or a weapon of war. 
 
(noticing a knock at the door) 
TUVOK Acknowledged. Have we 
successfully completed our mission, 
Dou? 
 
TUVOK Success is none. 
The Kazon has been 
invasive on neutral freighters 
for almost three years. 
 
TUVOK That is not good enough, Lieutenant. 
 
The Kazon is not a warm-blooded 
benevolent race for that. 
 
BARCLAY That was my observation, not the source. 
TUVOK There is no reason 
for such a deceit. We have no proof. 
 
The Kazon have never proven 
any weapons. 
 
And when the opportunity 
becomes clear, the Kazon will move 
immediately out of the 
favor of the Kazon. 
 
They do this without their regard. 
 
They do not smile. 
 
PKE You are sure this was some kind of 
exchange? 
 
TUVOK I would say 
 
mysterious impressions, 
though some, were inconsistent.

CHAKOTAY Come in. 
 
JANEWAY Im here. Meet the Ambassador. 
 
TUVOK I shall prefer to review the evidence here myself if, 
 
and see if theres any basis for your theories. 
 
JANEWAY Id like to see those comments privately. 
Be my guest. 
 
TUVOK Certainly. However, it is essential that we speak privately. 
 
JANEWAY And I will. 
TUVOK I have been studying Earth history that 
your Earth has not been my home for a long time. 
 
I have come to conclude many 
points, Captain. On the basis 
of everything, your beliefs are 
fantasy based on nothing but material 
experience and passion. 
 
PKE They are all gone, Tuvok. 
 
BRN They will go. 
 
JANEWAY I will speak to them. 
 
PKE In small words, they will listen. 
 
KIM Captain Janeway to the Ambassador. 
 
(continues ) 
CHAKOTAY You should have considered the risks 
before attempting to expose the Kazon. 
 
JANEWAY Hes alive. 
CHAKOTAY Alive. And as the two halves of that day turn 
brn DeSalle, I promise you will never undo them. 
JANEWAY Never? 
CHAKOTAY I do. I shall assume all has been 
dealed. 
JANEWAY Never has been dealt with by the Kazon. 
 
BARCLAY Oh, never, never, never, never, never.
