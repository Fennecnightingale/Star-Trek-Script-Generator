 JACK 
 This isnt a question of whether or not you are 
 the right person to be true. I have no need to 
 stand in my way through. 
 
 The boy tries to move past the camera. Bashir keeps 
 trying to hang out some of it. 
 
 JACK 
 All right. Lets get back 
 to work. 
 
 They look at each other for a moment. 
 
11B INTERIOR CAPTAIN QUARTERS 
 
 Sisko is pacing behind his desk when OBrien and 
 Julian approach him. Both engineers are still at the other 
 station. The conference will consider the 
 allocation of the resources. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 (off Sisko) 
 I found the Defiant in the 
 Bajoran sector. Thats where 
 most of the major systems come 
 from. 
 (off Sisko) 
 Most of the systems are 
 Terran.

11B CONTINUED 
 
 Sisko leans immediately in the direction he 
 would expect to. 
 
 SISKO 
 I have already assigned Major 
 Kira with a three-month mission. The 
 Dessican system, Id expect 
 the rest to be Russian. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Its too bad you have only one 
 assignment, Captain. 
 
 SISKO 
 You are wasting your time 
 traveling through the Badlands. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 (finishing Siskos 
 work) 
 And after six months, Major 
 Kira has gone to twice. 
 
 SISKO 
 Id like to have her flown 
 to the Quadrant tonight. 
 
 Bashir isnt sure how to respond. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Is there anything you dont know? 
 
 Sisko feels his way through this. 
 
 SISKO 
 Just the major and I will be on 
 our way. 
 
 The two of them almost touch over the fact that they will 
 rendezvous here a few hours. 
 
 OBrien nods, exchanging a look with Julian. 
 
 SISKO 
 And I promise you, I wont. 
 
 BASHIR 
 (buzzling) 
 Right. 
 
 SISKO 
 (back to OBrien) 
 And I promise I wont be back. 
 
 Sisko looks at OBrien and Julian, surprised that they have 
 agreed to participate. 
 
 SISKO 
 I have already discussed it with 
 her. She has my full 
 support. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 But, you are only one-quarter 
 sure. 
 
 DEEP SPACE "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - ACT ONE 10A. 
 
11B CONTINUED 
 
 Sisko is surprised by this, but flattered, too. 
 
 SISKO 
 Tell her I will be back. 
 
 BASHIR 
 One-quarter? Not any more than I can 
 hold a blaster. 
 
 Sisko looks away from Bashir for a moment. 
 
 SISKO 
 If you are going to talk, 
 you are going to want to know where 
 she is. 
 
 BASHIR 
 Shes changing her mind. 
 
 SISKO 
 Change her heart? Just like 
 she wont be coming to 
 Cardassia Prime for another week. 
 
 He looks away from Julian for a moment. 
 
 Sisko and Kira exchange a look. 
 
 SISKO 
 How do you expect me to know? 
 
 KIRA 
 I hope Id be back, too. 
 
 A moment between them, then Bashir EXITS. Sisko turns 
 toward Kira. 
 
 SISKO 
 Id like to ask her some questions 
 though shes not going to be 
 answering them for the past six months. 
 
 She nods that shes never really 
 getting the answers.
