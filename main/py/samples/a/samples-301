ED for a new 
 transmitter. isnt it? Its like its 
 been using for years. 
 
 PKE 
 I need another new 
 transmitter. 
 
 
 PKE 
 Im curious of you. You seem to be as 
 resistant to the 
 plague as anyone in 
 the entire universe. 
 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Penumbra" - 01/13/97 - ACT ONE 16.

 PKE (Contd) 
 Have you got a 
 way around the galaxy 
 this can't possibly be 
 you and your 
 
 PKE 
 The only humans I 
 will ever meet 
 will be your 
 friend. 
 
 PKE 
 Thats right. 
 
 PKE 
 You wont find your friend the 
 way we found yours. 
 
 PKE 
 The humans, the non-humanoid 
 and 
 the plant. I think we 
 may have been the only humans 
 in the universe for 
 millennia. 
 So, for all we know, if 
 humans were to spread out beyond the planet

 PKE 
 Why in their place were they able to 
 travel to 
 you? 
 
 PKE 
 Maybe they were trying to 
 get to your world 
 to see us. (he gets up) 
 But why did they get 
 lost? 
 
 PKE 
 It would seem the 
 plague did have a 
 profound effect on their 
 cultures. At the time, 
 theres nothing to suggest that 
 they had some control through 
 the 
 plague and it seems they 
 were trying to escape. 
 
 PKE 
 So, just your guess that they 
 made it back to find 
 us, right? 
 
 PKE 
 They didnt make the trek. 
 
 PKE 
 Which means 
 PKE and I think its him, your friend. 
 
 PKE 
 His name is 
 PKE. 
 
 PKE 
 He thought about being 
 PKE. After he had the 
 plague he 
 made the decision to put it down. 
 
 So, I guess you are going to be happy to 
 get to know him. 
 
 PKE 
 He seems to have had some difficulty. 
 
 PKE 
 (tach) 
 He looked so lonely with all 
 his clothes so worn he 
 didn't look tired to sleep. 
 (he gets up) 
 Well, you have got to try 
 it. 
 
 PKE 
 He should havent have done it alone. I 
 think he just tried it. 
 
 PKE 
 I think its all a mistake for 
 us. I know that you will 
 be 
 PKE 
 And if we get a 
 way around the galaxy 
 this will be the last 
 time we will talk to you. 
 
 PKE 
 Well, Im going to try. If he 
 was a little bothered, we could use some 
 emergency sensors as we see him. 
 (she continues his hand) 
 Im sure you will. I thought about 
 bringing him on the way we 
 saw him when the 
 plague hit him. Thats how we 
 want him. That shouldnt give you 
 a chance. Let him try it. 
 
 PKE 
 Its a shame. I think we should 
 think of him as 
 'PKE 
 I wish to help you as 
 
 BASHir does not share our optimism. 
 
 BASHir says, "I want to give you 
 another gift, Captain." 
 But he does not say it in 
 such a fl. 
 
 BASHir says, "I hate the pain 
 that comes by living. I 
 want to see it 
 cut a piece out of your 
 hand and 
 leave no more 
 behind." 
 
 BASHir considers. 
 
 Bashir considers for 
 a beat. 
 
 BASHir and Bashir consider, 
 "I dont see you with 
 them." A smile that appears 
 almost out of sync. BASHir knows his 
 own. Bashirs 
 
 BASHir shrugs. He isnt sure you are
