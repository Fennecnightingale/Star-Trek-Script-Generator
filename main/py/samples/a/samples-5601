 Guest of honor. 
 
 ROSS 
 (shakes head) 
 Ah, a pleasure. 
 
 Picard takes his hand. Behind him, Riker ENTERS, also. 
 Picard has been looking forward to this for several days. Before

 RIKER

 Picard nods. Riker then fastens his arm, and 
 slowly, with great effort, reaches to touch 
 something 
 
 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 Yes. 
 
 RIKER 
 (glancing at the 
 back)

 Picards concentration is interrupted by the arrival of Lwaxana 
 from the Quarters. She is dressed 
 in a casual outfit, and her hair is in a looser

 The young woman is sitting alone at a table, eating a 
 fruitlessly toaster and sitting on a stool, which is set 
 on fire. Shes aware of the flames in the fruit 
 area. A couple of the fruitflies catch on the 
 fire, and sit back 
 (pained) 
 and the others relax, seeming to be in no pain. 
 She also regards the fruit in front of her.

 Oh, very well. If you werent
