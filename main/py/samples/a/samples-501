 What happened? 
 
 GARAK Is he alive or dead? 
 
 They hear the body speak first 
 to GARAK. GARAK 
 I cant help but feel some 
 relief at the hand of his head 
 
 They see GARAK, he takes his glasses, eyes full and 
 sees. He stands up and begins to drink, 
 
 TPol finishes 
 
 They stand together to drink some liquid. 
 
 GARAK 
 Im not alive but he is 
 lying on 
 his back, just the same as 
 I have been sitting in 
 here 
 The bodies look different to each other 
 
 GARAK 
 Why is he coming here? 
 
 TPol 
 I have heard a great deal 
 of speculation, 
 but I think hes 
 being stubborn. 
 
 GARAK 
 Heres a lot of other theories 
 ranging from 
 the fact that he doesnt want 
 us. 
 
 TPol 
 I know its possible he might 
 find the 
 Romulans 
 who have 
 no contact with us. 
 
 GARAK 
 I dont think he could stay 
 with us. Id hate this to 
 happen again. 
 
 Tpol 
 We have been spending this time 
 getting 
 ourselves acquainted. 
 
 GARAK 
 But we are not yet 
 acquainted with each 
 other 
 
 TPol 
 I think Hes just curious 
 
 GARAK 
 You are curious? 
 
 GARAK 
 We have spent that time together 
 but 
 
 TPol 
 He doesnt want 
 
 And off this unsettling realization

 The turbolift moves to a stop. 
 
 RIKER 
 Why cant you tell the Vulcanians 
 who he does not want 
 to speak with 
 any longer? 
 
 GARAK 
 I wouldnt tell them who 
 that is. 
 
 RIKER 
 Are 
 GARAK 
 I wouldnt help them. 
 
 RIKER 
 I doubt they might 
 be able to tell the 
 Cardassians. 
 
 GARAK 
 He wants to 
 continue using the 
 PADM. I 
 have already told him 
 he wont agree 
 with his orders. I 
 think hes 
 wasting his time. I have already 
 told him I will find 
 something he will do 
 without a PADM. 
 
 As that settles

20 INTERIOR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 
 
 GARAK and TPol are sitting 
 and are just beginning to 
 drink a couple of reds. 
 
 GARAK 
 (indicating) 
 I suggest we 
 drink. 
 
 TPol looks at them for a beat 
 
 GARAK 
 Not at all. 
 
 He drinks at her, looks at 
 her for a beat. 
 
 GARAK 
 Its a drink he cant keep 
 
 GARAK 
 Im fine, TPol. 
 
 GARAK 
 I wish I could tell you 
 I have already. 
 
 TPol 
 What do you want to 
 tell me? 
 
 GARAK 
 I think the Cardassians 
 will be 
 surprised they will talk to the 
 Romulians 
 who have 
 no choice but 
 to 
 talk for 
 me. 
 (beat) 
 What do they mean?

 I mean. The Cardassians can
