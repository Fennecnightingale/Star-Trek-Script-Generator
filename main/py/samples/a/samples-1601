 Mister La Forge, begin mapping 
 the Borg. Begin with the

 Aye sir, sir.

 watching along the wall monitor.

 That will be followed immediately. 
 
 PICARD 
 Do you have the co-ordinates? 
 
 DATA 
 (off console) 
 I do not. 
 
 DATA 
 I wish I had them. 
 
 PICARD 
 (to Riker) 
 Lets see if we can identify 
 him and then, once we are 
 sure of it, we might be able to find 
 an opening to an 
 emergency power drain. 
 
 DATA 
 Captain, I have increased 
 power to the internal 
 conduit. We can now 
 maintain an emergency

15B BEVERLY 
 
 She glances back towards Picard who looks somewhat pleased 
 with himself. 
 
 BRIAM 
 You were very attractive. That 
 could have been a very long 
 story. 
 
 PICARD 
 The story? It should start 
 with that. You are a 
 good writer. I thought 
 that you might enjoy your 
 imagination. 
 (beat) 
 I appreciate it, Mister 
 La Forge.
