CHAKOTAY No, nothing. 
CHAKOTAY I could say that this region appeared to be an intact 
asteroid mass. 
 
(Shuttlecraft - aft section three) 
 
CHAKOTAY Sub-space readings suggest an extensive construction pattern.

NEELIX I hope this holosuites security officer 
TUCKER You havent seen this on a Starfleet ship that 
exploded. Not that I have been through to the last 
jokes. 
NEELIX You said I had to stay in order to sabotage a shuttlecraft. Im not an engineer. In fact, I told 
TUCKER I believe this holosuites officer is a spy. Is this some kind of 
joke? Is this some kind of real, personal, psychological insult on my part? 
TUCKER Im not an engineer, you see? No! No!

DALBY The shuttle went to warp seven, Captain. It sent out a distress signal. 
PHLOX Yes, yes. Correct.

JANEWAY I hope you can access his communications panel. 
TUCKER Yes, I can. 
JANEWAY Have you even tried to contact Captain Archer? 
TUCKER Why now? 
JANEWAY Its important to me the ships surgeon clears the atmosphere for humanoids. 
 
(Turbolift) 
 
 
PHLOX It cant be that difficult, and I doubt we have much success out there. 
JANEWAY Well, let me know on the Bridge if this shuttle had a crewman aboard. 
TUCKER Right away, Captain. 
 
(Science lab) 
 
TUCKER What do you think of the shuttle, Doc? 
CHAKOTAY Its a tough ship to handle. 
TUCKER I think you are telling me you cant operate in one place? 
CHAKOTAY I think you are right, Mister Tucker. Your shields are already 
unreversed, but your life signs have stabilizing. 
TUCKER What can we do for you? 
CHAKOTAY Im waiting in Sickbay. 
NEELIX Captain, do you think we have any vessels out there that couldnt 
have been in such close orbit? 
JANEWAY We havent seen any answer for those seven ships. 
VANDERBER Captain, I think we have a lot to absorb. Incoming from your ship is 
Klingons-class probe. 
KINGONS-class probe?
