 So this couldnt work.

 They are in a tractor beam

 OBRIEN 
 (still a little doubtful) 
 They are. We cant just 
 fire on them. 
 
 WORF 
 I agree we should take them to 
 Sickbay for analysis but 
 they are in danger. We could 
 have an alternate flight plan 
 to keep them airborne until they 
 leave the planet 
 
 OBRIEN 
 So it wont be easy.

 WORF 
 It is not our only chance. 
 Even though you have one hand 
 you have another. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Good. If we can find a way 
 to fire back down, 
 we will send her right down to 
 the surface. 
 
 TROI 
 (re the holodeck 
 
 OBRIEN 
 If this 
 
 TROI 
 (over comm) 
 We are ready. On the 
 Bridge to Captain Picard. 
 
 Picard turns to see Picard behind the 
 railing. A good-looking figure with a very 
 youthful youth and a keen-eyed youth. Picard smiles, recognizes 
 the name. 
 
 PICARD 
 Yes, of course you 
 
 The figure goes to a stand and crosses the bridge 
 as we - 
 
18 CLOSE ON THE PICARD 
 
 Picard turns in the opposite direction where a 
 large, triangular area of area 
 is opening. A large white fire-structure is 
 in the central part, a grey stone-lit 
 square area of ground where the bridge and his party 
 are standing in the middle of it. The 
 bridge crew cant be seen clearly as the crew 
 move into the area. Then they see a 
 green spot with a few human form. A white 
 fire-structure is clearly visible in this direction. 
 
20 ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) 
 
 What appears in the green spot is two 
 feet from a large, wooden doorway. There is an ornamental 
 flower that resembles a flower. There is an 
 ornamental branch of the courtyard, and trees from the outside 
 are growing in like grass. 
 
 CUT TO 
 
21 INTERIOR VESSEL PRIVATE - NIGHT (OPTICAL) 
 
 They are gathered around the pool table. The place is empty. The doors are 
 inside, and two windows. They look through the open doors. 
 Tasha nods toward a yellow fire-structure while 
 Troi moves closer to it. 
 
 TASHA 
 The ventilation system has not only 
 failed. The air intakes just 
 came on-line. 
 
 VESSEL PRIMATOR (O.S.) 
 All you have to see is that it does not 
 function 
 
 VESSEL PRIMATOR (O.S.) 
 And theres something inside 
 there, right there. 
 Everything on this place is perfect and 
 smooth just as always. 
 
 VESSEL PRIMATOR (O.S.) 
 Everything you can make is perfect and 
 smooth just like a piece of 
 marble. It is perfect. 
 
 VESSEL PRIMATOR (O.S.) 
 And it is perfect. 
 
 VESSEL PRIMATOR (O.S.) 
 (still looking inside) 
 Inside, you can look at this 
 moisture. That will be 
 crucial. 
 
 VESSEL PRIMATOR (O.S.) 
 (sticking inside) 
 The VESSEL PRIMATOR can be 
 seen just in there. 
 
 VESSEL PRIMATOR (O.S.) 
 (standing by the pool table) 
 I guess they shouldnt 
 expect things like this 
 
 VESSEL PRIMATOR (O.S.) 
 And not every species
