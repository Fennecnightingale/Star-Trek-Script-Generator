 RIKER 
 (quickly) 
 Then I will have 
 to cut through the power conduits 
 to patch the VISOR with the power conduuits 
 in place, then I will need a 
 power surge to power up the 
 power conduits and I will have the 
 transporter room 
 reconfigured. 
 Heres no use to re-linking the pipes like the 
 conduits if it takes too long. 
 
 PICARD COM VOICE (O.S.) 
 Picard, I am here. 
 
 PICARD COM VOICE (O.S.) 
 I have located a path 
 through which Data might 
 be in danger.

 He then moves out the door and walks briskly into 
 the corridor, and is almost immediately hit with the sight of Data 
 sitting with his VISOR in the corridor. He stops for a 
 moment on his way to a console is then suddenly hit with 
 a shock. As his VISOR hits on Datas console, 
 and Data jumps to the floor, falls backwards, hits his 
 body with his VISOR. He collapses backwards 
 
 DATA

 You are not going to make it very 
 far.

 Data does not take his VISOR seriously and 
 walks forward. His VISOR is gone, he is staring straight 
 ahead, not like normal people but this time 
 he appears unsure but then he looks up curiously. 
 
 DATA 
 (indicative to 
 him, an edge) 
 My VISOR has gone 
 off, sir. I can no longer 
 locate my VISOR. 
 
 RIKER 
 (puzzled) 
 Data you are missing something. 
 
 DATA 
 What? 
 
 RIKER 
 (interrupting, to Geordi) 
 Geordi, warp ten. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Sorry, Data. 
 
 Geordi and Data run back again. Finally, DATA 
 
 PICARD COM VOICE

 GEORDI 
 (continuing) 
 He was right in that corridor. 
 
 GEORDI 
 A group of people has 
 located us for the 
 Transporter pad. 
 (begging for a 
 visual) 
 I dont know who they are, 
 but I have a visual to 
 do if Im in some kind of 
 trouble with them. 
 
 PICARD COM VOICE (O.S.) 
 Geordi, you have the bridge.

 The group of people exchange a look in 
 puzzlement and surprise on Geordis VISOR. Geordi 
 stands and walks up. The group of people have asked 
 themselves where we are 
 
 TASCA 
 I have got a visual. 
 
 TASCA 
 Well you are sure you are correct? 
 
 TASCA

 Then what what do you think? 
 
 TASCA 
 My VISOR has gone.
