======== SAMPLE 1 ========
  I got a different spelling. 
 
 They both look around. Wesley is studying one section 
 of circuitry 
 
 GEORDI 
 We are going to be right here you 
 got to get out 
 
 Wesley ignores him and starts to sweep the 
 circuitry from the 
 console in their hands 
 
 WESLEY 
 (interrupting and exiting) 
 See? This circuitry gets 
 back to us, and we will have to 
 keep it from rust 
 
 GEORDI 
 (hesitant) 
 (following her gaze) 
 But what if we planted it on the 
 engine? You can fly 
 freely around it, just make 
 one final attempt -

 WESLEY 
 We think of it like this 
 for instance. We might be able 
 to hide and rendezvous with their 
 ship 
 (shaking off a wager) 
 - and deploy the communications 
 satellites to extend 
 our signal to their shields. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Aye sir 
 (to Wesley) 
 We could try that 
 
 WESLEY 
 I think we will win the race. 
 
 Wesley looks about the room, not a chance to 
 win by any chance.

 WESLEY 
 We may have to eject the 
 core.

12 CONTINUED (3) 
 
 WESLEY (contd) 
 To destroy the core? 
 
 GEORDI 
 The gravity of the 
 nacelles breaks it up 
 here - this ship is 
 carrying alloys and samples 
 - 
 
 WESLEY 
 Then I guess you have got a lot ofÂ 
 choice. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Well, certainly, I could move inside 
 this shuttle to refuel. With 
 star charts to lay traps, 
 make rounds of it. 
 
 WESLEY 
 Right. 
 (to Wesley) 
 Can we use the data 
 consoles to navigate Lieutenant 
 Commander Data? 
 
 WESLEY 
 Understood. Mister Data, would you 
 like to have a look at this? 
 
 DATA 
 Yes. 
 
 The three of them move to the aft of the 
 shuttle and begin to navigate together. 
 
13 INTERIOR SHUTTLE - INTERCUTTING 
 
 PICARD 
 Ensign Crusher will handle the 
 navigation, Lieutenant, 
 but you will be in communication 
 with Mister Picard. You will 
 never be in command or in 
 command of a vessel unless 
 you are given an approved 
 track record.

13 CONTINUED 
 
 PICARD 
 I will be there. 
 (to Wesley) 
 Lets throw them off this 
 radar. 
 
 WESLEY 
 Red alert. 
 
 The red alert sounds and a siren sounds. 
 
 WESLEY 
 Warning. Two more sirens 
 up. 
 
 The lights come on. 
 
14 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE SHUTTLE (OPTICAL) 
 
 The Enterprise veers off. 
 
15 INTERIOR SHUTTLE - INTERCUTTING 
 
 PICARD and Beverly come together into the cockpit. 
 There are familiar faces between the pilots and the ship. 
 Beverly is holding her hands and looking at the 
 viewscreen. 
 
 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 Lieutenant Commander Data and Geordi, Doctor 
 Crusher, and Data, Lieutenant 
 Commander Data, Lieutenant 
 Commander Worf, and 
 Wesley. Welcome to the twenty-fourth 
 century. How about you? 
 
 On their different reactions 
 
 FADE OUT
