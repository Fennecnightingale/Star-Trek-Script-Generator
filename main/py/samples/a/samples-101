 mask. He

 It must be perfect on. 
 
 Dax does an excellent good his best. As he does,

 Dax the mask again.

 as he picks a point on both sides of the bridge. As he 
 picks up the mask, it turns 
 on him. He picks 
 up the mask and 
 OBrien throws it to Kira, who 
 puts the hooded head down, holds it up 
 (to Jadzia) 
 Who are you? 
 
 Jadzia is confused.

 SISKO 
 Commander Leeta? 
 
 Jadzia, too confused by 
 the hooded head (she stops) 
 You know the man. 
 Thats our man. 
 (she reaches out) 
 But I should not be 
 mistaken. My daughter knows 
 all about him. 
 (to KIRA) 
 I wish you good to 
 see her 
 and to speak of him. She knows everything. (she is the only one of its kind) 
 I didnt give him a courtesy when he told the stories of 
 his friends 
 KIRA 
 And in a couple of months, he will be a big deal in your heart

 (she stops) 
 And he knows it. In fact it would feel 
 like it was taking a 
 long time for me to see the 
 right

 Geordi and Troi do the same thing. He is too 
 confused and too afraid to move.

 That could be it. But you know, KIRA! 
 
 AOJA 
 (quiet) 
 Do you know what this instrument is? 
 
 AOJA 
 Oh. Well, what we discovered, Commander. We cant find the instrument in 
 the galaxy. Maybe I found it, Commander. But its 
 very old in human 
 history. But its
