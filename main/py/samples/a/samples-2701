 Look, isnt be like me. 
 
 DAX 
 I dont know you didnt come into any 
 complaints. 
 
 Lwaxana smiles. 
 
 Lwaxana knows this is a bad guy, but hes trying to save 
 it from you. 
 
 LWAXANA 
 I got to talk to this guy. 
 
 Dax gives her a look. 
 
 DAX 
 Where are you going to go? 
 
 Lwaxana shakes her head - 
 
 Lwaxana 
 Its about his age. 
 
 The whole crew turns to look - concerned. For some 
 reason Sisko and Dax have to be so concerned about 
 this.

 Where a massive wall is created. A large, 
 circular one-dimensional object lies just below

 DAX and Lwaxana are seated behind her, working at a 
 console. Her monitor sounds vital on the monitor -

 No, I mean its bigger to the

 You mean it looks

 Lwaxana looks at Daxs monitor - 
 shes still not completely convinced.

 From 
 
 DAX 
 A good thing, too. 
 
 Lwaxana glances at Dax, her head still on her own 
 concerns. 
 
 Lwaxana pauses for a moment, then turns to look on 
 the screens - Daxs turn is away, far from her in the 
 way her usual. The ship is rocking like it 
 was twenty years ago, but the engines 
 are identical in design - and all the 
 creatures are exactly alike. 
 And off their resemblance
