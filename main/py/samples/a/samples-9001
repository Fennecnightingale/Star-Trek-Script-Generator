, but it also provides us with a 
 sense of foreboding. It kicks Picard up on 
 a little table. 
 
 DATA 
 The Enterprise has been 
 attacked by a massive attack 
 - one man 
 dies immediately. 
 
 PICARD 
 (looking around, sees 
 Worf) 
 That attack on the Enterprise 
 was pre-incident! 
 (to Picard) 
 Why would the attackers have hit on 
 us so far away? 
 
 Troi has no idea. The question is whether this is 
 an attack and a co-incidence. It 
 would mean an additional attack. 
 
 TROI 
 (continuing) 
 This cant be. You will 
 either use the phaser banks or open 
 up a new set of equipment. 
 We have to choose between using one 
 of your ships and continuing to 
 destroy you at whatever the end 
 is. 
 
 Picard glances around the room for a moment.

 PICARD 
 You cant destroy us while 
 we are still in shock! We have 
 to leave now. 
 
 His voice cuts through the tension. 
 
 PICARD 
 (to the Council) 
 Open up a hailing frequency. Tell 
 them we want to honor the 
 Enterprise. 
 
 They nod to me. Off Picards face 
 as he faces the Council 
 
 FADE OUT.

 RIKER, Data and Worf as before. They 
 appear to be in uniform (with a stripe of 
 Starfleet insignia), but have lost their 
 phasers. They are standing in front of 
 a MAIN VIEWSCREEN which shows an image of the 
 Enterprise is in orbit around a PLANET. 
 
 DATA 
 Captain, there are five ships 
 within range of us. 
 
 RIKER 
 Then the Enterprise must be at 
 low impulse. 
 
 DATA 
 (grim) 
 Engines are failing. 
 
 WORF 
 Enterprise, they cannot fire when 
 they are still in civilian 
 territory. 
 
 Picard turns and taps the console. 
 
 PICARD 
 We are in desperate situation. 
 We must evacuate the ship. 
 
 The VIEWSCREEN is FRITZING with STATIC.

 DATA 
 (to Picard) 
 Tell Commander Riker they may 
 have help. 
 
 Picard rises, does something. 
 
 PICARD

 dont like to feel that 
 side of you

 RIKER 
 And then I should attack you with 
 a shuttlecraft that has 
 obviously gotten caught in an 
 explosion 
 
 PICARD 
 (shouting) 
 You saw this yourself, Commander. 
 This is a new weapon for your 
 organization. 
 (to the whole Bridge crew) 
 We and the Federation will need 
 both of our ships. 
 
 Worf is appreciating the sentiment, but doesnt quite 
 understand it. 
 
 WORF 
 Starfleet is a good at peace. 
 They certainly is not 
 ready when they attempt to 
 fire on us. 
 
 RIKER 
 Oh, you look that way, Mister 
 Worf. We should not be 
 allowed to engage the Neutral 
 Zone. Its not a neutral operation. 
 (to Worf) 
 We are gonna win this. 
 
 Worf is an anguished, staring at him. 
 
 WORF 
 You do not understand.
