======== SAMPLE 1 ========

 (a beat) 
 I dont know the answers, but I do know 
 
 TASARAN 
 I will find you, Dukat! I 
 will not forget you. I 
 will let you come with me. 
 
 Shes got him back to his seat and grabs him by the 
 collar. 
 
 DUKAT 
 Do you hear that? I have been 
 gone for six days. I have been busy. I 
 havent slept much. 
 
 TASARAN 
 Me neither. 
 
 TASARAN 
 I do believe you. 
 
 TASARAN 
 (thunder) 
 Arent you not feeling too 
 bad?

 TARAX 
 No, no. Im happy. 
 
 Hes been in the living area too long. 
 
 TASARAN 
 You go to bed? 
 
 TASARAN 
 I think you have got it too hard. 
 
 TARAX 
 Harder than he thought. Not at 
 least not hard more. 
 
 TASARAN 
 I can get the harder part. 
 
 TASAN 
 Im ready for whatever you 
 think. Im ready for whatever 
 you think is best for the 
 rest of the world. 
 
 TASAN 
 I just do. And I will let you know 
 when we get the chance to 
 see the Dosiian star system 
 
 DAX 
 If its a star system and this is the 
 thing you have been dreaming about 
 since you left the house. I think you 
 need to try this, the Dosiian 
 star system. 
 
 TASAN 
 (a slight) 
 It may not be easy, but that star 
 system is located very close to the 
 wormhole. If you are hoping to 
 be back on the station, its 
 still possible to see the Dosiian 
 system. 
 
 TARAX 
 If we try to move inside the 
 Ferenginar star system we can slip 
 through the graviton distortion and our 
 beams are already hot to the 
 plasma stream. 
 
 TASAN 
 And we will take the risk. We are not 
 going anywhere. Im no fooling them. 
 I know, but we cant go even. If Id 
 lose twenty days to work out an escape pod, what 
 long would we have to work out?

 TASAN 
 (sarcastic) 
 Even if we wanted to escape, we 
 could only spend a short time aboard. And to 
 that end of all this time, we couldnt turn 
 the tables on the table and still be 
 half-way across the room.

 Its all in the past. 
 (to DS9) 
 But it wont be our worst 
 but its our opportunity to be 
 lucky. If you can make it

 There isnt much left to
