 ODO 
 Chief? 
 
 He looks at his viewscreen.

 ODO 
 Its not the same. 
 The same thing that 
 is in your throat. 
 
 Hes turned on the viewscreen. 
 
 ODO 
 Its not the same 
 
 He turns again, looks out the 
 window. 
 
 ODO 
 But you are not going to 
 die from old age. 
 
 ODO 
 (hint of 
 self-satisfied, 
 smug smile) 
 Maybe not, but there may be 
 other things happening 
 
 Off the viewscreen.

 the resistance movement. 
 
 Argyle steps to his feet and turns. 
 
 ARGYLE 
 (to self) 
 Come on, lets do something to get 
 you up. 
 
 Kira and Dukat move to help. 
 
 KIRA 
 All right, let this moment 
 be your first. 
 
 DUKAT 
 The moment when? 
 
 KIRA 
 When you have an idea. 
 
 Dukat turns and approaches. Kira and Duk 
 watch behind them. 
 
 DAX 
 The Dukat knows we have the 
 locations of the Founders

 DUKAT 
 I have a better idea.

 KIRA 
 I do have one question. 
 
 Dukat 
 Are you sure? 
 
 Kira answers with an honest look 
 on her face. 
 
 KIRA 
 If this really is what it 
 was designed for, you have
