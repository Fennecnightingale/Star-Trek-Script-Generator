 It should be an little suspicious about the 
 Dominion. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 It would be nice to see that youd 
 take this on.

 5 INTERIOR CAPTAIN READY ROOM 
 
 Worf has been in command all afternoon. 
 
 WORF 
 We are making a decision, Captain. 
 Its the moment. 
 
 Worf takes his seat in engineering and looks at Data at the consoleÂ 
 to see if hes just a random piece of 
 the old man who walks off the bridge. Worf takes a beat to think, then stops 
 and looks at Picard.

 PICARD 
 Worf could have made a mistake in the 
 name of Chief Medical Officer, but I would 
 not be so sure. I will take that 
 on my shoulders, Mister Worf. 
 
 Worf looks at him in surprise then, with a bit of concern 
 here the rest of his face falls on the desk. Off Datas expression as well - that hes been in this 
 for the past forty-six hours with this kind of concern 
 for the past ten days. Theres nothing to be 
 embarrassed about. 
 
6 INTERIOR CAPTAIN READY ROOM 
 
 Worf has had enough time to get lost and ENTER the door. 
 His expression is grim as he turns and heads back to 
 Geordi. 
 
7 INTERIOR CAPTAIN READY ROOM 
 
 Worf enters the room, as the doorway CHIME.

 WORF 
 Captain. 
 
 Geordi looks up and sees Worf. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Come here. 
 
 Worf is very busy staring at Data when he enters and 
 frowns. 
 
 DATA 
 Captain Picard. 
 The Captain will 
 be calling me if she discovers 
 you are not, Captain. 
 
 Data looks around. 
 Suddenly, Data looks at Worf. 
 
 DATA 
 Why dont you just say bye? 
 
 Worf looks at Worf, his expression as cold as his 
 expression. 
 
 Worf takes a beat. In that pause, 
 Worf stops with Worf. 
 
 WORF 
 No no. Not at all. 
 
 Worf considers for a beat. Then he shakes his head, 
 realizing that he is not going to get it. After 
 a beat, Worf realizes there is something wrong with 
 the Captain. 
 
 WORF 
 (firms) 
 I know. 
 
 Worf takes off his dress uniform. 
 
 WORF 
 (re clothes) 
 I never had anything like that. Never mind.

 WORF 
 I have come to say, thank 
 you, Mister Worf. 
 
 Worf stares at Worf. Off-duty. He turns and turns and looks at Worf 
 who is staring after him. 
 
 DUKAT 
 Data. 
 
 Worf, who has his hand on Worf, stops and looks at Worf. He is a little taken aback by 
 the exchange of glances between Worf and he. 
 
 
 WORF 
 (dry) 
 Data, there are times when I need 
 a certain amount of physical activity. In 
 fact, usually the most efficient form of 
 protestance is to take it myself - I dont need 
 an answer. 
 
 Worf stares at Worf, trying to get under Worfs feelings, 
 annoyed by the fact of a question and hes not quite sure 
 willing to say it. 
 
 WORF
