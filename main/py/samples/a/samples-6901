 The two of them are facing the camera as Sisko starts to move at them. Suddenly 
 Tavar, a young girl named EUREKA, appears. 
 
9 EUREKA 
 
 is standing on the stage of Siskos arrival, a ten-square-eyed demon 
 wearing a cloak and a skull-sized, gongy display 
 at the end. 
 
 EUREKA 
 You have taken refuge in here. 
 
 Sisko sits the stage so that Eulka can "listen" 
 his speech. 
 
 SISKO 
 I appreciate your efforts. 
 And my response to you. 
 
 EUREKA 
 
 The Resistance Cell has been 
 silenced. 
 
 She points a phaser directly at him. No one sees 
 this from the back. 
 
 SISKO 
 Id like to speak to the Central 
 Archives. 
 
 EUREKA 
 You have been listening to the 
 news. Its my belief that the 
 Dominion has been putting 
 new units in the Gamma 
 Quadrant. 
 
 SISKO 
 We havent been covering the Alpha 
 Quadrant. 
 
 EUREKA 
 This may be. We have the most 
 of those ships left 
 available. And we may be holding the 
 world as well. 
 
 But Ezri doesnt believe this, herself. 
 
 EUREKA 
 We have a lot to discuss, Captain. 
 In the meantime, I will be going back to my 
 home.

 KIRA 
 That may be the best idea. 
 
 EUREKA 
 (smiling) 
 Better? Whats wrong? 
 
 KIRA 
 You have a meeting. 
 
 EUREKA 
 
 I had a meeting? 
 
 KIRA 
 Dukat, the Ferengi. He met them at the 
 entrance to the bar. 
 
 Eureka shoots him an look. 
 
 EUREKA 
 It was my pleasure, you could see 
 it? 
 
 KIRA 
 It was about time you arrived. 
 
 Eureka turns to leave, but there are others 
 waiting for her. 
 
 EUREKA 
 (with caution) 
 Id like to know the meeting was held 
 here - somewhere else. 
 
 KIRA 
 What would you like? 
 
 EURKA 
 I want to know where. Its where 
 we are going. 
 
 With that said, she makes up her hoarding arm and 
 heads for the door. 
 
 KIRA 
 What if I dont find the Founders 
 who attacked your station ? 
 
 EUREKA 
 When you find them, you will want to know 
 who. 
 
 A beat, before Eska replies. 
 
 EUREKA 
 (back to business) 
 It has an unusual power 
 source in the Gamma Quadrant 
 Quadrant...

 KIRA 
 How it? 
 
 EUREKA 
 Our ships are cloaked. 
 
 KIRA 
 What do you mean? 
 
 Eureka is hesitant, unsure. 
 
 EUREKA 
 The Defiant 
 is mine. We cant just go in there 
 without a battle certificate. 
 
 KIRA 
 Of course. 
 
 Eureka realizes theres no reason to 
 go any deeper - theres nothing to hide. 
 
 EUREKA 
 Well. Its my understanding that you 
 have asked the JemHadar to evacuate 
 more than a thousand JemHadar 
 units which they are attempting to 
 forcibly disarm the Dominion 
 there are a number of ships 
 that have been inoperative for over a 
 year that have had the same basic design. 
 Whats your understanding?
