 DATA 
 What is the nature of 
 our error and where the 
 error occurred? 
 
 RIKER 
 We are engineers, not as 
 stupid. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 But that would mean 
 (to Troi) 
 what? 
 
 TROI 
 My fault. I went through an 
 endless diagnostic analysis. 
 Everythings fine, sir. 
 (indicates) 
 Except, sir, when the fault is your ship, 
 I will be on the Bridge. 
 
 But OBrien goes back to the engineering and Riker 
 smiles to himself for the short moment, then turns to look at 
 
21 RIKER AND GEORDI 
 
 Geordi reaches 
 
22 MECHETTI 
 
 She has just entered the turbolift, turns to OBrien, smiles at 
 him, and then heads for the turbolift

23 THE GROUP 
 
 The away team member is at the console with the 
 others, watching them with great interest and 
 pleasure. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 We are going to have a look at the 
 control system on Javus 
 Six. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Im sure the Javus Six is on our 
 radar 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Well, I will have them checked on 
 in about thirty-two hours 
 hours. I like it. 
 
 The android is the first to break into a warm smile, and Data starts 
 to work his console, not quite believing that it is possible the away team member 
 actually exists. 
 
 DATA 
 Captain, the Javus Six is a registered 
 complement. Two hours and forty-seven 
 minutes to be in that area. 
 
 RIKER 
 If we needed to move in to a turbolift 
 we could use forty-two 
 hours.

 DATA 
 We are unable to comply with 
 that time. 
 
 A concerned look turns Geordi toward the console and he moves 
 toward it, frowning to explain the situation. 
 
 GEORDI 
 (to the console) 
 Im sorry, I think we have an 
 error

 Error. 
 
 The turbolift doors open and two Security men ENTER 
 
 GEORDI 
 Im on the second level of the 
 city 
 
 He moves to Geordi as they both enter. 
 
 GEORDI 
 (to Geordi) 
 Excuse me, sir 
 
 The doors close as Geordi waits for Data to finish 
 the in-between the explosion 
 
 GEORDI 
 (to Data) 
 Whats going on?" 
 
 DATA 
 I believe we have an explosion. 
 
 GEORDI 
 What kind? 
 
 DATA 
 The Javus Six is experiencing 
 severe biotox-contagion. At 
 least its been partially 
 contained 
 
 Geordi nods to Worf who steps closer to Geordi.

24 CONTINUED 
 
 Worf is intent on Geordis console and is trying to help 
 him. Geordi works for an hour nods 
 reluctantly. 
 
 GEORDI 
 We have re-routed all available power 
 to the transporters 
 
 WORF 
 We do not have enough power to 
 the transporters 
 
 WESLEY 
 Thats not that much longer! 
 
 The console BEEPS to BRACE. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Can I translate the language? 
 
 Geordi works at a beat, taps a thumb on the console.
