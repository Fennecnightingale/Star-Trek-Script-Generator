 ion at his feet, staring at the wall 
 the door like an impostor trying to 
 break into some kind of 
 pancake. Worf is staring and he cannot help but 
 keep talking his response business-like with him. 
 
 WORF 
 (beat, to a soldier 
 in a green uniform) 
 I do not understand.

 LARKINS 
 It will be opened. 
 
 Worf stops dead in his tracks, looks down in a daze that he 
 isnt entirely comfortable with. He takes a deep breath, nods for a 
 beat. 
 
 WORF 
 Good ladie, a lot of men seem to 
 make poor choices. 
 
 Worf looks on with disapproval. A grunt, a grim 
 shoulder. 
 
 WORF 
 Sir, I want a word with 
 you. 
 
 LARKINS 
 Its not necessary. Tell me, Worf, 
 I got a bad conduct discharge. 
 I was earning profit. 
 
 WORF 
 (frowns, shrugs, with a 
 bit of guilt) 
 You may have earned profit, but 
 you cant do it 
 
 OFF Worfs face 
 
 CUT TO 
 
15 INTERIOR WORF QUARTERS 
 
 where a small, bare room with a few PADDS of 
 the wall and a small VIEWSCREEN is arranged on the 
 wall. A small, twin-sided, port-locked, twin 
 pieces of furniture are up. Two small pieces of furniture 
 of clothing are down and two small pieces of clothing 
 lie forward, so the room is comfortable. Worf is 
 wearing a pair of boots and boots and wearing a small 
 cantisomer cap, like a pair of sneakers. The table is a 
 comfortable, casual, one-size Bajoran and a smaller pair of 
 cuffs. He is dressed in one of his normal uniforms. 
 
 WORF 
 I am not comfortable with a larger 
 pair of boots.

 WORF 
 (a pair of boots) 
 I am not comfortable with a small pair. 
 
 Siskos the small one and stands in a 
 direct line with the leader of the room, watching 
 the crowd out as Worf hands him the small one. Then 
 Worf notices the small pair and gives Worf a hand so as 
 he moves his hands. After a beat, Worf picks up on Worf. 
 
 WORF 
 I never thought Id say this but, I 
 dont believe it. 
 
 OFF Worfs face 
 
 CUT TO 
 
15A INTERIOR DEFIANT - SICKBAY 
 
 Where Bashir and Odo are checking a clear bag when 
 Worf ENTERS he clearly seems agitated. 
 
 BASHIR 
 Didnt you notice he was in 
 Quarks just as we were. 
 
 Odo isnt buying his story when he spots Worf in the 
 room.

 ODO

 BASHIR 
 I just dont understand 
 (beat) 
 Were we in line 
 
 ODO 
 What are you doing 
 (beat as Bashir gets 
 a good look at him) 
 Did you just get in Quarks. 
 
 BASHIR 
 I was checking the replicator 
 (gets a bottle from the 
 ground) 
 No, its not us. 
 
 We hear a glass of water MATERIALIZE in Quarks 
 bottle 
 
 WORF 
 (to the air) 
 A nice, thick liquid
