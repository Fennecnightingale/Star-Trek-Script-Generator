 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 Yes, Captain? 
 
 PICARD 
 Beverly, are you there? 
 
 BEVERLY 
 I was sent by the 
 captain, Commander and by 
 my first officer. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 Yes. Im Beverly Crusher. 
 
 PICARD 
 Well Beverly Crusher was so 
 nice, Beverly Crusher I do 
 apologize, but 
 
 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 I was at your 
 ready room, preparing to depart 
 
 PICARD 
 Well is the Captain so 
 quiet? 
 
 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 In his personal logs, 
 he did say "quiet". 
 
 PICARD 
 Hmm. "The Captains personal logs 
 are not unusual, 
 Beverly. 
 
 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 Yes. 
 
 PICARD 
 Im very concerned about 
 Lieutenant Sarek and were 
 interested. 
 
 PICARD 
 Were you aware that his marriage 
 has been terminated? 
 
 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 No. 
 
 PICARD 
 I was supposed to study her 
 new crew. 
 
 PICARD 
 That is an important matter, 
 Doctor. She and I 
 must agree on a personal 
 matter. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 I understand this has been well 
 talked about and Im sure it 
 doesnt mean we had a bad 
 couple but you have got to take it 
 out on me. 
 
 Picards not about to admit defeat.

 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 Beverly, I know the difference 
 between a personal matter and 
 a command. 
 
 She nods, but she clearly doesnt believe this for a 
 moment. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 Sir, I understand you have a 
 daughter. It is a younger woman. 
 
 PICARD 
 Interesting. Interesting.

 It appears on your mind. 
 
 PICARD 
 We both understand the complexities 
 of human emotion. 
 
 She seems to struggle to control it, 
 but Picards not about to admit defeat. 
 
 GARAK 
 I suggest we begin by exploring 
 the possibility of a family. 
 
 PICARD 
 (to Picard) 
 Perhaps I will talk to the man 
 of Sarek. 
 
 She nods and EXITS.

 Picard smiles, shakes his head sadly, smiles 
 
 PICARD 
 I miss her terribly. 
 
 She laughs. 
 
 GARAK 
 I will miss you too, Captain. 
 
 She nods to himself, then does a somber 
 tear down on his cheek. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 I know you were in love, 
 Jean-Luc. 
 
 He is clearly conflicted by this woman, and he 
 steers to her. 
 
 GARAK

 presently in Starfleet, 
 Jean-Luc
