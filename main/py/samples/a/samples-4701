 SISKO 
 That was a joke. 
 
 QUARK 
 They were going about this different when 
 I told you to hang up with me. 
 
 In response to Odo and Siskos joke, Dax begins to make her 
 joke. 
 
 DAX 
 You see, I really should have known and Id 
 seen that it was not a joke. 
 
 A beat as Sisko and Dax react to what they see as their 
 first "serious" violation of the Cardassian 
 Code. 
 
11 INTERIOR SECURITY OFFICE 
 
 ODO and Sisko are making some progress working on security 
 measures, but Bashir 
 is not enthusiastic about them. 
 
 BASHIR 
 Odo, when did you realize that the 
 Cardassians couldnt hold you? 
 
 Odo looks around the room and then spots a 
 Cardassian security officer in the lower level. Hes 
 wearing the uniform uniform uniform, but hes not 
 sure what to do about it. 
 
 BASHIR 
 (still looking at 
 security officer) 
 Lets go. 
 
 Odo and Bashir EXIT into security office. 
 
11B INTERIOR SECURITY OFFICE 
 
 Where OBrien and Bashir are having dinner. OBrien has a PADD, which 
 he sets on a table near his head. He signs up his personal code 
 and it is displayed in front of him. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Cardassian security. I should have told them 
 when we were leaving, and they 
 sent me down here to update 
 us about the plan. 
 
 BASHIR 
 We were always talking "not bad," 
 Chief. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 I never knew how much I 
 felt about our experiment. 
 But its only good that was 
 underfoot. 
 
 OBrien gets a glass from the replicator and 
 leans down and looks down at his PADD. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 This must be a real place to 
 work on. 
 
 BASHIR 
 I was afraid it didnt have 
 everything to do 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Well, I hope it makes sense to me. 
 I hate to be seen in here, I 
 still dont feel anything about this 
 station looking under my watchful-looking 
 handwriting.

 Bashirs look away. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 So have you told them where 
 Im going? 
 
 They share a look. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Okay. 
 
 Bashir begins searching a hidden door on the 
 station, looking for a way to get the others 
 out of the hidden. 
 
 BASHIR 
 (pleased) 
 You are in a holding cell, 
 Commander. 
 
 OBrien and Bashir each pick up a PADD, which they keep 
 on. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 (pleasantly surprised) 
 Where are you going? 
 
 OBrien starts to scribe on a hidden PADD. 
 
 BASHIR 
 (pleasantly surprised) 
 Where are you going? 
 
 OBRIEN 
 To my cell. 
 
 Bashir nods and moves to OBrien. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 (hopeful) 
 Do you want a look at? 
 
 BASHIR 
 No, it just looks good. Besides, 
 its not locked. 
 
 OBrien looks for something to talk to. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Come on. 
 
 BASHIR 
 What is it? 
 
 OBRIEN 
 What does look like? 
 
 He can see that Bashir knows that too. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 (re the PADD) 
 Tell me its not locked. 
 
 BASHIR 
 (still skeptical) 
 I wonder how those security 
 checks are
