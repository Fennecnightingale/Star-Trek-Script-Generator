======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 need; The Breen attacked us. 
TORRES Looks like they have succeeded. We have been prisoners inside, where I 
was. 
PARIS Well, the first thing we know, they are going to finish what they started. 
TORRES You know, it helps being in one place with a Captain override, huh? 
HOGAN Our hunger is dying. 
TORRES Then we are going to find a weapon. We only have a few hours before the 
neurocortical implant is introduced to cure. I will 
definitely remember something. 
 
(Borg vessel) 
 
(Tuvok is also at a table, picking a meal 
up in the direction Chakotay is sitting.) 
HOGAN You should be with somebody. We bring the blood soup with me. 
TORRES What are they? 
HOGAN It was a mistake letting the Borg to use the water crystals. 
TORRES Now its not a minute too late. We have been the only 
ones here for two days and we have already seen our post and 
replicator ripples. Please keep away from messes. 
HOGAN Im fine with you. 
Prelot? 
HOGAN I will make a few changes in the kitchen while 
we still have room for the new sauce. 
TORRES (OC) Torres to Sickbay. You will look like 
someone. 
 
(Sickbay) 
 
EMH She isnt responding to conventional treatments. I might be 
incapable of some behavioural effects, but she 
couldnt possibly be unconscious. 
NEELIX Perhaps her nervous system could have another 
signs of anxiety. 
JANEWAY Can you treat her? 
EMH I cant, although that would slow the process of finding 
out. 
JANEWAY Doctor, do you know any other women on the 
Neelix? 
EMH Not yet. 
JANEWAY I will run more tests and tell her the next one in the 
kitchen. I will make an announcement when the bell stops. This is 
the Neelix. Tell her we are on time for bed. 
EMH Aye, Captain. 
TORRES (OC) Torres to Janeway. 
JANEWAY Go ahead. 
TORRES (OC) Janeway here. 
JANEWAY Report to Torres. 
TORRES (oc) We have found a neutronic probe. Its on the 
neutrino side of the main sensor network. I 
couple of units will make up the bump. 
JANEWAY T to the main engineer. 
TORRES (OC) This is Torres, the doctor to the Bridge. 
I will be in my ready room. 
JANEWAY Im curious, Lieutenant. Who does this equipment belong 
to? 
TORRES These are power distribution nodes that draw energy from the probe, 
and act as a trion or weapon. Its a Borg-inspired weapon used in close range combat. 
JANEWAY I got it. 
TORRES Oh. 
PARIS (OC) I think I have just stumbled across some last time in there. 
TORRES I will make a few adjustments to the new guidance mechanism. 
PARIS (OC) This time I found them in the back room. 
JANEWAY Any of them. 
TORRES Of course. 
 
TORRES Well, with that kind of power distribution system 
it doesnt make any sense to me. 
PARIS Any of them? 
TORRES What, exactly? 
PARIS Any! I didnt know theyd used to be on the 
holodeck. 
TORRES In there, they were all back into the Doctors quarters. 
PARIS Well, I mean you have had a bad time in there. 
You know, with their help theres more. 
TORRES I never thought Id get away with this one. 
EMH I will make this one of my own. 
TORRES I just want to see it. 
JANEWAY I will ask my Captain to let you on a rare case of 
incident. 
EMH I couldnt. 
TORRES (OC) I just wanted to get to know my back on duty. 
TORRES (OC) Im not feeling very well, I need to 
take the case with me for a little while. 
JANEWAY My Chief Engineer tells me your repair unit is functional and 
can man your stations for a year.
