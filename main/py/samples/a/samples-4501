. 
TUVOK The nebula has subsided. The starfield has been 
CHAKOTAY Acknowledged. 
TUVOK Still no conclusive match, 
Captain. I am unable to discern what is happening. 
 
TUVOK The nebula is collapsing. 
KIM What kind of seismic 
forces are responsible? 
TUVOK Possibly seismic in origin. 
JANEWAY Source? 
TUVOK Unknown. 
TORRES Im picking up dilithium signatures, likely a formation of 
some kind. 
JANEWAY Take us into bio-spectral resonance. Lets find a 
exactuated site to site. Activate the bio-spectral antennae. 
 
(Sickbay) 
 
EMH Welcome to Sickbay. Its been a long day for me. 
JANEWAY This is the Starship Voyager. What is your medical emergency? 
EMH Emergency? 
JANEWAY Im not certain. I was on a course to Chakotay and was 
aboard Voyager. 
EMH After being found, a man was pulled out. 
JANEWAY Where was your origin? 
EMH Im not sure I have a clear route to Starfleet medical. I have been out 
of contact with the Talaxians. They have been ordered to take me back to the 
Dr. Sojiab, but I could not bring myself to do the surgery. 
JANEWAY You did everything by the book. Its all right, EMH. 
JANEWAY Im so sorry. 
EMH Not at all. 
JANEWAY Im sorry. We thought youd be thanking for the company or youd have mentioned that I 
said the entire crew had been taken 
off the ship? 
EMH Apparently so. 
JANEWAY You know where all of them went? 
EMH Im not sure exactly, but according to their ships navigational 
database I found out about four and a half dozen 
mariners stranded in a nebula together the 
same ship that we found. 
The ship carrying them was the most experienced ship we 
ever saw. Only one was killed by fire. 
TORRES This isnt the third incident this week. 
CHAKOTAY Im reading reports of an additional crew. 
JANEWAY Source? 
TORRES It was Voyager the first to self-induce theta emissions 
atmosphere, but it was mostly solar. I got him to open a 
star window, then he got sick. 
JANEWAY Im picking up lifesigns in the lower platform of the 
explosion. They are being resuscitated. Well, brace yourself for the 
special gravity. Im getting a great workout in a 
microcentrum cell. 
TORRES Im already going on a microcentrum cell. Its already starting to 
tolerate. 
JANEWAY How do I get the co-operational system? 
TORRES Im doing the same thing. No one moves until I first take 
the infusion. 
JANEWAY Find the best time to repair the damage you have done. Find a 
way to the base of operations. 
PARIS Aye, Captain. Mister Tuvok, start scanning the asteroid field. 
Set a course two two four mark two. 
 
(Briefing Room) 
 
TORRES Right. 
JANEWAY Take a look at these co-ordinates. 
PARIS I have got them. Stand by. Tuvok, download the file. 
JANEWAY What are they? 
PARIS Its some kind of space. 
JANEWAY A starship? 
PARIS I dont know. This space, it seems to have a 
contingency. 
JANEWAY We are picking up life signs. 
BEATRICE (OC) and BEATRICE (a single man in a wheelchair) sitting on the floor 
separating the two xenon disrupters. The Doctor and I are 
supplying the patient some bio-neural gel. 
JANEWAY What are you doing? 
BOATRICE (OC) We have detected a group of life forms on the 
surface. 
KES I dont know. Some kind of insectoid? 
TORRES They seemed to be dead. They are trying to run through some kind of 
abiotic solution. 
TUVOK I have been looking at the corpses from the other room. I cant get a clear on either
