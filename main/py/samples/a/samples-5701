 and a few we will need to 
 
 BASHIR 
 Is it? 
 
 DAX 
 There will be a chance you never get them to 
 accept you exactly, Julian. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 We are on the best of luck. 
 
 BASHIR 
 Thats a good reason to make it a 
 complete day. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 There isnt a better plan. 
 
 BASHIR 
 There have to be some way to 
 complete your 
 dream. 
 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Whats that supposed to mean?

 OBRIEN 
 Trying to reach Starfleet? 
 
 QUARK 
 Its a big job, but I dont 
 know if we can find a way to 
 access Starfleet records. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Maybe. 
 
 QUARK 
 That sounds like you may want to 
 have to get your mother and Uncle Quark 
 to the Observation Lounge or call 
 day. 
 
 QUARK 
 Dont worry I didnt mean to be 
 cranky, but we will get through 
 this. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 But I want to be able to prove 
 to them that we are telling the truth, 
 Julian. Any other 
 Romulan refocusment? 
 
 QUARK 
 We will just be a little hazing. 
 
 QUARK 
 (dismissive) 
 If we really needed this, youd 
 be happy to let them make up. 
 (off console) 
 If you are feeling all smiles, stop whining 
 and come forward. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Bashir, Im not whining. I is 
 happy. 
 
 QUARK 
 Im not whining. I are 
 feeling better. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Bashir. Im a shower man. 
 
 QUARK 
 (shaking his hand) 
 I know. You never really wanted to 
 admit to 
 
 QUARK 
 I dont like the way I look.

 QUARK (Contd) 
 (indicating Odo) 
 Better hide out. 
 
 QUARK 
 I know. 
 
 QUARK (contd) 
 To do what? 
 (to Bashir) 
 Its a big planet, Julian. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Is this some sort of a planet? 
 
 QUARK 
 Its not landable because of 
 the ionization in the atmosphere. 
 
 QUARK 
 How about a few days in 
 astronomy and you can start 
 to relax about it for a while. 
 
 Quark EXITS. Odo watches him go. Bashir watches him go, then 
 
 QUARK 
 Whys that? 
 
 Bashir nods he believes hes too calm until Quark 
 makes his offer. Bashir isnt used to being 
 cut the mood. He follows and tries to offer another 
 coin. 
 
 QUARK 
 Whys that? 
 
 BASHIR 
 Im taking you to a planet 
 called Trimark Three and you will 
 have my full support. 
 
 QUARK 
 Whys that? 
 
 BASHIR 
 Friends of mine are going 
 to love it. 
 
 QUARK 
 Friends? Well, for 
 you at least, in my universe, 
 you are not just friends. You 
 are a friend. 
 
 BASHIR 
 Im not going to love it here either. 
 Im not going to walk with you. 
 
 Quark nods and Bashir moves on. A beat, then Quark turns and 
 walks out of the door. 
 
 BASHIR 
 Where did you go? 
 
 QUARK 
 Im playing an old game, right? 
 
 QUARK
