======== SAMPLE 1 ========
., its hard to believe 
 
 ODO 
 Couldnt it be some sort of 
 changeling 
 
 QUARK 
 I have been down here since about ten 
 hours. 
 
 DAX 
 So when came you here, did you 
 just walk out of here? 
 
 QUARK 
 Oh, I stopped you from going 
 anywhere. 
 
 DEEP SPACE "Dax" - 11/18/92 - ACT ONE 13. 
 
13 CONTINUED (2) 
 
 ODO 
 (still suspicious) 
 Maybe I was just imagining things. 
 
 QUARK 
 I know. I could do anything. 
 Just remember. 
 
 ODO 
 Thats strange. I think I 
 saw you dancing girls in a funky 
 dress this morning around the 
 promenade then you were 
 telling people Id 
 never join. 
 (a beat) 
 Quark. I think you see where I could 
 possibly move in and out of this 
 room. 
 
 QUARK 
 So, I wouldnt think of it. 
 Odo was working in the bar 
 
 ODO 
 So you knew he was here to 
 meet with the Chief? 
 
 QUARK 
 Was I? You are talking about a lot 
 of options? 
 
 ODO 
 I wish I could talk about all 
 of them, but Im thinking of all 
 the options you will 
 be able to choose. 
 
 QUARK 
 Is this actually the only way to 
 contact me? 
 
 DEEP SPACE "Dax" - 11/15/92 - ACT ONE 14. 
 
13 CONTINUED (3) 
 
 ODO 
 (still suspicious) 
 Maybe its enough. Maybe we 
 should all heads for the other 
 door. 
 
 QUARK 
 (skeptical) 
 Yes the only other door? 
 
 ODO 
 Actually, theres one other thing. 
 (a beat) If youd like, I will let you know. 
 
 ODO 
 I appreciate your concern for my 
 welfare, but if you dont know 
 anything about my life youd 
 better leave. 
 
 Quark cant help but notice that Odo wasnt just 
 talking about him anymore. 
 
 QUARK 
 So why did you keep to this 
 late? 
 
 ODO 
 I did I dont want to keep you to 
 yourself, Quark. Besides, its 
 all I need for my work right now. 
 
 QUARK 
 What will you do next? 
 (then sees the 
 puzzled 
 look on Odos face as he 
 leaves)

 KIRA 
 (to Jake) 
 You look great. 
 
 JAKE 
 How can you be so calm? 
 
 KIRA 
 Someone to take your mind off of problems 
 for someone who never worries you. 
 
 JAKE 
 What are you saying? Im 
 worried about taking over his 
 life? 
 
 KIRA 
 Maybe you should talk about 
 it maybe this way 
 
 They come to a fork in the road. 
 
 JAKE 
 I dont know if hes really alive. 
 
 They try invert the Waning Wall - something Bajoran, 
 Garak and Nog is aiming at. 
 
 QUARK 
 (aiming at Nogs 
 direction) 
 Take about twelve yards. 
 
 JAKE 
 Got that. 
 
 ZERO 
 How far are we and how fast are 
 we? 
 
 DAX 
 In less than twelve yards, I can save you! 
 
 ROM 
 (to the Nog in his right 
 look) 
 What have you saved us? 
 
 QUARK 
 They will probably get us out of running. 
 
 NOG 
 (run, stop) 
 What if I run while Hes 
 still alive? Theres no way to 
 save us. 
 
 JAKE 
 Everybody stop. 
 
 KIRA 
 How are we supposed to beam 
 someone out here
