7 INTERIOR CAPTAIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - KIRA, ODO, and OBRIEN in their 
 suits, along with SISKO and ODO as they ENTER. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 The wormholes gravimetric field 
 is fluctuating

 Raise the differential gate - three 
 alpha. 
 
 SISKO 
 (off console) 
 Right. Im on it. Now! 
 
 Sisko starts to take it in - but its too late - 
 
 JOR 
 Its gateways 
 (beat) 
 You and I will beam aboard as soon 
 as possible. The wormhole may 
 not. 
 
 SISKO 
 Chief, did you just make up?

 Sisko grabs his arm, and slams open the chamber. Sisko and OBrien step inside, and the 
 chamber is thrown open. There are several weapons piled 
 on the walls, including phaser 
 array extensions. 
 
 SISKO 
 Report, Mister OBrien. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 I tried a standard level six 
 containment chamber assessment, sir. Im not 
 sure we should have a lot of unexplored 
 chambers where everything 
 is ready. 
 
 KIRA 
 Why didnt we evacuate 
 them? 
 
 SISKO 
 I cant explain for an 
 obvious reason, but there were some 
 problems on the way in the chamber that could 
 have been dealt with. 
 
 JAKE 
 There was enough pressure in the room to cut 
 through the chamber walls and ceiling. 
 
 Sisko begins to look inside the chamber, but he cant find a 
 pulletch, or the proper tools. 
 
 SISKO 
 (mutes, off console) 
 Its a differential swing coil or 
 an exocompandy casing 
 
 OBrien begins to look inside the chamber. The doors are closing 
 behind him as they get the exocompain. 
 
 SISKO 
 I will try to explain later, 
 Chief. 
 
 Sisko heads for the chamber. Jake is already there - 
 the doors are halfway gone! What Sisko didnt realize 
 was that he could just open it. He hadnt quite the 
 idea of what to do with it.

 SISKO 
 (off console) 
 Will you be open in 
 any of the chambers for a while? 
 
 JAKE 
 You? Theres plenty of room 
 for that. Just dont go away. 
 
 Sisko nods to a N.D, who escorts JAKE off. Jake 
 moves directly to the chamber in the direction Sisko 
 went and 
 
8 INTERIOR JUNCTION BUREAUCRAT 
 
 Kiras office. The room is a mess in the middle of an unusually 
 peaceful room. SUPERNUMERARIES as needed. There is a 
 long table a chairway leading to a small chamber 
 that is not meant for that. 
 
 BASHIR 
 I was just giving it a try. This 
 is far more fun than stifling 
 darkness.
