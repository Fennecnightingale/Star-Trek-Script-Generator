======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I with us - that we can see, 
 
 We will make other plans have 
 nothing do with us. 
 
 PICARD 
 You are asking if the 
 captain can be trusted? 
 
 RIKER 
 I cant be sure. But 
 its a good thing its 
 a good thing he does 
 
 PICARD 
 Good? Is the captain 
 feeling he could step outside the 
 Neutral Zone for a fair 
 day? 
 
 RIKER 
 My people are very sensitive day 
 to such things. The 
 Cardassian Neutral Zone is a 
 dangerous place to begin.

11 INTERIOR TORPEDO BAY 
 
 Picard, Worf and a SECURITY OFFICER surround 
 the torpedo in the middle of the night, 
 watching it grow. The ball is 
 on the floor and Worf has got a 
 small rough piece of it - a small ball 
 that he plays with. (NOTE Throughout that 
 sequence, Beverly encounters with 
 Romulan guards.) 
 
 PICARD 
 (to Torpon) 
 Let he graze. 
 
 TORPON 
 Did this become part of her 
 plan? 
 
 PICARD 
 Thats what I want to 
 discuss here - if the 
 situation on the bridge is 
 any more tense, it could lead to 
 a serious breach in the bridge. 
 
 Torpon turns around and leads Picard and Beverly toward the bedroom 
 
 TORPON 
 Im afraid theres been 
 no more important 
 to me. 
 
 PICARD 
 (disgusted) 
 How can I be truly confused about 
 this? 
 
 TORPON 
 Because I have no place to 
 look. At the moment, it is very 
 small, very insignificant. 
 
 PICARD 
 You are asking if the captain 
 of a starship? 
 
 TORPON 
 Absolutely. 
 
 Picard pauses for a moment. 
 
 PICARD 
 You are going to have to be in a 
 holosuite for a full year to 
 lose. 
 
 TORPON 
 (bewildered) 
 An eight year. 
 
 PICARD 
 (disgusted) 
 Eight years. Well then - 
 you must have spent every 
 day. 
 
 TORPON 
 It sounds really small for me to go 
 to warp ten and it still 
 takes years to become a 
 Ferengi and a Federation 
 starship. 
 (takes a hard ball out of 
 a sleeve) 
 It took me a lifetime to 
 save every baseball game 
 in baseball 
 
 Picard considers for a beat.

11 CONTINUED 
 
 PICARD 
 In some ways, yes. On 
 the other hand? It took you a 
 lifetime to save that ball 
 out of all the competitions. What about your 
 team? What am I supposed to do? 
 
 TORPON 
 Its a big decision. Im 
 surprised it didnt come up 
 sooner. 
 
 PICARD 
 Actually, it did. And I have been 
 waiting for it for some time. 
 
 TORPON 
 Really? I didnt mean it. 
 
 PICARD 
 I was quite honest. This 
 shouldnt become a difficult 
 transition for you. 
 
 TORPON 
 (relaxing) 
 It will make sense. We have been 
 waiting for two months. 
 
 PICARD 
 The key to our winning is 
 making the right decisions. 
 If we had more time to 
 review all the potential 
 some of the 
 possible futures of the past, 
 we might not need words 
 
 TORPON 
 Thats what I meant. It 
 is a decision that has immediate 
 consequences for all of us. 
 To begin with the obvious 
 premise that we are given 
 to start. 
 
 PICARD 
 (taps combadge) 
 Pec.
