======== SAMPLE 1 ========

The((the door explodes) 
I wish it were worse. 
TUCKER I wish that they didnt exist. 
(a woman comes to them) 
THOMAS Im a Starfleet officer. 
TUCKER No we are not. 
PHLOX Any indication from Starfleet in any way? 
SHOT Theres no indication. 
TUCKER Well theres no indication, and yet, the Federation has to 
governing it. The question is, what kind of threat do you have? 
 
(PHLOX) 
 
TUCKER No one was aware of what the Dominion was doing when 
they were trying to kill Koraga. The Federation was waiting for 
KIM Theres a threat. 
 
(Porthos arrives) 
 
MIRRUS I hear we were the last ones, but I was in other 
parts. 
TUCKER The Dominion is trying to take control of 
the Borg. Which is their goal. 
MIRRUS Yes. 
SEVEN No. 
PHLOX They are in a joint effort. 
MIRRUS Then how do we keep Koraga from stealing 
his weapon? 
SEVEN You want that. I have already taken the 
command of Earth. 
PHLOX All of us think about your offer of a century. 
SEVEN Yes, I have, but I would not accept it if 
other worlds do. 
SEVEN Thats not the offer I made. 
MIRRUS Why not? 
SEVEN You, me, or the Borg. 
MIRRUS You want to see me change the rules. 
SEVEN I cant change to any of us, if you are not 
going to. 
MIRRUS You are in no mood to see me change anyones rules. 
SEVEN Yes, sir. 
MIRRUS So, when you are here, you 
have got them. 
SEVEN They are in the Borg Collective. 
JANEWAY Lets see them. 
MIRRUS (OC) We have arrived. 
JANEWAY You know, I have got more to 
do with this. 
SEVEN (proud) 
MIRRUS Do you really think the Borg will 
be satisfied they can take Earth back? 
 
(Borg walk towards the center of the 
Cargo Bay) 
JANEWAY The Borg have made too many sacrifices. 
BARGH What are you talking about? 
JANEWAY They are dying because they dont have 
to be in Starfleet. 
BARGH You cant go to Starfleet for a little 
more than a thousand years. I must warn you. 
JANEWAY We are in no mood to be 
responsible. In fact, we havent much 
dont to be on this ship. 
BARGH You dont seem to be sure what I mean. 
JANEWAY The Borg want too, but its a 
little too late to be concerned. 
BARGH We have already activated the 
Nomad on Earth, but Im not sure you 
can make heads or tails of that transfer. 
JANEWAY We will see you try. 
SEVEN I need to be taken to the 
Federation. 
 
(Delta Flyer) 
SEVEN The Federation has made enough progress in the 
past three decades to create a 
peace and tranquillity. 
The Federation needs more 
time in a holosuite. 
JANEWAY Our military superiority is 
unacceptable, and the Federation cannot be 
too involved with a large Dominion fleet. 
SEVEN We will have to deal with the 
Dominion to protect Earths 
from another Dominion. 
JANEWAY A good idea. 
SEVEN I will accept that plan, but this 
isnt enough. 
JANEWAY We still have a 
disquietude for the Dominion. 
SEVEN The Dominion has yet to 
approach their space. The only way I believe 
about their intentions is if we find 
them and try to stop them. 
DU.S.S. No Starfleet ships to 
fly in Dominion space. 
LEVEL Now, tell me what we are going to do 
next. Which ships? 
 
(Delta Flyer, C.C.) 
SEVEN If we see the new JemHadar 
signal, we will join our forces immediately.
