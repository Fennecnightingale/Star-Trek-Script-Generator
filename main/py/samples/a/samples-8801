 OBrien turns on a control. A small 
 BUZZ - and the warp field just BLINKING OUT. 
 
12 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE RUNABOUT (OPTICAL) 
 
 At warp. 
 
13 INTERIOR RUNABOUT (OPTICAL) 
 
 OBrien and Worf - still in standard uniforms - are getting ready to leave, 
 and they are carrying some PADDs. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Heres the fleet-wide 
 maintenance report. We need to do 
 something to catch up on 
 how much longer we have 
 got before the 
 Dominion 
 continues on with us. We might 
 be able to avoid a 
 needless visit for an 
 instant. 
 
 WORF 
 Good luck, sir. 
 
 Worf EXITS. OBrien nods to Worf - EXITS with the PADDs.

 STAR TREK "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE 15. 
 
15 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL) 
 
 as Riker ENTERS from the turbolift and crosses to see OBrien. 
 The first time this exchange happens in the 
 background. Riker is sitting at one of the tables, 
 and OBrien is at the bar. Worf tries to smile, but 
 instead of appearing to be in a public image. 
 Riker looks around the bar, takes a moment in 
 order to access a PADD 
 
 RIKER 
 This is Commander Riker. I was 
 taken as an ingressor and you are 
 the first officer who visited 
 one in the history of 
 this mission 
 
 WORF 
 (nods) 
 Theres still the war 
 that washes going to continue 
 
 RIKER 
 When we have more of this 
 time we know what we are 
 facing. Lets try to 
 change some things 
 
 Suddenly something catches Worfs eye - 
 
 NETT 
 Lieutenant Worf 
 
 Worf is so startled he cant speak for a moment. 
 
 WORF 
 (stiffens) 
 A Klingon ? 
 
 Worf jumps up, startled. 
 
 WORF 
 Where was A Klingon? 
 
 WORF 
 Oh my brother from 
 Kvoknolos. His business is 
 to repair. 
 
 Worf looks around, sees something on a 
 nearby table - repairs it, then notices the 
 Ferengi bartender - sells over the bar "gift." 
 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "A Fistful of Datas" - REV. 2/15/96 - ACT ONE 16. 
 
16 OVERLOAD - TROI 
 
 (re the latinum) 
 A red lump - but nothing that hits the bar. 
 Worf smiles. 
 
 WORF 
 Thank you. For giving me 
 a gift? 
 
 No response. 
 
 WORF 
 The gift is from you, Mister 
 Worf. It suggests that 
 I will be able to receive it 
 someday. 
 
 RIKER 
 (re the gift) 
 Its pretty elaborate. 
 
 WORF 
 It is to be honest, sir, if 
 I were to be honest. 
 
 Picard turns to Worf, who smiles. 
 
 PICARD 
 As long as you are able to 
 retain it and find 
 out what it is, I think 
 I can remember it. 
 
 Worf eyes the Klingon. 
 
 RIKER 
 I wouldnt lie to you, Mister 
 Worf. But you would 
 want to hear this Klingon 
 lieabout 
 (turns to Bashir) 
 and this time I will kill you. 
 
 Worf is stunned to hear this, but he stands. 
 
 RIKER 
 Sir, if we were to 
 find a Klingon who 
 had this ability to change 
 someone, somebody else 
 might come out of 
 Kvok Nor. 
 
 WORF 
 Thats not what I saw, 
 Commander. 
 
 Worf looks around a moment, then notices something
