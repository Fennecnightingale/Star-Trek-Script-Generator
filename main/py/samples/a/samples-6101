======== SAMPLE 1 ========

 is a 
 Siskos in a good mood today, I can see 
 that he, too, appreciates what he has done for this 
 hour, and the way that he seemed to proceed on the path 
 of his own. 
 
 DAX 
 It sounds delightful. 
 
 Sisko looks away uncomfortable with Worf, but 
 I cant control him. 
 
 DAX 
 If you could just call 
 me - she would have called you. 
 
 SISKO 
 If I have been anything like you 
 I have a hard time 
 
 Worf nods. 
 
 WORF 
 Good luck, Commander. 
 
 And he EXITS. 
 
 DAX 
 (calling after him as a 
 farewell gesture) 
 I can tell you you that when all 
 gone, I will never forget what you left of 
 in 
 (sees that Bashir and OBrien 
 have been keeping a very 
 long watch on him) 
 
8 ANOTHER ANGLE 
 
 As the JemHadar steps up to the Bridge. The 
 JemHadar soldiers surround and OBrien behind. 
 They all stand looking at Worf as he works a console 
 They all turn to see - the JemHadar - standing to the upper 
 ramp, blocking the way. Bashir goes over to them and speaks the same 
 terreacon in a hoarse whisper. 
 
 DEEP SPACE "Armageddon Game" - REV. 11/09/93 - ACT ONE 17. 
 
8 CONTINUED 
 
 OBRIEN 
 The JemHadar are... they are fine 
 they respond even to talk in 
 private. They are fine. 
 
 They are now moving into position in a new formation, trying to 
 penetrate their target. But now they are pushing their fire on the 
 JemHadar soldiers. 
 
 WORF 
 They are still moving forward. 
 
 We see the JemHadar army rally and draw in their 
 firepower. The JemHadar fighters take Aim, then they 
 target Worf which he retaliates with a GRUN. They are the first to 
 attack on the JemHadar ship. 
 
9 BREEN SOLDIER ONE 
 
 standing in the lower Terrikon Bridge. The soldier, SUBCOMMANDERLY, is a 
 young, attractive female, even a little too attractive to be the JemHadar, 
 and BEEPS. His weapon is hidden in his civilian clothes that he concealed by a bulkhead 
 planted on the wall, or with a hidden weapon embedded in the bulkhead. He 
 shows no sign of the JemHadar soldier, who might be a BORG, but we 
 still cant see his face. He is unheveled, has been to see his face 
 before. He does not raise his weapon, but clearly he has no doubt that he 
 already KNOWS his reason. 
 
10 ANGLE TO VIEWER (OPTICAL) 
 
 as Kasidy approaches the JemHadar soldiers and we see 
 that it is ANOTHER JemHadar soldiers, all Bajoran-born except for Worf. All of 
 them are staring at Worf as he moves to join them they all. 
 Everyone else is waiting for them to move in with an 
 appreciative shock. 
 
 KASIDY 
 All of them, they are not going 
 willingly to surrender. 
 
 Sisko and OBrien exchange a look. Sisko is 
 surprised and a little surprised the other JemHadar soldiers, who 
 do not 
 want to surrender, then step up to Worf and OBrien, who 
 nod politely. Sisko moves back to the JemHadar soldiers 
 
 SISKO 
 (to Worf) 
 They have only got one down in the 
 Dominion base thats all they are 
 here for. 
 
 Everyone on the Bridge reacts to this sad news. Bashir is at the 
 medical console as Worf works. 
 
 BASHIR 
 They have got the JemHadar ship. 
 
 SISKO 
 Forward velocity is down at 
 ninety kph. We are losing 
 impulse engines its too slow to take 
 home. The JemHadar are trying to 
 escape by firing phasers but their 
 phasers cant fire because 
 they are still down. 
 
 SISKO 
 How many die?
