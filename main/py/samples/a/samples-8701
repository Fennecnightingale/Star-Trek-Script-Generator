 HOGUE 
 Deck two. 
 
 SISKO 
 Number One? 
 
 KIRA 
 Its good to be with someone who 
 understands what its been like out there. 
 
 SISKO 
 (surprised) 
 Really? 
 
 KIRA 
 You know more about my people than anyone 
 on the station and Im a more 
 useful person. 
 
 SISKO 
 How do I know you dont take sides? 
 
 KIRA 
 (glancing at the tricorder with 
 him) 
 Because you have never gotten much use 
 of my combadges. 
 (defensive, then a bit 
 suspicious) 
 I just hate to be accused of stealing 
 it off a young lady.

 KIRA 
 Shh. Thanks. 
 
 Sisko tries to leave, but Jake stops him, tries to 
 explain to him, his mind is not clear. 
 
 JAKE 
 (smiles) 
 That was an old mistake. 
 
 Sisko EXITS, leaving behind a concerned Bashir.

13 INTERIOR SURGERY 
 
 As Bashir ENTERS to find ODO, KIRA and a few Bajoran 
 MEDICAL TECHNICIANS, surgical equipment and equipment. Every one of them is dressed in SCARRED, at their 
 temples. The medkit is next to a large bulky device called a 
 TOS. 
 
 Bashir examines the device, feeling somewhat dubious about this is 
 the most sophisticated device found on the station. Odo 
 leads Bajoran doctors to a large chamber which they can 
 use as a diagnostic chamber. 
 
 ODO 
 This doesnt look like an interrogation 
 chamber.

 Bajoran technicians prepare to go along, using various tools 
 available from the chamber. Bashir ENTERS from the chamber, not only 
 as he heard that Mollox is working on a closed panel inside 
 the Tos. As he approaches, Odo notices the chamber. He opens it, looks inside, and 
 gets a face full of light to his eyes. He then drifts inside to find 
 Mollox, Briam and Gai. 
 
 BRIAM 
 Is it true? 
 
 ODO 
 You are being executed for 
 treason against the Federation? 
 
 BRIAM 
 You have the right to refuse to answer 
 questions, but to begin with 
 you being guilty as a leader of the 
 Bajoran resistance. 
 
 OBRIAM 
 Yes, I have heard that what has happened in 
 my office has not found 
 my home planet among the 
 Hutherans. 
 
 BRIAM 
 Your home planet is the one 
 Im interrogating you for 
 treason. And you are 
 telling me you want to get off 
 that planet. 
 
 ODO 
 I have explained the Federation 
 officials I think you are 
 being set up. Its a long 
 story, but Im sure you dont like to 
 put me in the Chamber of 
 Ministers. 
 
 BRIAM 
 (resigned) 
 Then I suppose Im obliged. 
 
 He EXITS and the CAMERA follows. Bashir turns to Quark 
 
 BRIAM 
 Why dont you tell Mister 
 Odo we are going to interrogate 
 you for treason 
 (touches a circuit with 
 Bashir) 
 and give him a chance to 
 regain his freedom. 
 
 QUARK 
 (putting order) 
 Im afraid he will want to speak 
 with you about what you have 
 accomplished. I have learned a great deal 
 about you. 
 
 BRIAM 
 In the last three days you have 
 done to
