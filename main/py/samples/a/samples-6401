6 CONTINUED (3) 
 
 BASHIR 
 If its still the same thing that makes 
 you go, your father will want to have a very 
 hard time apologizing. 
 
 Offi moves to stand alongside the crowd, looks 
 around in momentary surprise. While hes doing this, 
 Odo sees Odos face. 
 
 OFFI 
 Isnt it true? I never really 
 think. 
 
 Odo realizes his weakness and decides he might as well speak with this 
 fellow. 
 
 ODO 
 (re the Posters) 
 You have enough of this. 
 
 Off Odos face sinks heres his last shot. 
 
7 GARAK 
 
 Just cant wait another day, Garak. 
 
 GARAK 
 I agree, I agree to the 
 use of this 
 
 GARAK 
 I agree. I agree. Now I will go. 
 (to Bashir) 
 And first of all, let me apologize 
 for bringing you here without 
 your permission. 
 (smiling) 
 Im afraid you will have to, Garak. 
 (smiling) 
 I think its all right. I have 
 made a lot of things work together and 
 I can focus on doing it 
 
 ODO 
 Then theres one thing we have to 
 talk about. 
 
 GARAK 
 Its the same thing you are saying 
 all your time now. 
 
 ODO 
 I did the same thing when 
 I was young and I had a lot of 
 experience with Garaks 
 father, but when he wasnt 
 as worried about me as 
 one individual anymore that was, as 
 he was. We were working on a 
 holosuite story together 
 
 Off Odos face as he loses his touch of 
 this moment

 Re-establishing.

 The Promenade has taken center over the 
 moment of the night. With the twilight growing 
 through the Promenade, Odo moves to begin the 
 walk with Sisko follows him 
 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "What You " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 10. 
 
7C CONTINUED 
 
 ODO 
 (to Sisko) 
 The two of you are walking back 
 at the rendezvousÂ 
 coordinates? Is that how you greeted 
 Garak? 
 
 SISKO 
 I greeted him the day before. 
 (embarrassed) 
 I assume you have spoken to 
 many of your senior officers 
 today. 
 
 ODO 
 I did. And I spoke briefly 
 with a Bajoran representative 
 named Vedek Bareil 
 Bajoran a few hours before we 
 arrived this is about the first time you have seen 
 Im here 
 
 Garak stops in the middle of the Promenade, glances with 
 a look to Sisko, whos looking after him 
 
 GARAK 
 My friend, if I am going to lead this 
 movement, I must know my 
 "best friend" is you. I think that 
 youd agree to attend to your 
 needs 
 
 SISKO 
 I would. 
 (off Odos reaction) 
 I suppose you could spare me for half 
 if you insisted on it, Vedek Bareil 
 that you know him hes a very 
 influential voice inside me 
 
 Garak doesnt like Siskos attitude, so he 
 pushes him away off. 
 
 ODO 
 (strong) 
 Then there are some rules 
 I dont want to hear. 
 
 Garak glances at Bajoran #3 
 
 Bajoran #2 
 You have heard from his good 
 friend, Vedek Bareil 
 Bajoran what you have done here is 
 treason. You
