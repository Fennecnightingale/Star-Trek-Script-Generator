KIRK Good. 
SCOTT All right. Sir, he is gone now. No one knows what caused it, but its out there somewhere on 
course. 
KIRK Kirk to Sickbay. What happened to him? 
UHURA (OC) Locked in on me, sir. Sickbay. Captain Kirk. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> PART ONE 
KIRK Captains log, stardate 3546.6. Starship Enterprise is orbiting a planetoid system. It is 
named Earth. 
(Bridge) 
 
(The ship is at Red Alert) 
SPOCK We are holding orbit, Mister Sulu. 
SULU Normal orbit. 
SPOCK Sulu, Mister Sulu, it is under subspace control. 
SULU Lock in on an orbit around that planet. 
HOSHI What happened, sir? 
SULU (OC) Negative. 
HOSHI Where is everyone? 
SULU Just within that starship, sir. 
HOSHI Who are you? 
SULU (OC) You know? 
HOSHI Who are you? 
SPOCK Im Captain Kirk. This is Lieutenant Spock. 
HOSHI Thank you, Mister Spock. 
MCCOY Jim, I dont know who you think you are. 
HOSHI Im a friend of Doctor McCoy. 
SPOCK Im the nearest starship in this section, that is where the wars began. 
HOSHI Is there some information we can share? 
HOSHI Yes, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK Are you certain, Doctor? 
HOSHI What war? 
SPOCK The planet below us was called Earth. 
HOSHI I know your people will make an official census to ascertain the cause of our war. 
HOSHI Whats that all about? 
HOSHI Are you certain 
SPOCK I cannot risk letting that planet pass by without some records, and Im afraid the Earth outpost system is too heavily fortified and fortified. 
HOSHI You seem to be the most logical assumption about humans. 
MCCOY Oh, now, just a minute. 
HOSHI What war means now? 
SPOCK I would have to elaborate it. Now, should I take it on my own? 
HOSHI It sounds more logical sometimes. 
SPOCK May I assume your Earth-like feelings about it are a warlike. He is a nation whose ancestors fought at great war to claim it. How they led the way to this war, why have their war ended? 
HOSHI And now, sir? 
SPOCK Your Earth people led the way to this war, and in the final effort gave them everything they wished. Your Earth was yours. You did not forfeit your own life. 
HOSHI And to lose that war, you dishonoured the treaty the way through which the Earth people died? 
SPOCK Its all over now, Doctor. May I add, with the result of your own defeat, your Earth victory was celebrated. 
HOSHI We ought to celebrate our victory. You are victorious. 
SPOCK May I be the first winner. Your Earth, the setting of which the war began. 
HOSHI But, Spock, Earth had to be invadeded. We would have stayed in Earth orbit for years because of your victory. And now your people, the millions of people from our planet. 
SPOCK Perhaps it will serve us well in long life. 
MCCOY Oh, well we wont. 
HOSHI Why not? 
MCCOY They are going to need to rest. 
HOSHI Well, all we have got here is four months to rest, but we wont be able to let 
them forget about our war with the Klingons, our three hours duty days, we wont rest on Earth tonight. We want you just to know how you feel 
COMPUTER All senior staff report to the bridge. 
SPOCK Casualty reports, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT Aye, sir. 
SPOCK Acknowledged, sir. 
SCOTT All senior staff report? 
HOSHI We are losing strength in both shields, sir. They are both going to take some kind of damage. 
KIRK (OC) Mister Sulu, begin Science One. Mister Scotty, take over. 
SCOTT Aye, sir. 
MCCOY Come on. You will be fine. Dont worry, Bones. Lets get you over with.
