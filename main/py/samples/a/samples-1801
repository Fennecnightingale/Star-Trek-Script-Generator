 The others around 
 take turns studying one another - 
 
 A BERIE 
 What makes you choose 
 you as a priest? My 
 beliefs and your life vision are 
 unmatched. Im a worthy 
 man, worthy even my standards of 
 decency and morality. 
 
 The others are amazed. This conversation is not easy for them. 
 They have the difficulty of choosing between the two ways which 
 have always been the same to them.

 A MAN, YUTIA - a man of his advanced years - 
 and this is KOROTH, the one seated next to 
 the statue. A MAN - this will be the 
 first time the Bajorans have been made worthy of my 
 sacrifice - 
 
 KOROTH 
 - has the Bajorans learned that 
 sacrifice doesnt work with men like you, 
 Minister. They prefer to focus 
 their minds on ways capable of doing things rather than 
 on ways that can be perceived as threatening. 
 
 The others stare at him as well with surprise and 
 derision, but they do not argue on this. 
 They simply stare at Dax as they did with OBrien, in 
 wonder. And they keep their eyes closed. A man is a very 
 man - a doctor, with deep sympathies and a 
 genuine sympathy for the man. 
 
 KOROTH 
 (interrupting) 
 You know what the matter 
 is, the faith of the priests 
 is the only way to survive this 
 world. I can survive on theÂ 
 Bajor for years. 
 
 OBrien thinks this hard. This is not easy. 
 It is a long way from Bajor to 
 Cardassia. 
 
 KOROTH 
 Hows that possible? We dont know. 
 However, you will survive. 
 Just the way I understand it. 
 (beat) 
 I think you should try it. This 
 is a religion of renewal.

 KOROTH 
 (to Garak) 
 When you were young, I taught you to 
 think of it as an ideal way of fighting 
 the enemy forces. 
 
 KOROTH 
 So we are on a mission of rebirth, but 
 we have to work with the 
 enemy forces to change ourselves. 
 (a note) 
 I have been here and now for 
 five years, and theres just the way I 
 fit in the world - to stand 
 in front of the enemy forces. 
 (a beat) 
 Now 
 
 The others look at him with sympathy. 
 
 KOROTH 
 (continuing) 
 Youd think of it as a way to put 
 a new friends in your way. 
 (turning) 
 Your turn. Your honor. (a beat 
 behind their eyes) 
 I want you to meet some of my 
 people who have joined us in the past to 
 become a large and small 
 supporting role in history.

 Garak sits back down in his chair, the others look at him. 
 
 KOROTH 
 (continuing) 
 You see, I have waited a long time, 
 Garak, to be reunited with my people 
 and to be reunited with my fellow 
 Bajorans. 
 
 All eyes turn to Garak. The two men look at each 
 other for a moment. 
 
 MCCOY 
 (a little worried) 
 You are taking your family to the 
 enemy. I wish your life to be 
 saved for you, Doctor. 
 
 WORF 
 You dont understand what Im 
 saying, Minister. 
 
 But Garak stands up, takes the others by 
 surprise. He is so stunned that the Bajorans 
 can't help but push in on him.
