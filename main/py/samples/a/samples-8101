======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 to
 SISKO 
 I will ask if there are any 
 other charges. 
 
 QUARK 
 (shakes his head) 
 I have already tried that, but they 
 cant be combined. 
 
 Sisko walks up to the accused man. 
 
 DEEP SPACE "Defiant" - REV. 10/04/94 - ACT ONE 12.

 SISKO 
 (to Odo) 
 I need your cooperation. If you 
 dont respond on your first 
 attempt, you are simply not about to get 
 arrested - if that is your case, I want a 
 quiet man in Ops. 
 
 Odo looks at Kira with the unruffled response. 
 
 QUARK 
 This is not a case of "I amlady 
 Night." 
 
 Odo considers for a beat, then 
 
 ODO 
 I understand - but if this case 
 has gone to my ship 
 and its taken me a while to 
 rebuild it, and to think Im lucky 
 Id rather be dead than live alone 
 alone in the Gamma Quadrant 
 with those three people I serve. 
 But if what you suspected was a 
 misunderstanding I apologize. But I think 
 your loyalty oath is broken. 
 
 QUARK 
 I apologize for me. You have been 
 asking me to try some 
 additional hand-on 
 service. 
 
 ODO 
 (reacts) 
 Your Prime has expired 
 
 QUARK 
 (deadly) 
 A security lapse! Im sorry about that, 
 Constable. It must have been a 
 rough six years. 
 
 ODO 
 I wouldnt put it like an 
 exaggeration to say that. 
 During my three 
 years on Voyager I have never 
 fallen in love, and I suspect its 
 the latest version of that. 
 
 Odo gives him a bemused look, then Quark storms off. 
 
 DEEP SPACE "Defiant" - REV. 10/06/94 - ACT ONE 13.

 SISKO 
 (a warning) 
 Thats some kind of a trap. 
 (open up the case) 
 Think carefully. I know 
 if theres some way to the "explorer 
 I know" you had to come 
 with me. I want a complete report 
 that way. But I want to know 
 what you have got. All of it. 
 
 QUARK 
 Is that a demand? 
 
 ODO 
 Not one. Im just going to get 
 Quark out of here, if that 
 is the title I prefer. 
 
 QUARK 
 Dont be ridiculous. I had 
 twelve people running through the 
 ship. 
 
 Dax comes next to the man. 
 
 QUARK 
 (beaming) 
 Go on. Tell people 
 they dont want to know the 
 answer. Thats the title they 
 use. 
 
 ODO 
 You are right. 
 
 Odo smiles as if in agreement with his work. 
 
 QUARK 
 It sounds simpler than 
 that. Its been about an 
 hour. 
 
 
 DEEP SPACE "Defiant" - 10/06/94 - ACT ONE 14.

 DAX 
 It is. 
 
 Quark moves forward and Daxs eyes meet 
 with him. 
 
 QUARK 
 I accept. 
 
 Quark nods, and when they close eye, the 
 two of them EXIT into the monitor. 
 
 QUARK 
 Good night, Major. 
 (turning to Odo) 
 As soon as you think of 
 it, I want a full report made 
 as soon as I see you at duty. 
 
 Odo smiles and goes back to work.

10 INTERIOR AMBASSADOR QUARTERS - PICARD (OPTICAL ) 
 
 The guest quarters are a small, modest, one-room 
 room. A desk sits in front of it. A simple one- 
 room. The doorways and doors CLOSE.
