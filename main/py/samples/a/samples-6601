======== SAMPLE 1 ========
You-fleet team? 
NEELIX Why else would I be the one giving you a hard time, 
Captain? 
PICARD And I need a ship capable of replicating its warp signature. 
PICARD And your new project? 
PICARD So far, it hasnt been successful. 
PICARD But it has. 
JANEWAY Congratulations, Captain. May I ask the question that everyone likes to ask 
you about yourself? 
PICARD Yes. 
JANEWAY Let us find it, shall we? 
PICARD I cant. 
PICARD The problem is, theres nothing. 
JANEWAY Dont tell me, Captain. 
PICARD The problem is. There are no stars in the 
planets rotation or suns core. 
JANEWAY That problem has been solved. 
JANEWAY The problem has been corrected. Mister Kim, if something is 
wrong, let me ask you. 
KIM I have checked out all the protocols. The problem 
was nobody contacted with priority one. 
JANEWAY I apologise. I want everyone to return to the ship and look 
for a reason to change you mind. 
PICARD I think I will apologize. I know this was Starfleets 
all 
JANEWAY I know. Im sorry, Neelix, but I have a duty to ask. 
KIM He was on his way to find the core when he jerked as though on an 
exlegatory panel. 
PARIS (OC) Bridge to Picard. 
JANEWAY Go ahead. 
PARIS (OC) Can you hear me? 
JANEWAY Did you make my sound? 
PARIS (OC) I swear its still not a malfunction. Let me guess. 
JANEWAY The helms not responding. 
PARIS (OC) I’m telling you, if things never went well, let’s get out of there 
but we’d stay, the core’ll never let it go. 
JANEWAY I’m telling you, it’ll let me go. 
PARIS (OC) Hold on, Captain’s not gonna let you have this. 
 
(Mess Hall) 
 
NEELIX Let’s see. Why did he put his arms around me? 
TUVOK I’m not certain you’re telling that.’NEELIX Let’s look. We’ll see if we’ll ever see the core. 
JANEWAY Well, we’ll keep checking. 
 
(Sickbay) 
 
PARIS I’m not detecting any parasites or life forms. 
TORRES That’s too bad. It’s only a question of which’s exactly right. Any tests we’ll ask, its not a biological thing. Its an anomaly. You’ll never look at those test results. You’ll just try it on yourself. No matter how weird it was, I’m sure you’ll think twice about this. 
PARIS That’s not necessary. I’ll let you go. The medical simulation is running all night. 
TORRES And if I’m telling you about this the test was a disaster. You’ll have to be sorry. 
PARIS Well, if you’ll say so. 
JANEWAY No. 
PARIS Nothing. 
TORRES I’m sorry. I’m sorry. This is a malfunction. 
TORRES No fault. It’s my fault. I’m not even paying much attention to it. He’s a bad guy. 
 
(Corridor) 
 
JANEWAY I’m afraid the core is…well, I’m not sure. There’s just one way to find a way to 
trap something’s wrong. Hang on. You’ll be the only one with a pulse of blood, 
because all this plasma will only protect the organism. You’ll also need that replenishment. 
TORRES And the best one, if there’s really that’s what I’m saying. 
JANEWAY That’s why I’m here. What’s wrong? 
TORRES That’s why everyone has to step off the plasma drain. Without proper bio-ponoxys. (
