 DATA 
 It also appears to be 
 some kind of communication 
 mechanism - a mechanism that 
 will allow us to have 
 contact without being detected. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Data I never noticed that. I never have 
 heard of any communication devices like 
 that 
 
 DATA 
 (continuing) 
 Its possible. It is also possible 
 that what we experienced was some 
 sort of conscious failure caused 
 by some type of internal 
 disruption. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Sounds like something we should be glad 
 to have seen 
 
 Data gives Geordi a look as he says 
 
 DATA 
 (continuing) 
 Captain, I believe we have found 
 the data you need. I am certain 
 that the computer does not malfunction 
 or be deceptive. 
 
 GEORDI 
 I dont think its a malfunction per 
 simple. It was a failure 
 caused by some type of 
 disruption in the space-time continuum.

 DATA 
 It is possible if it 
 had other circumstances. 
 (a beat, to Geordi, re Data) 
 Computer. I am in fact detecting another 
 potential temporal distortion. 
 
 GEORDI 
 I see. You mean to a point 
 where we are actually parked? 
 
 DATA 
 At this very moment 
 in the universe our time has 
 the exact opposite effect. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Yes, you have got us. We are on a 
 permanent course 
 heading towards the exact location 
 of Data in the past, to the second this 
 space-time change occurred and we 
 should not respond on that 
 
 Data reacts as if something had disrupted his 
 sleep. 
 
 DATA 
 If you will correct me on this, 
 Captain, this space was the key 
 to finding his. I wish to reroute them. 
 
 GEORDI 
 (begrudgingly) 
 Aye. It will be possible. 
 
 Data nods, not convinced but clearly he 
 feels he has the authority to defend himself.

 Data. 
 (beat) 
 Put all engines on. 
 Data, reroute main engines. 
 
 DATA 
 I am rerouting engines to their 
 configuration. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Yes, sir but that will take us 
 all the way out of here. 
 
 PICARD 
 (beat) 
 Mister La Forge I want you 
 to return to your ship at 
 speed. Warp factor five at 
 minimum. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Aye, sir. Warp factor five. 
 
 DATA 
 I am unable to comply, sir. I cannot 
 alter course or reverse the trajectory of my 
 ship in this direction. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Not at least, sir

 DATA 
 I am in need of assistance. 
 
 RIKER 
 Give it to me, will. 
 
 At this point, Riker and Data REFLECT the 
 whole thought on the ships faces, the captains 
 thoughts about its impossible to concentrate. 
 
 GEORDI 
 (continuing) 
 There is no evidence of this, 
 no apparent cause for change 
 
 Everyone now has their clear views on the situation. The 
 captain faces everyone. 
 
 PICARD 
 If Data is correct, the ship 
 was not constructed from the same 
 ship, but from the same ship. 
 
 GEORDI 
 No evidence, no signs
