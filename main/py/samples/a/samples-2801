 Picard is feeling strange at the fact that 
 he sees the same people twice. However, 
 since he has seen them, he understands it must 
 be a vision - the mind and the heart alike all the same. 
 
 PICARD 
 Is there a memory loss? 
 
 KIRK 
 Memory loss, sir. I am not going to touch that 
 part of myself I just 
 see 
 
 Picard is not amused.

 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 Your explanation is that of 
 the loss of your memory 
 
 KIRK 
 Yes, very well. 
 
 Picard stands up and moves toward the turbolift. 
 
 KIRK 
 Im sorry, Captain, but the 
 questions I asked were only 
 and a minor. 
 
 Picard looks back to see if he sees a connection at the 
 transceiver.

 PICARD 
 Your transceiver? 
 
 KIRK 
 No, no, no, no. It was removed in an 
 emergency ward. We had to 
 try to set it back on 
 the pad. 
 
 PICARD 
 Major. 
 
 KIRK 
 No, no, no. 
 
 Picard smiles. Hes been waiting for it.

5 INTERIOR TRANSPORTER ROOM 
 
 Picard is behind the deck, as Picard looks back, and 
 KIRK and COMMANDER stand listening to KIRK. The Transporter Room is 
 already a hundred and fifty degrees in front of 
 him. 
 
 KIRK 
 Captain, you are speaking 
 on the station. 
 
 KIRK 
 (dismissive) 
 You are right. I wasnt saying 
 any. 
 
 KIRK 
 (surprising) 
 The Transporter Room is a reserve 
 room on the station. Its not 
 my mission, sir. 
 
 Picard sees. Looks up. 
 
 KIRK 
 You havent noticed. 
 
 K COMMANDER 
 I need to see you immediately, 
 sir, and I want to say that theres 
 no reason no there will be any 
 reason to get you there. 
 
 Picard gives Kuk pause as he looks at him, and 
 then back to Transporter Room Two. Kok takes a look at Picard, then 
 reluctantly turns to Picard. 
 
 KOK 
 Captain, theres a 
 very strange coincidence on the 
 Transporter Room.

 Captain 
 
 Picard realizes there is no one watching, and moves to 
 the Transporter Unit to see 
 him. 
 
6 INTERIOR TRANSPORTER ROOM 
 
 Picard is already there. He and KUDAKA are on the 
 platform. Both are holding a PADD. They are 
 dressed identically. The transporter room door to 
 Transporter Room Two opens, and he and KUDAKA ENTER. They 
 look like they know each other by reputation.

 Picard nods. 
 
 KUDAKA 
 The Transporter Room takes a very 
 precaution not to be followed by anyone in transporter 
 room. It includes Major 
 
 Picard steps toward the Transporter Room. 
 
 PICARD 
 Captain, you are a very 
 curious transporter room 
 captain. 
 
 KUDAKA 
 And your room is cramped. 
 
 Picard doesnt know. 
 
 KUDAKA 
 Not that a Klingon captain had transporter 
 room crew. When someone requests it, 
 you are just the captain
