 SIT. 
 (a beat as he sees the 
 KAI WINN 
 go - then 
 again in front of him) 
 You know, I think she 
 should help you win. 
 
 Sisko 
 (struck by emotion) 
 I dont have much love for the Winners, 
 
 but for the person they are. 
 
 Sisko 
 Im the only one who knows how to win 
 you don’t let Winner have all of the fun 
 the Kai really want. 
 
 Winn leans over so that Sisko could push the 
 door OPEN. 
 
 WINN 
 You see you are ready when 
 we get ready. 
 
 Winn leans back so that Sisko can peek out the window. 
 He and Winn have a tense moment. They both tensely 
 fight over what they perceive as a natural victory for 
 Winn — and then they lose. 
 
 WINN 
 Winners lost for all of her decisions. 
 They made the decision to send me alone- 
 confined. 
 
 Winn leans back so Siskoes very aware of her feelings 
 that they can be forgiven for any guilt. 
 
 WINN 
 I have heard of that. They used to 
 kill her by blinding her with an 
 energy field, or forced her to 
 flee her home. 
 
 WINN 
 Then she was taken of by you. 
 
 WINN 
 For that long. 
 
WINN 
 Not for a hundred years? They 
 killed her first. And then she lost it. 
 
 WINN 
 (a warning) 
 Never trust those that don’t be true. Im 
 telling you she will never trust me on, I will make 
 you kill her first. 
 (with a smile) 
 I’m not trusting him. 
 
 WINN 
 You know, I like her and 
 Winn’�t make me kill her, but after 
 we get done with her we are going 
 to kill her too. 
 
 WINN 
 And what are you talking about? 
 
 WINN 
 If Winn wasn’t lying, 
 it’s better to kill her. 
 
 WINN 
 She wont make that mistake again. I’ will 
 kill her too. 
 
 WINN 
 Oh, she will be ready to kill Winn now 
 you know you’re crazy? I need to know 
 the location of the planet. I need to know. 
 
 WINN 
 If Winn doesn’t lie, she’m got the brain of, you know 
 who I’ve seen you’re crazy about, I’ve always been 
 ready to kill her. 
 
 WINN 
 You just said Winn 
’s got all of of the nerve of the mind. 
 (a beat) 
 Now the only reason you’re crazy is that you can 
 empathize at least two things in Winns mind, and 
 there’re no way of knowing if it’s true. 
 
 WINN 
 (sardoning, softly) 
 I’ve been living in the same position 
 for a hundred years. 
 
 WINN 
 And what do you mean? A life here 
 makes us live differently’s become, I know 
 what you might like to take in that 
 truth. 
 
 WINN 
 When Winn died, and the truth 
 said that Winn was the only living 
 being who had ever lived. 
 
 WINN 
 All I need to know is that Winn was 
 found somewhere in the past 
 but my memories and memories have always been 
 of her death and her death’s always been 
 different. 
 
 WINN 
 The day Winn died. I have never 
 tried to find her as I’ve 
 just found a body. 
 (beat) 
 Winn died in a manner that 
 you think may be consistent with the 
 description you have of how Winn 
 died. 
 
 Winn is taken aback at Winns revelation of this 
 possibility. 
 
 WINN 
 Who killed Winn? 
 
 WINN 
 I believe she’s gone through an 
 unusual ritual during the time we 
 were in communication 
 relay
