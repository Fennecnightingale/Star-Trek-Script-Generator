 DATA 
 I have reviewed historical, geographical 
 historical and literary surveys of several 
 thousand worlds and encountered 
 no intelligent life on them. 
 
 It is a fact they 
 
 (turning to Picard) 
 However some may have 
 some. I cannot deny the 
 possibility of a 
 "warrior culture." 
 Although I cant deny the 
 possibility, if I am right, 
 I cannot turn it down. Neither I nor 
 anyone are here. 
 
 Picard shakes his head in amazement and 
 pats it on the back. Off Picards 
 expression. 
 
 FADE OUT.

 FADE IN 
 
4 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE and PICARD (OPTICAL) 
 
 On course. 
 
5 INTERIOR CARGO BAY 
 
 The room is almost empty. The 
 airlock is shut. 
 
 PICARD (O.S.) 
 Excuse me. 
 
 Beverly ENTERS. She crosses to the port. 
 
6 INTERIOR CARGO BAY 
 
 Beverly approaches the airlock leading to 
 the sarcophagus. 
 
 BEVERLY (V.O.) 
 Could you enter the sarcophagus? 
 
 PICARD 
 No. 
 
 Beverly crosses to the sarcophagus and 
 reaches around it on the wall monitor. 
 
 She enters the sarcophagus. The casing has been 
 opened inside. 
 
 PICARD 
 (into com) 
 It says here that 
 theres no external casing 
 of the sarcophagus has been 
 removed. 
 
 Beverly scans the sarcophagus with 
 a medical scanner. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 What are you looking at? 
 
 Theres no obvious design or configuration 
 
 which indicates the presence of the sarcophagus 
 inside. 
 
 PICARD 
 It appears to be built into 
 a humanoid skeleton. 
 
 She sets the sarcophagus back inside. Theres 
 no atmosphere at all. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 (nods) 
 This could be a sarcophagus. 
 
 She scans the sarcophagus closely, looking 
 inside is anything but safe. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 There is enough residual bio-patterns 
 in the sarcophagus for the 
 transport of a few alien objects. It 
 could indicate an organic material 
 inside. 
 
 This leaves Picard in puzzlement. 
 
 PICARD 
 How could an artificial casing like 
 that could have been 
 removed? 
 
 Beverly crosses to a sarcophagus and starts to scan it, 
 with a medical scanner. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 (re sarcophagus) 
 It looks like this works both 
 sides of the alien space. 
 
 PICARD 
 (smiling) 
 Which would suggest the 
 atmosphere inside had been 
 sterilized. 
 (a beat) 
 The question is, how do we find 
 out someone did this? 
 
 BEVERLY 
 (off scanner) 
 Theres an organic trace 
 of a human female in the 
 rock strata system.

5 CONTINUED 
 
 A beat. Beverly pauses. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 You dont look that far 
 from the surface. How is it here,? 
 
 PICARD 
 I dont know. The biospectral radiation 
 pattern does indicate what is 
 in the rocks. 
 We cant isolate 
 it. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 Will theres any danger for us 
 to have to use? 
 
 DATA 
 There can be very. 
 
 She considers.

 Theres no need to be specific.
