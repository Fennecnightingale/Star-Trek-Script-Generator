 And I will tell you one thing I love 
 your food better. 
 
 BEVERLY 
 Im tired and I want to be 
 tired of watching that baby 
 scream. 
 
 She picks up a hypospray and gives him a hypospray 
 to put his arm. 
 
 BEVERLY (contd) 
 Im twenty-six years old and I have 
 a fever, but I seem to be 
 enjoying the pain.

 He gives her a hypospray, then heads to the door. 
 Beverly looks unhappy with him, picks up 
 the hypospray 
 
 BEVERLY 
 We are twenty-five years from 
 here. If you want to 
 stay there you are going to have 
 to talk me to someone 
 with a doctor first. 
 
 She grabs a round hypospray and puts together a mild 
 sedative. 
 
 BEVERLY (contd) 
 Tell me someone was very 
 generous and very cruel at 
 a celebration for such a fetid life. 
 But someone got sick 
 of it and died because 
 you cared. Some fights 
 broke out among the crew. 
 
 And as Beverly examines the deadly blow on his arm

 RIKER, WORF, and GEORDI are among a row of spectators as 
 Beverly looks on with concern and tries to calm 
 a little. Geordi helps first with a 
 usually lump of grass, then 
 leans in to help with one, but his attention is 
 already elsewhere, probing the ground for some 
 emergency lights. 
 
 RIKER 
 We are all going to need some 
 blankets and the flairs 
 running. I wonder what kind 
 of blanket this is going to 
 be. 
 
 WORF 
 Is that a request or have 
 you already been given one? 
 
 Picard looks at the others, scratching his neck, 
 as Worf rubs a nearby matador on the side of his head with the 
 deadly cut. 
 
 WORF 
 What is that? What? 
 
 GEORDI 
 Thats just a guess. 
 
 Geordi feels uncomfortable, then looks up at Riker, 
 his mind working intently. 
 
 GEORDI 
 (continuing) 
 Geordi have you been down here for 
 an awfully long time? 
 
 RIKER 
 About fifteen years my 
 cell. 
 
 Off Worfs look we -

 WORF 
 I see. Can you believe 
 that? 
 
 GEORDI 
 Maybe this thing will convince 
 me the need for my medical 
 skills. 
 
 The group exchange looks. 
 
 WORF 
 And I doubt this will be 
 necessary for a long 
 discussion. 
 
 GEORDI 
 Worf I think I can get through to 
 Riker to Starfleet Medical 
 and let him come up to 
 know a special about his 
 treatment. 
 
 WORF 
 No argument here. 
 
 GEORDI 
 And I suspect we will find this 
 useful. 
 
 A beat to silence. Then for a beat 
 
 GEORDI 
 Worf I will show you where to 
 continue repairs on 
 Geordi. 
 
 But Worf doesnt move. And so goes between Geordi and 
 Beverly, finally consulting them on something. 
 
 WORF 
 Geordi I believe the 
 discussion will begin at 
 fifteen hours tonight. (to Riker) 
 Please escort the guest 
 quarters. 
 
 RIKER 
 Okay but Im afraid I dont see
