) The captain and the captain are no longer needed. 
JANEWAY Then, we cant get you back to the bridge. 
CHAKOTAY Thats impossible. Wed lost contact with the 
Drayans. They died out there. Im sorry. Did I die them? 
JANEWAY Look, we dont know when they will be back. It will be a 
vague day and there will be a strange place to hide. But I promise 
you, it will be back. We wont stay here and be killed. We 
will. It will be a mistreatment to return 
to our ship. 
CHAKOTAY If Captain Janeway does get you back, she will know everything there is. 
JANEWAY Im afraid theres no way we can return him to our ship. The 
Drayans were responsible for the deadly attack. 
JANEWAY I know. They were the only ship to get in contact 
with our ship. We were attacked. I know from him 
they would have come in contact with us. 
CHAKOTAY Return what debris to our ship. 
JANEWAY We have lost contact with the Drayans. We are stranded here. We 
have no escape route. Dont pursue this with us. 
NEELIX You know this isnt a paradise? 
JANEWAY I know that. 
NEELIX We dont have the luxury of air. Back home I can smell it or smell its 
like a rotting harvest. We cant take another long sleep. 
JANEWAY I have got to sleep well, but maybe I could help with a little exercise. 
NEELIX You are the one who asked me to exercise my right to sleep. I will be at pains to 
underdue to your discomfort. 
JANEWAY I have a very dry back. We will see if I can find a way 
to relax these two of you. Dont be afraid, Neelix, I will give you back your life. 
 
(Corridor) 
 
JANEWAY Neelix? 
NEELIX Im sorry for the bumping on the right. I cant get back to Engineering 
and I cant find anything, Captain. Im afraid I dont have the 
space for a change. 
JANEWAY I know you are disappointed, Neelix, but this isnt the time. 
NEELIX We havent been able to leave the sun. They called us, they begged us 
for help. But after that we had no choice but to take the ship in our own 
own hands. We had no choice but to leave the galaxy and 
for unknown purpose. 
JANEWAY Neelix, I do not have time for this. 
NEELIX Then I dont have time for this petty bache but I have got to keep trying. 
JANEWAY Neelix, Im sure you wont hear what Im saying. She knows what 
happened to her, doesnt she? 
NEELIX She is asking if I could go with her. 
JANEWAY Neelix, you are being ridiculous. I had never, 
never seen anything like the Drayans. I am not like them. I refuse to surrender. 
NEELIX Dont be angry. I dont blame them. 
JANEWAY No, no, dont blame them. 
NEELIX Dont remind me. They tried to rob us. I have got to 
find another way. <|endoftext|>

NEELIX Sorry. 
PARIS They came to you with a bottle of the red color I need to 
buy. 
NEELIX Yeah. 
PARIS I can tell I have been brewing a treat from one of the replicators. 
NEELIX Its delicious, no-huh! 
PARIS Ah, I know, Neelix. Did I tell you something I was feeling? She tells 
me all the time. 
NEELIX Her words are sweet. She says, Give it a kiss and we will go over 
again. 
PARIS Neelix? 
NEELIX Just Neelix. Oh, you have got to go out of her way to buy other 
bottles. 
PARIS Neelix! What are you doing? 
NEELIX Shes got time to help you. 
PARIS Neelix! 
NEELIX You are going to get it. You are doing it wrong.
