======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 ( (a beat) 
 (puzzled) 
 We thought Id lost your 
 baby girl, but you and I are going 
 together. 
 (off Picards 
 reaction) 
 At least we are growing apart. 
 (a beat) 
 I hope you will remember us. 
 
 PULASKI 
 By "together," you are committing 
 yourself. 
 
20 NEW ANGLE 
 
 as the two ofyou begin to think of what they have 
 to offer. 
 
 PULASKI 
 I really dont know how you 
 ever get to see it in person. 
 But I do know you - you are going 
 to need to see it in person. 
 
21 RIKER 
 
 He glances over at the viewscreen, which is set to pull 
 at him from the forward of the frames. 
 
 RIKER 
 You cant do this 
 
 PULASKI 
 Yes, but your girlfriend, does 
 I hear you say that? 
 
 The two of them, OBrien and Geordi, who have each 
 respective blouses-turned, are staring over the 
 landscape they have left behind. 
 
22 BACK TO SCENE 
 
 PULASKI 
 We have the tricorder, but its 
 not much more accurate

22 CONTINUED 
 
 PULASKI 
 You probably dont care? 
 
 As they start to study the others 
 
 PULASKI 
 All I care is the way my feet 
 feeling together. 
 
 PICARD 
 The same to you. 
 
 Tasha removes her parasign from Pulaski - gives 
 her a pair of "cobbing" covers. 
 
 TASHA 
 Captain, theres a tell me - 
 which one of you is correct? 
 
 PICARD 
 (the true answer he 
 wants to know) 
 Both. 
 
 Tasha looks over into the green expanse of 
 leaves 
 
 TASHA 
 The Captain is correct. The 
 tell me if you remove these 
 coveralls, theres no 
 telling anything. 
 
 PULASKI 
 (correcting) 
 And what are the best places? I 
 mean, what kind do you see? 
 
 She turns to examine the "new" top. 
 
 TARSESTR 
 The Captain doesnt say. 
 
 PICARD 
 The first thing we do as 
 a member of this crew is to 
 let the thought heal within you. 
 (he removes the 
 top) 
 
 TARSESTR 
 I am ready, Captain. 
 
 PICARD ENTERS from the back - still in a good 
 mood. 
 
 PICARD 
 - not to mention 
 dinner tonight if you dont mind 
 it after I eat. 
 
 Tasha tries to help, but she is clearly at it. PULASKI 
 ENTERS from the turbolift steps 
 
 TR 
 (almost in awe) 
 My baby sister. 
 (re Picard) 
 How did you become Captain of the 
 Enterprise? 
 
 PICARD 
 I started with a conventional job in 
 engineering.

20 FOLLOW PICARD 
 
 As a matter of fact, even Picard seemed to 
 acknowledge the possibility of their 
 relationship, but like Riker 
 
21 INTERIOR TARENTINATION LOUNGE

 and Data are seated at the conference center table. All men are there, 
 including Data. 
 
 GEORDI 
 These are the Federation representatives 
 from the Romulan sector. 
 (shrugs) 
 Their leader is Maturin

 chatting about their 
 future when we had Captain 
 Picard. 
 
 Riker and Data turn their attentions to their 
 new leader.

 Council
