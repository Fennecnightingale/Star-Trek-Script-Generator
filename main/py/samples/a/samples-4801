======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 
. 
 
 I am not sure how 
 I would put this one 
 off. 
 
 KASIDY 
 Well, I guess we will have to 
 make an announcement tomorrow. Will you 
 find out when the time arrives 
 KASIDY 
 If this makes you uncomfortable 
 you could write a 
 letter to Worf, of course. 
 
 SISKO 
 Is there a problem? 
 
 KASIDY 
 Worf is my son. He has a 
 loving and strong personality. And 
 he has a healthy, happy 
 spirit to go with.

 SISKO 
 We have to find out if he can 
 figure out what hes going to do. 
 
 KASIDY 
 That depends on how long he can 
 get. It has to be 
 fast - he couldnt possibly be expected to 
 change a thing. 
 
 DAX 
 But hes losing another word. 
 
 KASIDY 
 Another seven, maybe? 
 
 DAX 
 (dry) 
 Or maybe not. 
 
 DAX 
 Worf? 
 
 WORF 
 Its my duty. 
 
 DAX 
 I dont mean to sound rude, but 
 we have to be quick - 
 
 WORF 
 He will be back shortly. 
 
 DAX 
 He wants to get himself right 
 out of there before 
 he gets himself in any worse situations. 
 
 KASIDY 
 I know Worf, too. 
 
 DAX 
 Okay, Dad, tell us. 
 
 KASIDY 
 How long will it be before you 
 can call for that? 
 
 DAX 
 I just thought Id get used to the idea 
 I have. 
 
 KASIDY 
 We are already here. 
 
 DAX 
 Its a good idea. Now let me get a 
 little more busy. 
 
 KASIDY 
 I will have as much help as you 
 can on the way.

 DAX 
 (hard) 
 Theres a great deal of work 
 to be done. And you have 
 to be sure you are on the 
 right foot. 
 
 KASIDY 
 No. Its going to be one of the 
 first time on a Starfleet station. Kor. The Deep 
 Space Nine. 
 
 DAX 
 Wheres that going to help? You 
 already know the assignment. 
 
 KASIDY 
 I thought the first. But 
 Worf needs to concentrate on something 
 else. He has to think. 
 
 DAX 
 Worf, I can get used to your 
 touch on him. 
 
 KASIDY 
 Thats the only thing I cant 
 do. For a moment, I was going to let 
 you push him on your own. 
 
 DAX 
 (distracted) 
 Really? 
 
 KASIDY 
 Im trying. 
 
 DAX 
 But that wasnt easy. 
 
 KASIDY 
 But it was. 
 
 DAX 
 How long? 
 
 KASIDY 
 Not yet to get used to these 
 situations. I am going to 
 have to study the situation 
 myself, father. 
 
 DAX 
 Is that going to sound a little 
 foolish? 
 
 KASIDY 
 It depends upon my research 
 protostor. 
 
 DAX 
 It couldnt even get out 
 there to help repair anything 
 that doesnt require your 
 expertise. 
 
 KASIDY 
 You have a different opinion 
 than I do. 
 
 DAX 
 You could get used to it. Its a 
 simple procedure. 
 
 Kasidy frowns. 
 
 KASIDY 
 You have made your point, dont cry. 
 
 DAX
