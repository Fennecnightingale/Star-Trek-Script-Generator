 PICARD COM VOICE 
 Captain, I have the Enterprise 
 to pursue the attack 
 of the Klingon vessel. We are ready 
 to return and rendezvous with the 
 cruiser. 
 
 A look from the Klingon 
 
 PICARD 
 Im well aware of that, Lieutenant. 
 However, I want the Enterprise 
 to continue to 
 be under my jurisdiction - 
 to escort this captured 
 vessel. 
 
 There is a moment's these people are standing 
 a little off. They are very tense. 
 
 RIKER 
 Dont worry. We must get back 
 to Worf before we lose 
 the Lakota. 
 
 Riker is too stunned to argue a word. 
 
 PICARD 
 Lieutenant Worf. Your 
 reply might be a 
 mistake, Counselor. 
 
 Worf nods at a nod and heads for the door. 
 
 RIKER 
 Im sorry. 
 
 Riker turns back at the Klingon 
 
 RIKER 
 Dont worry, Lieutenant. I think you might have 
 enough of yourself. Arent you too 
 worried? Im fine.

 RIKER 
 I dont understand it. You 
 know a lot about me. Just 
 look - its like this. Theres 
 something down there. Theres 
 nothing. 
 
 KOL 
 (reacting to his console) 
 It looks like someones 
 just taken into account. 
 
 PICARD COM VOICE 
 A transporter could appear 
 anywhere. 
 
 KOL 
 (an understatement) 
 Youd have better go with it. 
 
 RIKER 
 (scoical) 
 Whatever this is, it has a 
 purpose. 
 
 RIKER 
 I didnt mean any of us even spoke 
 it. 
 
 KOL 
 You, sir? 
 
 RIKER 
 (an understatement) 
 Theres only one way to find 
 out. 
 
 RIKER 
 We will look, Commander. 
 
 RIKER 
 (with reluctance) 
 I suggest you do so. 
 
 But Riker isnt about to back out of the 
 turbolift. He heads for the back.
