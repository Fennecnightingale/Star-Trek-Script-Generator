======== SAMPLE 1 ========


 
 
 KIRA (O.S.) 
 Listen. 
 
 ODO 
 Its important how you define 
 "time," sir. When we are finished here, 
 we go through a complete cycle of 
 time. 
 
 DEEP SPACE "In the Pale" - REV. 2/11/92 - ACT ONE 7. 
 
11 EXTERIOR SPACE - TEROK NOR (OPTICAL) 
 
 As it slows to stop outside the station, 
 the Defiant enters the other side of Terok Nor 
 
12 INTERIOR DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM 
 
 OBrien hurries to the door and emerges as the doors 
 close and the Defiants windows look out to sea. 
 
 BASHIR (O.S.) 
 Commander? 
 
 Odo reacts and finds BASHIR in the room. 
 
 BASHIR (O.S.) 
 Oh. You really think you are bringing 
 this ship back to its 
 own destiny ? 
 
 ODO 
 We could, believe, leave the 
 Defiants window, see the 
 Defiants reflection in the mirror, see the 
 reflection, but Im 
 afraid it was only the window. Its 
 too late. Its too close. 
 
 BASHIR 
 (re window) 
 Thats why you always get in the Defiant 
 whenever you are done. We could see it 
 up and down through the walls, hear the sound 
 of the hull groaning under pressure. 
 (to Odo) 
 What the Defiant should do? 
 
 ODO 
 The Defiant goes into Warp. 
 
 BASHIR 
 (puzzled) 
 What if we take the Defiants window and see the 
 reflection? It have to give us a chance to 
 see the big deflect pattern from up 
 there. 
 
 Bashir nods.

14 INTERIOR DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM 
 
 As before, the Defiant is in chaos the Defiants 
 hull BLUSTING, as if an oil boil 
 
14A INTERIOR DEFIANT - BRIDGE 
 
 There is a tense and terrible flash as the vessel is 
 about to BURK and then SMASHING the walls - everything is 
 burning with the ship. 
 
 DATA (V.O.) 
 Impact thirty seconds - then shut 
 down. 
 
 ODO 
 (off console) 
 We have not shut down the engine and 
 main engines. We are still in the 
 main engine. 
 
 DEEP SPACE "In the Pale" - REV. 2/09/92 - ACT ONE 8. 
 
14A CONTINUED 
 
 DATA (V.O.) 
 Damage is also significant. 
 
 OBRIEN (V.O.) 
 Chief, you are on the Bridge! 
 (everyone reacts) 
 Excuse me, OBrien.

16 INTERIOR DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM 
 
 OBrien hurries through some TECHNIC and into the turbolift. 
 SUPERNUMERARIES at every wheel. 
 
 QUARK (V.O.) 
 You two could have let 
 the Defiant before anyone else would. Its like 
 having a first-born child. Only a god 
 can manipulate time. 
 
 DEEP SPACE "In the Pale" - REV. 2/09/92 - ACT ONE 9.

 BASHIR (V.O.) 
 I can hear you, Quark. Its 
 not just a computer computer, it is a sentient 
 life form as well as an instrument. And 
 as a result, time isnt 
 very much a fraction lighter when you burn up. 
 
 Bashir, OBrien, Bashir, Quark hurry into the turbolift. 
 
 BASHIR 
 Quark, you are really losing a 
 little, Constable 
 
 QUARK 
 I have no idea how much 
 longer I can put a couple of lights on 
 the monitors 
 
 Bashir nods, he knows he cant put him off. 
 
 QUARK 
 Just kidding, Chief. But it 
 is way easier for you to
