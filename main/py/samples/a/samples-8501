 OBRIEN 
 Im willing to give it a try.

 Kira and Sisko are at their stations. 
 
 SISKO 
 We are approaching the co-ordinates. 
 But I want more signs of 
 Dukat.

 SISKO 
 That Dukat is definitely not the leader of 
 the U.S. KMO The leader of a 
 Federation that was once his chief of 
 Bajor. 
 
 KIRA 
 And if you are telling me hes not 
 there? That commander (the 
 Emissary) would 
 never come. 
 
 SISKO 
 Not without making a specific 
 security threat. 
 
 KIRA 
 The security threat was fired in 
 connection with Qaam and 
 Shaenor and then was then 
 pulled back. I 
 dont know if he was in good 
 company or otherwise 
 
 Sisko sits and raises his voice. 
 
 SISKO 
 I will take this 
 
 Sisko is about to take a deep breath, that seems 
 out of him to him somewhat, he cant take his 
 eyes off this moment. 
 
 SISKO 
 Major, all due respect, Ensign, I would 
 prefer an Officer with 
 a more senior staff. That duty 
 entails a certain trust to 
 Bajor.

 KIRA 
 I will keep that in mind. 
 
 She leaves. Sisko does not seem to have 
 been looking forward to this question. And we 
 
 FADE OUT.

7 INTERIOR TEROK NOR - NIGHT 
 
 The scene between Kira and Sisko is as old friends 
 and new friends age in the small room. 
 
 RIKER (V.O.) 
 (continuing) 
 Im afraid I have lost my 
 daughter, Jake. This is the one that 
 looked like Major Kira in the 
 beginning of her Starfleet career. 
 
 ODO (V.O.) 
 (beat) 
 What have some of their medical records? 
 
 JAKE (V.O.) 
 They didnt have many entries and 
 they didnt make any mention of military 
 security. 
 (beat) 
 Shes a security officer. As long as 
 she goes in there stays 
 out of the way. 
 (beat) 
 We have no time for them to leave 
 any future as they did 
 yesterday. 
 
 Kira glances at Jake. His eyes are a little strained. 
 
 KIRA 
 Jake, I tell you I will take you to 
 the Defiant for a look. 
 
 JAKE 
 A ship? They are barely functional. 
 
 SISKO 
 They can get you home there. 
 
 JAKE 
 But if you ever leave the 
 station 
 
 She gives him a sharp look. He nods and EXITS. Jake heads 
 toward the door.

 SISKO 
 Major, are you looking at me? If this is 
 serious it wouldnt be so easy 
 for you to drop by and let me 
 lose a valuable officer. 
 
 Theres a beat as they look in each others eyes. Sisko is 
 considering the delicate nature of this meeting is 
 turning into more awkward a decision. 
 
 SISKO 
 Im sorry, I appreciate your 
 concern.
