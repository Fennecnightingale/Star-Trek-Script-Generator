, not just that. We 
 could be having a great time.

 DATA 
 Yes, Captain we do. 
 
 DATA 
 (continuing) 
 Unfortunately, we also have another 
 problem. 
 
 He looks over at Picard, reacts with mild surprise. 
 
 DATA 
 I am still doing my job for the 
 Maquis. 
 
 PICARD 
 You are not doing your job, 
 Mister Data. 
 
 DATA 
 I am attempting to complete 
 my research on chronocyclic 
 dynamics. It would be a 
 fascinating opportunity. 
 
 PICARD 
 The Maquis? 
 
 DATA 
 (nods seriously) 
 Our past ties were 
 substantial. 
 
 PICARD 
 Thats an understatement if I was 
 ever tempted to make. 
 
 DATA 
 Sir, it could have been 
 difficult for me to obtain 
 Captain Picard. Without 
 the opportunity of finding 
 Captain Picard, I would have 
 died. 
 
 PICARD 
 (surprised looks from 
 everyone) 
 You are just being modest. 
 
 DATA 
 (smiling) 
 Sir 
 
 A beat, then everyone starts to realize something. 
 
 PICARD 
 (to COM) 
 I will be right there. I think 
 there are just a few minutes 
 before Beverly Crusher. 
 (to Data) 
 We have another mission here. 
 We met at the Griffith restoration 
 
 Data and Picard together again.

 as Bashir ENTERS in the direction of OBRIEN. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 (to Bashir) 
 You are looking to enlist an 
 extra hand? 
 
 BASHIR 
 Negative. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Why? 
 
 BASHIR 
 It looks as if you are 
 just the new chief. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 It looks as though I have lost my 
 job. 
 (to Bashir) 
 Your career ends right here. 
 (a beat) 
 I know I have a few 
 friends for the Maquis. But dont 
 me - 
 
 BASHIR 
 No. Theres no reason I cant 
 stay. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 (a beat) 
 Goodbye. 
 
 BASHIR 
 (a beat) 
 But I enjoyed the experience and 
 my career 
 
 OBRIEN 
 You did have a good year, 
 Doctor. Time 
 (off Bashir, before 
 answering) 
 Yes, but you can see whats 
 on my mind. 
 
 BASHIR 
 (smiles, for the 
 first time) 
 For two years I thought I was just 
 being a mens room fawn. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 I didnt. Years. 
 
 BASHIR 
 Then you can relax. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 Theres nothing like a good 
 period to rejuvenate. 
 
 BASHIR 
 You are a part of my team, Doctor 
 
 OBRIEN 
 We do what we are doing exactly. 
 
 BASHIR 
 I still feel a part of 
 you, Doctor. 
 (with a beat) 
 Now you may be tired - 
 
 OBRIEN 
 (a beat) 
 But you know how I think the best 
 journey ended before I left. I think 
 I will give it a close look. 
 
 BASHIR 
 (smiles) 
 You are just going to let me 
 let you get through that 
 isolation? It will give you a 
 chance to end up someplace 
 youd just like to be 
 again. 
 
 OBRIEN 
 (reacts. 
 to the memory) 
 That way,
