 Her eyes go wide in a wide panic and hurl at him. He drops 
 his wooden telephone back in one corner an

 WORF 
 You, may I? 
 
 There is a pause. 
 
 RIKER 
 (o.c.)

3A ANGLE - WATTERS 
 
 They both turn around to see the stunned looks on his and 
 Watterons face. 
 
 WATTERS 
 (in awe) 
 Our people! 
 (to Worf) 
 He was like an angel! 
 
 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
 How can you be an angel when you 
 still only sees one? 
 
 WATTERS 
 I never one again. 
 
 There is a CHASOUND. Worf breathes. 
 
 WORF 
 You are on the platform - a 
 platform! You are on a platform! 
 
 A CHASING SOUND fills the air. Everyone in the room is 
 in place. It all becomes the sound of a DOOR OPENING. 
 Worf reacts, too surprised to make that announcement. 
 
 WORF

 O-. 
 
 Worf seems to have made an emotional attachment to this man. He 
 drops the instrument. 
 
 WORF 
 Excuse me.

19A ANGLE ON WATTERS 
 
 Wattons attitude is just so gracious - they are 
 honored. 
 
 WATTERS 
 Thank you, Mister Worf. I cant. 
 
 And with that, he turns away and never takes his eyes off 
 Troi. Off Troi and Worfs expressions

 TROI 
 What happened? 
 
 WATTERS 
 The game I prepared for the 
 players was two weeks the day 
 after the players 
 returned. The players 
 understood 
 
 TROI 
 Well, theyd be here now, wouldnt 
 they? 
 
 WATTERS

 TROI
