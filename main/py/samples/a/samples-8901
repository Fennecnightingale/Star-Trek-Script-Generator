 whos an intriguing character in his own voice.

 SISKO 
 Lieutenant, when my First Officer 
 dies, I dont intend to be the first 
 one to remember the two of you. 
 
 KIRA 
 I have no idea whos going 
 on around here some day. 
 
 That seems to impress everyone else a little. 
 
 SISKO 
 Not my First Officer 
 
 KIRA 
 Not him. 
 
 SISKO 
 Who you were when you 
 died two years ago? 
 
 KIRA 
 Do you remember when you were a child? 
 
 I never even knew a birthday. 
 
 And off Siskos reaction 
 
21 INTERIOR REPLIMAT (OPTICAL) 
 
 where several employees are queued out of the 
 blue area. Odo is working near the entrance to the 
 Observation Lounge, while the other employees watch 
 curiously. A beat as Sisko looks around.

22 ON SISKO 
 
 whos down the corridor, holding a cup 
 of tea. 
 
 SISKO 
 I dont know where you are, 
 and I have never met anyone who grew 
 old in my life. 
 (a beat) 
 Im not surprised. 
 
 He casts a cup on the door instead. 
 
 SISKO 
 I remember. 
 
 KIRA 
 You seem surprised. 
 
 SISKO 
 Surprise me. Sometimes when I tell 
 you something, I cant do it. 
 
 KIRA 
 Its called a miching trick. 
 
 SISKO 
 What does a Klingon boy feel about 
 his father? 
 
 DEEP SPACE "Progress" - 2/16/89 - ACT ONE 15. 
 
22 CONTINUED 
 
 DUKAT 
 (shakes his head) 
 He depends on his parents. 
 
23 NEW ANGLE 
 
 on Dukat and his father. 
 
 WORF 
 (protesting) 
 Theres a little difference. 
 
 KIRA 
 (smiles) 
 Just what? 
 (smiles) 
 I thought the Female had all 
 the same feelings about me. 
 
 DUKAT 
 He is a Klingon. 
 
 WORF 
 As a matter of fact, my father 
 comes from a Klingon. 
 
 DAX 
 There really is a difference. 
 
 KIRA 
 How does he feel about losing 
 his wife to a man like 
 yourself? 
 
 WORF 
 I wish he hadnt told you that 
 there werent real jobs for us 
 to do the same. 
 
 DAX 
 So does the Federation. 
 
 SISKO 
 Im sure they are different. 
 
 And off this moment, we 
 
 FADE OUT.

10 INTERIOR PROMENADE 
 
 A few KLINGONS are milling around the 
 station. They are almost ready to bring in 
 business. 
 
 The name of the dead male is 
 known around these people and they seem 
 to be preparing for this, whatever it is. 
 
 ODO 
 If this keeps up, the 
 Terokka will be able to 
 keep us in one day. 
 (beat) 
 Dont worry about that
