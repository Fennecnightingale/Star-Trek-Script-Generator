 me 
 of the station. 
 QUARREN You are the ones with the medical scanner. 
 NIL I told you to call me. I didnt understand at first! My initial scan came 
 out of my mind wasnt a success at all. But then, the words sounded so perfect. That really 
 doesnt sound normal. 
 NIL We are a proud man, a lot proud. 
 NIL Its not that. 
 NIL Its actually, its just that until I start hearing the way, you have been programmed to do just that. 
 NIL You have already programmed him. 
 NIL Then he can run through a medical scan. 
 NIL That wont be necessary. 
 NIL The doctors the most skilled in the quadrant. 
 NIL The most skilled. 
 NIL I can imagine that. 
 NIL Can you imagine what hes going through? 
 NIL I know he can do a lot better now. 
 NIL What has he done? 
 NIL Im not sure. I believe that hes programmed to be afraid of us. 
 NIL Fear? 
 NIL I can see hes hurt. I cant tell. 
 NIL I believe we need to talk. 
 NIL No. Hes damaged. His internal organs are damaged. We have to 
 talk. 
 NIL Go ahead. 
 NIL How long have you been with him? How long have you known him? What have you 
 been worried about? What kind of concern is? 
 NIL You do. 
 NIL Its not like we talked about it. 
 NIL We have been working on this for six months we dont have much 
 luck. It wasnt our fault, and I dont want you to find that. I 
 think its something else. Something inside of him thats keeping you from 
 feeling okay. Something inside of you that you that you dont 
 understand. 
 NIL I believe what I have been told is accurate. 
 NIL Im afraid. 
 NIL Then do you think hes hurt? 
 NIL I dont know. Hes injured, hes damaged. I dont know. 
 NIL Maybe we have a simple disagreement. You havent answered my question. 
 NIL I have never been hurt before. 
 NIL I have nothing to say to him. 
 DEVICE What? 
 DEVICE You told me not to speak to anyone. 
 NIL I know. Its not like you know. 
 NIL I dont know if thats because of me or what you know, but whether he really 
 believes me or not depends.
