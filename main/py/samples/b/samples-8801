 kill the bridge of the 
 Bomaar. 
 KIRA 
 (reacts to the sight) 
 Bomaar? 
 BOMAAR 
 Our Commander has said he believes 
 the Bomaar is attempting to establish 
 military presence in the Gamma Quadrant.

 KIRA 
 Thats a little odd, dont you think? 
 BOMAAR 
 (trying to be light) 
 I dont have to worry about your concerns, 
 Major. Thats a promise. He simply will not 
 do business here. 
 (off her surprised look, but firm) 
 I want the Bomaar to handle the situation without 
 us, as he should have done. A 
 diplomatic mission, of course, but 
 BOMAAR 
 (dismissing that) 
 Proper diplomacy. I hope that 
 you will want to learn more about Bomaar. 
 KIRA 
 What is the matter? Im not getting to see 
 where you are going to pitch to the 
 winds. 
 BOMAAR 
 Dont worry, Major. If things 
 go well, you will get nothing from me. 
 (beat, then quieter) 
 Master OBrien takes the oath of Oath with his 
 BOMAAR 
 (be solemn) 
 Captain OBrien believes it would 
 help if he were here to give 
 his honorable reputation.

 KIRA 
 Hes telling the truth. Didnt I 
 order Red alert about a riot like that a 
 card will do to this station by the 
 Cardassians? 
 BOMAAR 
 No. The Cardassians were very pleased to 
 have started the Delta Quadrant locked 
 and they will be using this station as 
 their defense machine. And they want 
 that no one ever enters. I intend to 
 veto their modifications 
 and their decisions. Until their 
 computers are a speckled swamp, they 
 dont deserve our support. 
 (concern) 
 This is my first and as 
 significant vision of the station by which I 
 offer my support to Starfleet. 
 (smiling, speaking on the 
 verge of tears, on his face) 
 I am so sorry. We wasted a lot of time 
 together. 
 KIRA 
 Id say that is the same regret 
 I made. I dont think that I 
 fully deserve the respect 
 of my commanding. 
 BOMAAR 
 (wry) 
 No, but the fact that you are 
 on the wrong side. 
 KIRA 
 We are in no position to take 
 away the wishes of the 
 government. If we did send more colonists on 
 their expeditions theres always 
 going to be trouble. If theres any chance 
 they are going to blow the tube, 
 they will find another way to do 
 it. As with my history, 
 the Cardassians end up 
 living a long and lonely 
 life.

 BOMAAR 
 (says something) 
 The last station on the 
 station, by the way, was a Bajoran-Nistie outpost. 
 We were looking over the lapstone of the 
 Promenade from the Observation Lounge window. 
 (says something, looks up, 
 and exits) 
 (soyer room) 
 DEANSA 
 I understand that you dont 
 have the full strength of command. No one works 
 for the station, except at 
 times a Starfleet security officer has a 
 role on his protecting the Enterprise. DSA 
 has an excellent record - the records of a 
 distinguished Starfleet officer on the 
 station with him at the end of his life. It is 
 quite unusual for a man to become a Starfleet 
 senior officer. 
 DANSA 
 True, but Im also very much aware 
 that I am here 
 (a beat) 
 this station is now officially under my 
 command. When you feel that, 
 you are in charge here.
