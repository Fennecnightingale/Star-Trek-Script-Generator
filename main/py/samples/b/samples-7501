 RAKOTAY (V.O.) 
 Captains log, stardate 5472.4. 
 For the past five months, we have travelled 
 three thousand light years. We have charted 
 seven thousand light years in all that time. We 
 have charted nearly seven thousand light years, 
 and we continue to look. Finally we 
 have seen the Delta Quadrant, and it is still 
 in my head to know what has 
 changed. 
 (Bridge) 
 KIM Im picking up an Neclass warp signature. 
 CHAKOTAY Red sign. 
 KIM The signature is Neclass, and its gone.

 FADE IN 
 16 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) 
 As before. 
 17 INTERIOR PICARD QUARTERS 
 where Picard has brought Jason to his 
 feet. 
 JASON 
 Look at me. 
 At his surprise, PICARD 
 Jason, I thought Id never 
 see you again. 
 Jason looks at him, confused and a bit 
 hesitant. 
 JASON 
 Im not going to say 
 anything. 
 PICARD 
 Why not? 
 Jason looks away from his father. 
 JASON 
 Hes in pain, unable to 
 say anything. 
 PICARD 
 You may go. 
 JASON 
 No, hes not going to say 
 anything. 
 PICARD 
 Jason, please. We have 
 grown in a way your mother has 
 never lived. 
 Jason looks at him for a moment of silent consideration, 
 acknowledging that though he doesnt 
 actually reject the situation she is 
 passionately attached to. 
 JASON 
 Okay. 
 PICARD 
 JASON 
 Okay. 
 And with that, Jason moves back into his room.

 A LARGE CLOUDY OF GOING OF DOUBLE MOLLY is 
 looming over the next set of suns. 
 19 INTERIOR LAB (VPB) 
 Jason is in a small JAIL CELL off to one side, on 
 a piece of equipment that looks like it was 
 designed for a practical jolt. 
 20 ON JASON 
 He is checking a readout. Data is standing nearby. 
 DATA 
 Okay. I have downloaded 
 the defensive targeting 
 relays. They are 
 pretty sophisticated. 
 JASON 
 Good. I still cant believe 
 Datas been able to get 
 those killances. 
 DATA 
 I suppose you disagree. 
 Jason looks at him.

 new problems.
