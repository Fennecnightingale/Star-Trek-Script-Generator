 A moment between them then Troi turns and moves toward them. 
 TROI 
 I wanted to be alone 
 He sees her tentative, tentative attitude. 
 TROI 
 Im afraid its hard to say 
 a thing to people like me. 
 Hes taken the opportunity to 
 object and to contrast himself to her - 
 hes taken the opportunity to 
 humiliate himself in her eyes - an opportunity to 
 humiliate himself in her attitude. Her willingness 
 to play along is encouraged by the male. 
 MELORA 
 There are dangers in store 
 for you - you must learn to 
 expose them 
 TROI 
 There are dangers! 
 
 (beat) 
 For example she is not 
 trained 
 MELORA 
 (carefully choosing her 
 words) 
 Im a person with more experience than 
 people like you.

 Picard reacts - shes a skilled fighter. 
 MELORA 
 One little more, you teach me 
 how to get to where you are going. 
 Picard realizes hes pushed for her. 
 MELORA 
 You must be quite good to survive 
 here. 
 He reacts. 
 MELORA 
 Well, I have been trying to calculate 
 the distances between me and my 
 parents. Turns out they are pretty long 
 distances - two and a half hours to get home. 
 TROI 
 Is that where you grow up? 
 MELORA 
 (matter of fact) 
 I was taken on the Enterprise 
 during a mission of the Endeavour. 
 (beat) 
 The mission got to the Endeavour 
 Nebula. 
 STAR TREK "Melora" - 3/5/90 - ACT TWO 19. 
 20 CONTINUED (4) 
 TROI 
 Endeavour? 
 MELORA 
 It was my mission. 
 (smiling proudly) 
 And I have been loving you ever since. 
 Yet you dont tell me about your 
 home. 
 Troi senses her disappointment. 
 TROI 
 Are you okay? 
 MELORA 
 Im afraid I have some 
 reservations. 
 TROI 
 As do I. 
 Meloras look suggestothers 
 a lack of emotional responses. 
 MELORA 
 Tell me nothing, just the 
 facts - you are an endearing 
 child. I came aboard the Enterprise 
 four years ago to study 
 MECHAYEV 
 (off her look) 
 You are an Endeavour. 
 (beat) 
 And Im afraid thats not what I 
 meant 
 MELORA 
 (mischievous) 
 Maybe not. But you still have to 
 get up to this point. 
 (Beat) 
 You have to get up to there. 
 (beat) 
 And dont say I dont warn you the 
 boys are up 
 She laughs. 
 MELORA 
 (continuing) 
 And Im afraid my explorating 
 with you is not quite 
 exciting but if I seem to have 
 something to be said to you 
 TROI 
 No, its not! 
 Mila stops herself, unhappy, irritated - 
 MELORA 
 There is a whole universe in 
 here just like ours. 
 Id better get to 
 Troi. 
 TROI 
 Yes. 
 (beat) 
 Come, my friend I dont have time 
 to go. I have to find out. 
 We dont have time to waste 
 when we have so many at 
 their side. 
 She looks at him, bewildered and hurt 
 by his statement. 
 RIKER COM VOICE 
 Riker here. 
 Riker turns. 
 RIKER 
 (continuing) 
 We need to talk. 
 RIKER 
 I cant - Worf needs me for 
 his help. Hes in the process 
 of transferring the Relay to the Lab 
 Geordi are making some adjustments 
 we are making and the boys are 
 going to be a couple of years in 
 this interphase. 
 RIKER 
 I understand you have your reasons 
 for why hes doing this 
 RIKER 
 Those are my orders.
