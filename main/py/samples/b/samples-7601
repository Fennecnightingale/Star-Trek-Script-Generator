 the viewscreen. The other Romulans follow them in their 
 wake. 
 RIKER 
 (to Picard) 
 Romulan. 
 The Romulan turns back and continues watching the 
 monitor. Picard looks irritate. 
 PICARD 
 Ambassador, are you all 
 still having difficulty from the 
 shuttle? 
 RIKER 
 (shrugging) 
 Its nothing - its the shuttle. 
 They continue monitoring the console. 
 RIKER 
 We cant make it to the ship

 Captain - can you get a deck of 
 food? 
 (then, to Riker) 
 Do you want something? 
 Riker looks in frustration toward the package Riker is 
 unable to give him the satisfaction. 
 RIKER 
 No thank you. 
 Riker continues to pander to the shuttle. Picard gets 
 behind the couch. 
 PICARD 
 All passengers have been told to return to 
 their ship on the following course 
 in exchange for the zenite, but 
 is all the food delivered.

 gestures to Riker and to take a seat next to the 
 bar. 
 RIKER 
 (continuing) 
 Hows it coming? 
 TROI 
 Two bars, plus a large food replicator. 
 The bar is empty for a moment the two men 
 sit down. 
 TROI 
 Im fine, thank you. 
 RIKER 
 And you have been trying to get 
 something for me to eat, 
 Counselor? 
 TROI 
 Not entirely. Im interested in 
 something that might help 
 me understand why the lines are so 
 different than simply 
 how they look. 
 The bartender comes over. 
 BAR 
 An excellent choice. 
 Riker sits at the bar. The Romulan sits on the 
 floor, feet up on the floor. The bar slowly crawls 
 over to the replicator. Tros unoatedly turns to his 
 left, and the floor responds with a loud SOUND.
