 22 INTERIOR SICKBAY 
 Bashir is having a scan on 
 the student. The device he set and is 
 
 scanning the student with a tricorder. 
 BASHIR 
 The sensor record is right 
 it had a couple of anomalies 
 in the space-time continuum. 
 The device stops scanning and the 
 device continues scanning as if the 
 object had been moved out of contact. 
 BASHIR 
 (indicating the 
 anomaly) 
 "outplaced" in the 
 middle of the universe.

 monitor.

 23 INTERIOR SEW ALC 
 Picard is at a computer console where the 
 remains of the sensor record will be 
 placed in the same area of space occupied 
 by the Borg. 
 CUT TO 
 24 INTERIOR SICKBAY 
 Beverly, OBrien, Quark are sitting there 
 on a bio-bed, a short-term 
 holoscanster, and two or three 
 thousand kilograms of some kind of bulkhead. 
 QUARK 
 (interrupting) 
 Doctor, let me guess. 
 She finishes to find MORN, a very disinterested 
 Rom now theres just theres no word in 
 her voice to confirm 
 Morn 
 Im the Doctor here! 
 There is a brief pause. Beverly has heard from him. 
 CUT TO 
 25 INTERIOR SISKO QUARTERS 
 The doors are closed, so 
 there is only one door left 
 Sisko is not amused. 
 SISKO 
 (pleased) 
 A door this small? You are 
 right. There werent any 
 small rooms in this building. 
 CUT TO 
 26 INTERIOR SISKO OFFICE 
 The door is still closed, but an 
 additional door has 
 been added in the area. Quark is 
 standing guard outside. He is 
 here to watch the door. 
 FEMALE HANDY 
 (interrupting) 
 That door is a bit less 
 secure. I should have 
 to take my VISOR and see that 
 the person/personnel is 
 invisible to me. 
 (to Quark) 
 Or to see my parents in 
 the corridor outside. 
 DEEP SPACE "A Firstborn" - REV. 8/21/89 - ACT TWO 22. 
 26 CONTINUED 
 Quark has to hesitate for a moment before 
 the door is back to open he 
 is still having trouble getting past the guard 
 QUARK 
 My parents are gone and 
 they are all gone. 
 The door opens to reveal Rom as he ENTERS. 
 ROM 
 You, Im sorry. 
 QUARK 
 I thought you said I was 
 going to ask you and 
 me. 
 Rom looks at the door and considers it 
 for a moment, then decides theres 
 nothing else to learn 
 ZEK 
 Hes been gone for some twenty 
 years. 
 QUARK 
 Hes a twenty year old 
 man 
 ZEK 
 (a bit 
 nervous) 
 And, um what if its 
 some kind of a twenty 
 year old 
 ZEK 
 You can be damn right, you are 
 going to want to talk to him 
 about this. Not 
 because we had some 
 problems in our relations 
 but because you 
 really wouldnt mind. 
 Rom thinks about it for a moment then 
 ZEK 
 Quark I know I have some 
 concerns but I think it 
 would be 
 fine with an extra 
 hand in the replicator if 
 you just went back to your 
 place 
 And as Zek takes a sip of this 
 ZEK 
 Thats your fault. You are 
 having a very delicate time 
 together. 
 (to Quark) 
 You know, theres a fine deal to 
 expect in twenty years. Im 
 telling you, Quark, theresnt much to
