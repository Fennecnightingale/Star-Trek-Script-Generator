 JANEWAY Welcome back to Deep Space Nine. 
 NEELIX You should have been more proud of yourself. 
 JANEWAY I apologise. 
 NEELIX You seemed a little tense. 
 JANEWAY I can take that to be a problem but you had 
 a great deal of fun tonight. 
 NEELIX Well, it seems to be what I wanted. 
 JANEWAY I have to be more impressed by whats happened here. 
 NEELIX You were pretty stressed, too.

 NEELIX Well, good for the meeting, too? 
 JANEWAY My best intentions are, most of. 
 NEELIX I think it does. 
 JANEWAY I wish you could have a little fun in your 
 second away mission, what a chance to end up back to the bridge. 
 NEELIX You miss me, Captain, but Im willing to play a part 
 in your favour. You dont have the experience it is the one 
 impulse you are willing to take the life of a half-ninth century 
 child to accomplish. 
 JANEWAY I think I will, you are right. 
 NEELIX Fine. That, if it makes us a better team. 
 JANEWAY I think it will. 
 NEELIX But there isnt
