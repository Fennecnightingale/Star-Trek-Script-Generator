======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 A can, 
 Captain. 
 Sisko sits down at a nearby computer, his face softens slightly as he 
 glances at his new counselor. He takes a deep breath, 
 trying to contain his emotions. 
 SISKO 
 I want to tell you all about ourselves. 
 Something here with you isnt making 
 sense, but if thats what you need, you 
 can go ahead. 
 OBRIEN 
 I will keep working on my 
 program. 
 SISKO 
 Go ahead tell me, Chief. 
 KIRA 
 (to Epran) 
 What are you feeling? 
 Epran looks at Sisko, but Sisko shoots her a look as Sisko 
 shuts him down.

 37 CONTINUED 
 SISKO 
 Not bad I suppose. 
 He takes a seat in the command chair, and the rest of the 
 crew except Epran, who takes off his TINYAN 
 helmet and is back in normal clothes. 
 SISKO 
 (to all) 
 I know what you are feeling about 
 Kira, and I know how much you 
 want her for yourself, but Sisko 
 has made his point firmly. 
 SISKO 
 SISKO 
 Shes not a holodeck character, Sisko. 
 Siskos still troubled, but he doesnt answer the question 
 and the tension in his face.

 37 CONTINUED (2) 
 SISKO 
 Im sorry, Major if I made you feel any 
 wrong. 
 They are sitting in the Command chair. 
 SISKO 
 And I suppose Id prefer to go back to 
 Voyager at this time. 
 OBRIEN 
 (nods) 
 Im all about to be promoted to the 
 Kiarobi position. 
 They are about to get a better idea of where 
 they are going. 
 SISKO 
 Im not sure anyone still follows me there 
 can be any of 
 the four new Jors 
 patrols. 
 ODO 
 (quiet) 
 Kira had no such a 
 chance 
 But Sisko is more than just a threat, he looks 
 very serious. 
 SISKO 
 And I cant figure that out 
 Sisko gets up from his seat and moves 
 over to Dax and starts speaking to her. 
 DEEP SPACE "Emissary Evil" - REV. 7/15/94 - ACT TWO 24. 
 39 CLOSE 
 KIRA 
 No, Im not. Sisko out 
 but one thing I 
 ask is have you report to me at 
 all times when you are not 
 present. 
 SISKO 
 I will meet you here. But 
 you have no obligation to 
 leave a star base 
 Sarek, Odo - you are about 
 to leave. 
 40 CLOSE (OPTICAL) 
 Sisko heads off - the others watch him go, 
 the others hold their breath, and EXIT 
 us to the Promenade. We hold on Sisko 
 thinking about whats coming and how he 
 plans to deal with it. 
 FADE OUT. 
 END OF ACT TWO 
 DEEP SPACE "Emissary Evil" - REV. 7/15/94 - <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> PART TWO 
 (Bridge) 
 Sisko is facing Kira. 
 SISKO 
 (hard beat) 
 There are two Nausican 
 warships approaching 
 the Defiant. One of 
 
 them has a subspace signature. 
 KIRA 
 They will send the Defiant at 
 maximum warp. 
 SISKO 
 (off console) 
 They should be within two 
 kilometers. 
 (beat) 
 Stand by to intercept. 
 KIRA 
 (to Sisko) 
 I cant do anything about 
 that ship. Mister Defiant must 
 want to go to some kind of 
 aid outpost. 
 DEEP SPACE "Emissary Evil" - 12/09/94 - ACT TWO 26.

 SISKO 
 (to Kira) 
 I understand you
