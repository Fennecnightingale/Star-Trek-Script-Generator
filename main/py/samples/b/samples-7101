 And make sure those coals donï¿½t burn through 
 themselves. 
 SISKO 
 Understood, but we are not doing so 
 quite that. I mean, I dont know, but I 
 want to know where it is. 
 KIRA 
 And when?

 KASIDY 
 But you dont live in a remote 
 space. You go through this with a 
 conscience you will find a way 
 out. 
 KIRA 
 But how? How? How did the 
 Cardassians protect you? 
 KASIDY 
 (trying not to let 
 him 
 pass her) 
 Theres plenty of ways out. 
 (thinks that it over) 
 In the end, you never can tell if you 
 can live out your lives in this place. 
 But you can tell me where to find a place. 
 Do you understand? 
 KIRA 
 Yes, I think I understand. 
 Sisko looks around at her with new respect as a quiet smile draws its way 
 closer to his face. But before he can say a word, he 
 sees GARAK sitting at an impass table, trying not to let Kira 
 take the gulp of a gulp. Kira sits next to him.

 GARAK 
 I have been drinking to help pay for 
 his visits. The last one of my 
 dispassion was the gulp I put 
 in. To make you look 
 miserable, isnt it? 
 But the truth is, I have lived with this 
 for too long, and I have given it 
 enough time. 
 (beat) 
 What is its matter with me? 
 Odo looks at her with a look of sympathy he recognizes. 
 ODO 
 (nonchalant) 
 I said get out as much time as possible 
 and make your friends stay in here. 
 (beat he realizes she means it) 
 But your friend. He too. 
 GARAK 
 Yes. 
 ODO 
 I suppose he wont be around long. 
 GARAK 
 They will stay until Arachnia is ready for 
 departure. 
 ODO 
 You see, you just tell me you don 
t want to go with him. 
 Odo shakes his head but still refuses to part with this 
 suggestion. He will go follow the old Goss. 
 16 INTERIOR GHOSS QUARTERS (OPTICAL) 
 where Goss is pacing, a little restless for Gosss usual 
 but for him, theres a certain amount of melancholy. There is something 
 of a certain inevitability here - the only ones of us who 
 want to sit through the Cardassian occupation of 
 Ventax Two are working at a table having eaten meals 
 and talking things on their plates with a few passing 
 N.D.s. Goss is not in his seat. He is moving 
 around the room trying to do his job 
 GOSS 
 I have been trying to figure out my own 
 ration. 
 ODO 
 What happens when the Goss goes out?

 GOSS 
 He gets a lot of calories 
(beat) 
 The other day, when the Goss ate 
 the meal, he went for a little 
 goss-wine. 
 ODO 
 What exactly does he do? 
 GOSS 
 (gent) 
 Follow the recipe. 
 They are sitting. 
 Odo pats him on the back. Goss gets to his feet, 
 glaring down at Odo. 
 GOSS 
 Thats my name Idan. I am the Archon 
 of the Second Order. Ten years 
 ago, I went with my father on a mission 
 to rescue my brothers soul once he was 
 injured. Odo is still at that. 
 ODO 
 When was that? What kind of 
 food was served? Was it some kind 
 of strange vegetable concoction? 
 GOSS 
 I serve it from scratch, Id like to know what 
 is served. 
 Odo gives him a look but
