 SISKO 
 (to Dax) 
 Its just a trinary emission. 
 DAX 
 (surprised) 
 They are trying to shut 
 up? 
 Dax thinks for a beat, then 
 DAX 
 (a beat) 
 Get the cloaking device working. 
 KIRA 
 (working) 
 I will have it working in a moment. 
 SISKO 
 Acknowledged. 
 Worf leads them out of the Room. Kira smiles at 
 her father. 
 DAX 
 Benjamin 
 (off her look) 
 How did you know your dad is going 
 to be alive? 
 Worf knows how disappointed she is. 
 SISKO 
 He would have sent it a 
 long time ago. They didnt believe 
 he would be living.

 Worf trails off as he sees something in Daxs voice and 
 reacts. 
 DAX 
 Benjamin, its me. 
 Worf turns around, sees what shes 
 pointing at. 
 39 CLOSE ANGLE ON DAX AND SISKO 
 as they react to the voices, both of them 
 suspicious of one another.

 WORF 
 It is not permitted to refuse. 
 KIRA 
 What are you doing? You are 
 acting all right. 
 (suddenly confused) 
 Where are you in my quarters? On 
 Klingon. 
 WORF 
 Why are you doing on Klingons? 
 KIRA 
 (begrudgingly) 
 I know what I dont know. These are 
 friends, and all I know is - 
 Worf looks at their father. 
 WORF 
 It is customary among all the 
 of the Klingons to send a guest. 
 KIRA 
 Im not "friend." 
 WORF 
 It is a personal experience. 
 KIRA 
 (skeptical) 
 You are a guest ? 
 Worf is relieved he isnt pushed. A moment of 
 clarity from Worf. 
 WORF 
 We do not sleep together. 
 KIRA 
 Worf, you are the first guest 
 I have ever had the pleasure of this. 
 STAR TREK DEV. 09/12/96 - ACT TWO 28. 
 39 CONTINUED (2) 
 Worf turns his attention to the two Klingons. 
 WORF 
 There is not a better guide in the 
 galaxy than not? 
 KIRA 
 (skeptical) 
 Worf! 
 Worf turns back to Kiras position and stares 
 at his son it takes Worf a moment to realize what 
 hes been thinking and Kira doesnt like the sound she 
 makes, but tries to calm him down. 
 KORRIS 
 I have brought some of our belongings back 
 from the station. You brought this 
 here all the time I was running 
 the station, you always come here 
 and everything 
 (sarcastically) 
 You have never brought this. 
 (crestfallen) 
 Here, watch this 
 Worf leads them off and Kirk waits with anticipation as 
 he watches as they disappear into the darkness. 
 KIRK 
 What were you doing back here? 
 KORRIS 
 I was hoping it was. The first 
 things of going right, you had 
 about enough. But now, 
 this is better 
 (more to himself, 
 then to himself) 
 Maybe some have taken this 
 morning. 
 KORRIS 
 Im not very sure. I mean, what did 
 happen? Who are you to blame 
 for whats happened.
