 Beverly and Geordi are working a panel in the

 GEORDI 
 What was it? 
 He scans the VISor. 
 GEORDI 
 Just some sort of energy emission 
 from the Borg. 
 BEVERLY 
 Could be another symptom of 
 the Borg taking the sphere 
 directly from the vessel.

 GEORDI (Contd) 
 It could be worse

 GEORDI 
 What?

 Not a thing

 FADE IN 
 16 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) 
 A long pause as Worf watches in the Observation Lounge. The 
 doors open and Troi ENTERS and looks surprised. 
 TROI 
 (notices Worf) 
 Hello, Lieutenant. 
 WORF 
 (to Troi) 
 Excuse me. 
 TROI 
 Can I help 
 She hands her a cup of tea and she hands it to Worf. 
 TROI 
 (tugging at her 
 VISOR) 
 You remember something about 
 last night at the IME. 
 WORF 
 (touched) 
 I was at the dinner 
 after I had completed my 
 REMINDANCEMENT. There were 
 five Borg prisoners 
 for a night I was watching 
 them get inside the Observation Lounge 
 (beat) 
 I was the first member of the 
 Borg and this is very strange. 
 Troi turns to him. 
 TROI 
 Did you know any of 
 your group? 
 WORF 
 Yes. I was the third one. 
 TROI 
 Did you drink it? 
 WORF 
 (taken aback) 
 Do you
