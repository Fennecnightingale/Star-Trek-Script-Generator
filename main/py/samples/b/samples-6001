 for that, she will be 
 gone? 
 SISKO 
 Im sorry. 
 SISKO 
 Im just trying to make sure 
 nothing else from the runabout has 
 been damaged. 
 
 Dont believe me, Commander. 
 Im not going to hurt you. 
 Sisko gets up, tries to act tough. 
 SISKO 
 Dont feel sorry for me - I 
 know you are not going to hurt 
 us. But lets go. 
 Dukat and Tain take heavy aim at Siskos 
 wife, who is unbalanced on the floor. 
 SISKO 
 (to all) 
 Im going to hit that woman. 
 Dukat backs down. Bashir grabs his phaser. 
 
 BASHIR 
 Shields at eighty percent. 
 SISKO 
 (to Dukat) 
 But if we dont take those fighters, I will 
 be slaughtered. 
 
 Sisko FIRES his phaser at the woman. 
 SISKO (o.s.) 
 Mister Tain, now! 
 OBrien and Bashir fire their phasers back into Siskos 
 back for what, exactly ? 
 23 EXTERIOR SPACE - RUNABOUT (OPTICAL) 
 A BAJORAN SHIPS swoop down from the destroyed station. 
 BASHIR 
 Shields up to fifty four percent. 
 
 SISKO 
 (to OBrien) 
 You see those vessels, Captain? 
 OBRIEN 
 The Defiant! 
 DEEP SPACE "Civil Defense Force" - Civil Defense Force 
 Built and tested. 
 DAX 
 Your shields failed to comply. 
 SISKO 
 Explain. 
 DAX 
 I dont understand. 
 BASHIR 
 Come back to the station! 
 The female OBRIEN returns to her station in the 
 blink of an eye. 
 SISKO 
 Find out who it is. Try to 
 man the line of attack. 
 OBRIEN 
 They are attacking the station. 
 SISKO 
 On our side of the station. 
 DEEP SPACE "Civil Defense Force" - CUL HOLO 
 As the Defiant MATERIALIZES, the HOLO CAPTS OPENING TIGHTENSHAT CHIMMER the station, and 
 a POLAMMERING DEVICE BEEPS onto the surface. 
 SISKO 
 Fire back.

 But hes already lost her . 
 SISKO 
 Is that a problem? 
 OBrien, confused, FIRES his phaser 
 OBRIEN 
 No. 
 BASHIR 
 A problem? How the hell are you getting 
 out of here? 
 OBrien tries to get on the defensive, 
 but cant. 
 OBRIEN 
 I know this station. Its not 
 a defense. I just tried to 
 get to safety. 
 OBrien FIRES his phaser at around the corner, 
 but nothing. 
 OBRIEN 
 Well, Im glad I could help. 
 The woman FIRES her phaser back out of her 
 direction. OBrien looks away in concern, and 
 decides not to make an attempt to pull her out. 
 OBRIEN 
 I need more time. 
 (to Sisko) 
 OBrien, is that all you can do? 
 We see to what Sisko, Kira and OBrien 
 are doing at that.

 OBRIEN

 Why dont you log that down to 
 Lieutenant Bashir. 
 DEEP SPACE "Civil Defense Force" - 01/08/94 - ACT TWO 17.

 OBRIEN 
 That will be all. 
 LWAXANA 
 Let me tell you something, captain. We 
 didnt take Cardassian prisoners for 
 any one day. Now stop 
 the count. 
 OBRIEN 
 Yes, sir. 
 They EXIT down the ladder, and OBrien begins working his 
 console as Bashir approaches. 
 BASHIR 
 All Im see is that our security 
 problems with our escape and with
