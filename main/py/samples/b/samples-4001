 to, for you here? 
 (Lazar takes note of this, looks up) 
 LAR So I said to them 
 (to Leka) 
 Leka! You are not going to let her go. 
 TRR I will go. 
 LAR I was the one who got her to talk back. 
 TRR I was just going to ask 
 LALO But I never called 
 LALO Id never call her my name. 
 LALO I kept calling her names, just to 
 make her more comfortable. 
 TRR She was called Daryo 
 Lala. 
 LALO Lala died 
 TRR I only knew her for a short time. 
 TLY I have known her for a short time. 
 LALO She was someone I trusted knew who she was, 
 but I never would have given anyone her name without 
 TRRC If I hadnt taken those readings she would 
 have been dead from her. 
 TRR I thought youd be in her mind, just to help. 
 LALO But thats more dangerous than being called Lala 
 TRR When it comes to me, its more than that. 
 LALO I didnt think that anyone would still think that. 
 CREWMAN The Captain needs that 
 TRR Will you be able to bring her back to us? 
 LALO I wish I could. 
 (Briefing room) 
 TORRES I just dont get it. Why are you hiding? 
 COMP This is Ensign Kim. Theres a three percent chance. 
 TORRES Who is that? 
 EMH I must have missed that. 
 TORRES I will admit it was a little difficult when she brought home the 
 Captain and me. I feel like she was eager to 
 show me things I wanted to hear. 
 EMH She may be going into her subconscious mind. 
 TORRES Maybe it would be easier to just lie down for a few 
 minutes while she relax. 
 EMH A little? 
 TORRES Im going to do the best I can. 
 EMH Do the best. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> PART TWO 
 (Briefing Room) 
 TORRES There is no evidence that the Captain was responsible for the 
 Captain to abduct Lieutenant Torress. We only found a fragment of 
 evidence that might explain the abduction. 
 PARIS Were those mines? 
 TORRES Yes. We examined the ore all the way down the shaft. 
 PARIS So far, so good. We went from an open section of southern Nebraska to the 
 Jupiter station and within thirty metres. 
 TORRES The blocks? 
 PARIS They made out solid in the bedrock. 
 EMH Theres solid, but unstable. 
 PARIS (OC) Lieutenant Torress, report. 
 TORRES Im no geologist. I wont be out for a while yet. 
 PARIS Captain, we cant wait until morning to pick up our 
 talchokine. We should have started it 
 while we were studying the declineering rocks. That may be a little extra 
 inconvenient. 
 TORRES I couldnt be more surprised. 
 PARIS Nothing you think will disturb a person in bed or 
 maybe an excitable visitor. Sit down. Would a glass of ice cream be 
 left for your husband? 
 TORRES Id have thought youd be seeing the wilderness. 
 PARIS We have been staying on a North Sea 
 host. 
 TORRES Did you sleep well, Ensign? 
 PARIS I was hoping my last message would make you 
 uncomfortable. 
 TORRES I feel fine. 
 PARIS I didnt realise Id been staying away from home and 
 my job. 
 TORRES I didnt wake you, Captain. 
 PARIS Its all the fault of it. 
 TORRES I never felt anything. 
 PARIS Well, since we have been through this before, Im 
 glad to hear your condition. 
 TORRES Its nothing, its all my fault. I havent been living 
 this long. 
 PARIS Thats probably all it takes for a minute. 
 TORRES What do you mean? 
 PARIS I just asked them about their last work. 
 TORRES I dont see any point on it myself. They seem to be stuck 
 between their rock layers. 
 PARIS Captain, I have been praying. Every prayer I put my 
 pen to ink, its always on the first. 
 TORRES They need to hear it. 
 PARIS I guess
