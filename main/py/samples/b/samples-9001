======== SAMPLE 1 ========

 
 Dax turns to Sisko. 
 SISKO 
 Im glad to see you, but you should 
 take a good look at the hull. 
 I dont know if you have done an 
 er, but you have got to get at that 
 valve before you can take the 
 helms. 
 DAX 
 Maybe I can get it in here. 
 SISKO 
 (referring to map) 
 I know those structural integritys 
 donâ€™t have to be compromised. 
 DAX 
 What if we can turn around? 
 SISKO 
 And make a run for it. 
 DAX 
 (trying hard to get to 
 the bottom) 
 We could use a little heat, maybe ? 
 SISKO 
 You know, your engines could just run 
 into the core and I could lose 
 access or reboot the entire 
 system. 
 DAX 
 You could never gain access to your core 
 because you filled it with 
 running water. 
 DEEP SPACE "THE SEARCH" - REV. 02/16/94 - ACT TWO 23. 
 29 CONTINUED (2) 
 SISKO 
 Yeah, but we could do it. 
 DAX 
 Youd be leaving the next help. 
 Sisko gets to the turbolift. Off our reaction, as we 
 go 
 30 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE DEFIANT (OPTICAL) 
 The ship is turning and we are being tossed about. 
 31 INTERIOR DEFIANT - MAIN BRIDGE 
 where Dax, Deral and Sisko are working. Deral is 
 shaking his head, changing the subject. 
 DERAL 
 I guess you have lost Commander Sisko. 
 DAX 
 Cant he get it off the ship? 
 DERAL 
 Well, as you can see, theres no 
 module to reach out to the bridge. 
 KIRA (O.S.) 
 Thats a ship the runabout. I 
 want you to get it up and running. 
 Dax taps the navigational console. 
 DAX 
 Navigation System one, check it up. 
 They all turn to see - 
 32 ANGLE - THE AIRLOCK (OPTICAL) 
 as it slides open at the co-ordinates of the airlock, 
 crissolving into nothingness. 
 DEEP SPACE "THE SEARCH" - REV. 02/16/94 - ACT TWO 24. 
 33 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL) 
 where Sisko and Deral are watching ArakTaral, a 
 Bolian female named BRAT UDAN, whos twirling in 
 front of Dax and Deral and two N.D. Cardassian Guards one 
 over the other, watching them. BastTaral instantly moves over to Krit 
 and Maques, and the N.D. BRAT UDAN stands up to greet them. 
 GUARDIAN 
 The day you have been waiting for is 
 coming. 
 (smiles) 
 Come on. 
 Sisko and Deral glance up to where shes going to go, then Sisko and 
 Deral exchange a silent look as they walk into the airlock. 
 Sisko immediately moves ahead of the others, taking in their surprise, then 
 SISKO 
 Whos there? 
 GUL DOL 
 Sir. Sisko isnt here. 
 SISKO 
 Are you going to tell us you moved away 
 from it or not? 
 GUL DOL 
 I know I moved. Sisko said you 
 had the Bridge. 
 OFF their reactions. 
 34 ANGLE ON GUL DUAL 
 who shows no signs of his true feelings. We can see Dax walkway 
 with her away from the others, but not even with a glance at all the way or the doors close 
 and the sound of Daxs voice makes it impossible to to tell what shes thinking or do we 
 still not know. We also see that shes dressed in a Starfleet 
 cadets uniform which shes wearing on a mission and is now worn by 
 the beard. GUL DUKAT 
 (unenthused) 
 Commander Krim has 
 always been a symbol of hope for me. 
 (gesturing to a face ushers) 
 But that is old style. 
 DAX 
 (unenthused) 
 Yes. Yes.
