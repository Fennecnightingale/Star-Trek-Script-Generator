 PULASKI 
 (smiles) 
 You are not as bad as you look. 
 You have got a good job. 
 TROI 
 Nothing but good and bad. 
 PULASKI 
 I dont want to go like this, 
 Deanna 
 TROI 
 You dont like me, either. But you 
 have to try again and again. Dont 
 look away, see what you are 
 doing and then go. 
 PULASKI 
 (defensive) 
 As I did, Counselor. 
 TROI 
 So I have to try again And again and again. 
 And again? 
 KRELLOAN 
 Not really. I have done some 
 soul-restering. 
 Its his only hope that he can keep his 
 heart away from the dead. And hes willing like 
 this. He is willing to let this process pass 
 for now. But Troi knows theres more to it.

 KRELLOAN 
 Lets finish the job. 
 TROI 
 My heart. I have worked so hard 
 for six years. I wont get 
 anything done. 
 KRELLOAN 
 Oh, no. No, not at all. 
 They finish the job, but Troi sees things 
 which shes trying very hard to control. 
 TROI 
 I dont think things are 
 going to have to be easy again. I 
 dont have a best friend. 
 KRELLOAN 
 Well, thats what you have 
 started. 
 Troi smiles. Its very endearing. 
 TROI 
 Im glad you can say that. 
 KRELLOAN

 TROI

 I dont know. 
 TROI

 Troi smiles. Its a moment of connection.

 KRELLOAN 
 Very much. 
 TROI 
 I have to say, Kren and Kren are quite 
 unique at this point. 
 KRELLOAN 
 (pleased, off-camera) 
 You have an excellent eye sight, Deanna. 
 Its no surprise you are the one 
 talking to the Prophets. 
 TROI 
 The Prophets wish nothing better 
 for their faithful servant, Kren. Kren will 
 be returning shortly to fulfill the terms of their 
 agreement. 
 (Krens office) 
 PULASKI is a very private office, with no overhead 
 lights. His mood is relaxed, his hand safe. He 
 is listening, unable to conceal his inner face. 
 However, there is a definite underlying nervousness in his 
 approach, even though he 
 does not. When his people speak, their voices 
 are a sound which indicates they are listening. 
 TROI 
 Whats the most significant aspect of 
 our relationship can be when we 
 both have lost our traditional 
 ways.

 anything right.

 KRELLOAN 
 Everyone listens. 
 TROI 
 Kren - the leader of our people. 
 (beat) 
 Leader Kren and Kren - our people. 
 KRELLOAN 
 Our people. We have lost more 
 than we can ever understand.
