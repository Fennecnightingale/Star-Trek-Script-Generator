 CANDOM 
 (to Odo) 
 I assume this is your first 
 contact with Cardassia. 
 (off his look) 
 This is an important 
 moment for the Cardassian 
 people. 
 (a beat) 
 With your help, this may 
 be much more memorable. Thank 
 you, Lieutenant. 
 She and Odo step off, and we 
 CUT TO 
 26 INTERIOR PROMENADE (FORMERLY SCENE 33) 
 CLOSE ON the open portal to the Promenade, which is 
 in darkness. Jake sees the darkness and looks around at 
 the deserted Promenade, where the Promenade is in ruins. 
 JAKE 
 The Promenade, this place? 
 28 INTERIOR PROMENADE - EMPHASIZING JOSEPHON 
 as he continues to watch. A Bajoran, dressed in plain, light- 
 colored clothing, appears to be a Bajoran woman in her 
 late fifties and paplifying, makes her eyes difficult and 
 gestures to her. We 
 CUT TO 
 29 INTERIOR PROMENADE - WIDENS INCLUHEN 
 In the darkness of the Promenade, Jake glances around to make sure 
 nothing has come and he decides to step through. Jake 
 nods politely and he continues.

 JAKE 
 The Promenade is in ruins. The buildings look like their 
 fallen domes. A Cardassian, standing by a Cardassian, 
 approaches the girl. 
 CARDASSIA PRIME 
 (an expression) 
 You are a Cardassian princess. 
 She acknowledges and she EXITS. Jake stares after her, like an 
 animal, waiting for her release. 
 PICARD 
 This is my home for today, and this 
 is your home for the next 
 time, too. Do not 
 be afraid. Be in 
 love with them. 
 Picard moves over, trying not to let the Cardassian 
 overture interfere. 
 PICARD 
 Very sorry about how you behaved. But I 
 am very pleased to hear that you are 
 going to be a hero. 
 The Cardassian lady seems much too pleased to hear this. 
 (continuing) 
 Its no fun seeing you like that 
 proud Cardassian, arent 
 you? 
 (to Jake) 
 What about Bajor? 
 PICARD 
 My dear Bajor, it can be 
 very boring. 
 (off her reaction) 
 Take the rest of the day off. 
 (off his reaction) 
 I promise you, I will get 
 to know you when I am. 
 PICARD 
 Its a simple matter of choice.

 PICARD (Contd) 
 I hope the Cardassian 
 way in the way has never been better. 
 30 INTERIOR PROMENADE - PICARD TURNS (OPTICAL) 
 Suddenly the Cardassian man with the card gets there, 
 stands to greet the Cardassian. The Cardassian 
 man puts the card on the middle of a large, flat Bajoran object with a cover. 
 BASHIR 
 Begin greetings. 
 He studies the card for a moment, then puts the card to the back of 
 the Cardassian lady. 
 BASHIR 
 Begin greetings. Begin 
 greetings. How you greet 
 someone you dont have? 
 PICARD 
 Tell me, a Cardassian, how did you get 
 such excellent service? 
 BASHIR 
 You were the runner-up in 
 the Cardassian Central 
 Scouting. To the rank of 
 promotion.
