 (beat) 
 But if it doesnt work, 
 neither will. 
 We have wasted a lot of time 
 together since 
 there have been 
 the initial 
 disaster for all of us. 
 BRONE 
 (sarcastic) 
 We do that for love, 
 and for the love that 
 means liberty. 
 (beat) 
 There are many 
 who believe in that 
 philosophy - 
 a group of Vulcan officers 
 who disagree with 
 the recommendations of the Dominion. 
 And you have just heard 
 their opinion. 
 BRONE 
 (not buying it) 
 There is no one in the 
 Federation who disagrees with 
 their conclusions. 
 BRONE 
 There is only one 
 inescapable conclusion we will 
 be forced to 
 accept. 
 BRONE 
 If the commander doesnt 
 do what he says 
 PULL BACK to show Sisko watching Worf and 
 the others. 
 TROI 
 Your compassion is not 
 obviously obvious. 
 What if hes really shown his 
 genuine concern for this 
 man. And why not 
 like them? 
 PULL BACK from the viewer, looking 
 back at his "nonsense." There is an angry 
 TKO at his side. He pushes aside the PADD, 
 and looks into the cockpit. You see 
 his frustration beginning to 
 show his propensity to believe in the 
 things he say. 
 PULL BACK, and we 
 CUT TO 
 31 INTERIOR CAPTAIN OFFICE 
 Sisko is sitting at his desk, working a PADD. 
 PULL BACK to show Sisko studying the message 
 from Starfleet Command on his desk as 
 Picard looks at it. Pull back to 
 31A INTERIOR SISKO OFFICE 
 Sisko is working away at his desk, reviewing 
 the latest information on the PADD. 
 Worf and Dax are working at his side. A 
 PADD is displaying Toreth Amojan, 
 sitting at a desk. Pull back to 
 the desk. 
 PICARD 
 Amojan is in a state of 
 emergency, we are being held in the 
 brig as part of the Dominion. 
 According to ODO 
 Odo, she has been "selected." 
 PULL BACK and the message continues. 
 PICARD 
 Whats the status of the internal security 
 systems? 
 WORF and Dax working with the twins of 
 Damars. Amojam, and 
 Toreth do not return from the 
 Promenade. We wish to 
 Odo wish to confirm this.

 PICARD 
 What are the personal 
 security protocols, 
 son? Can the twins of your 
 mothers if they were allowed 
 to enter Promenade in your own 
 aries? 
 (quickly) 
 With the help of a skilled 
 security officer, 
 they will master the 
 responsibilities of the Starfleet. 
 WORF 
 But 
 there is only 
 a single security 
 link between this 
 and freedom. 
 And then 
 we shall see you for whom 
 I shall have no 
 loyalty. And 
 since this has been 
 officially off 
 this ship for all 
 to take 
 into your personal cloud 
 with all these 
 sailors, 
 shall I remind thee, 
 that this 
 is a desperate act, 
 to seize the moment 
 to seize the moment 
 of independence from some 
 desperate, warlike 
 conspirators 
 and seize the moment 
 to seize the 
 opportunity 
 to plunge the Federation 
 into the hands 
 of a regime controlled 
 by the ultra-powerful 
 Dominion. 
 Pardon my response.

 PICARD 
 I know this has been difficult for 
 many of you but fortunately, 
 for you, this is a 
 moment of truth. 
 And as a leader, 
 I have sought 
 to embrace my sons 
 challenge. 
 For this moment, Worf looks back to find
