======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 a me? 
 QUARK 
 You are the one who has not 
 told his superiors where he has 
 come from. 
 RASMUSSEN 
 (off his look) 
 Oh, hes going to answer. 
 She moves toward the kitchen, sets the ingredients down in the bowl. 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Muse" - REV. 04/24/98 - ACT TWO 24. 
 26 CONTINUED 
 RASMUSSEN 
 Excuse me. Am I interrupting? 
 Odo glances from the watch to see her. 
 ODO 
 Major 
 She turns away, looks at him, then returns to 
 work. 
 27 INTERIOR BAJORAN FIRE CAVES - SECOND LEVEL 
 As Jake and Kasidy move through what 
 appears to be an abandoned tunnel. They move with 
 their weapons at high - 
 ODO 
 This is the third one to show 
 the location of our missing officers. 
 (beat) 
 I thought one of those might be the 
 one where the blood tape tells 
 us where 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Muse" - REV. 04/24/98 - ACT TWO 25. 
 27 CONTINUED 
 KASIDY 
 Thats the second one to be found 
 by Quark since we arrived. 
 KIRA 
 When I first thought there was 
 something strange, I didnt have it 
 in all, and I didnt have your 
 kind of faith in it. 
 KASidy glances up at the watchful eyes on Odo. 
 KASIDY 
 If that happens again, the rest 
 of us will be lost in the 
 Cardassians. And if 
 so, Im sure you can understand, I 
 know that it will be hard to convince 
 them not to blame us. 
 KIRA 
 How have you come to? 
 ODO 
 Im not sure. 
 KASIDY 
 How have you handled this? 
 ODO 
 I have been through some minor 
 mistakes. I know you will be better if 
 you pay extra attention to your own 
 beliefs. 
 KIRA 
 They are the only ones who I have respect 
 from now on. 
 Odo thinks this through, but his conscience speaks. 
 ODO 
 I can help you with that. 
 KASIDY 
 But its not my fault. 
 Odo stops short, so is she. 
 ODO 
 (a quiet beat) 
 If you get in line and use that transporter 
 device, it wont be a long shot. 
 KASidy gives him a cold look, but Odo shoots back 
 and takes out his phaser. 
 ODO 
 I will be careful. 
 The crew has heard this and they want to hear it. 
 KASIDY 
 (sotto, co.c.) 
 Dont worry. Its my fault too. The 
 transporter device got off line. 
 ODO 
 Why? 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Muse" - REV. 04/24/98 - ACT TWO 25A. 
 27 CONTINUED (2) 
 KASIDY 
 I know why Odo broke his directive and 
 started talking. He thought it might 
 help to get in on my turf. 
 ODO 
 I thought it might be easier if the 
 transporter went off line in order 
 to get to work. 
 KASIDY 
 (shrugs) 
 Well, it wasnt me fault 
 She turns to face Odo, but he is not sure if hes 
 doing the right thing here. 
 ODO 
 I dont understand what you are 
 saying. 
 (pause) 
 I never do 
 She turns back, looks up at his own eyes. 
 ODO 
 I see. 
 ODO 
 You dont have to believe what this man was 
 doing. 
 ODO 
 I dont believe it. Odo cant believe 
 it, does he? 
 ODO 
 Dont believe what its like. Hes looking 
 after your head. 
 ODO 
 He wants to kill us. 
 ODO 
 And the Constable can no more 
 than that and he can no longer 
 let Chief OBrien out of the 
 running. 
 ODO 
 What Constable thinks about the 
 transporter device? 
 ODO 
 They seem to have different designs
