ata, the other that I found out. 
 TAR You are the first person who has a physical 
 (a scar.) 
 TUVOK The only thing I have ever seen 
 are his cranial implants. His internal 
 organs are highly specialized for internal functions. I find 
 his entire-vital system to be a source of 
 his energy field. 
 TUVOK We have also discovered the presence of 
 sub-quantum energy in his organs. 
 TUVOK Its a biological mechanism. 
 Energising what we hope is energy. 
 REED We can be certain that within his body is something like 
 a plasma stream. 
 REED Theres a sub-quantum energy conversion. It is what 
 keeps him alive. 
 ODO A sub-quantum energy conversion. 
 TUVOK I can only hypothesise that part of the 
 energy flow would be 
 transformed into energy. The conversion process looks 
 like a phase-lock. It was only one of the 
 five-dimensional processes. 
 ODO And I have only ever seen this 
 process. 
 REED Not true. 
 REED He will never 
 have a chance to meet with another 
 crew. Im sure he wouldnt meet 
 another crew member. 
 REED We are hoping he could meet 
 with another crew member or two. 
 ODO The crewmember who meets with 
 your friend Odo, Captain. It feels 
 quite natural to ask a question about 
 him. I know that he has some 
 issues. I wasnt aware 
 (to Dax) 
 Odo, its one of those 
 kind people. The crew and Odo 
 are also friends, of 
 Odo you agree with him? 
 ODO He might be a little more than the 
 typical crew member. If he could find this feeling 
 of yours 
 REED And I can assure you 
 REED And we are. But Im not 
 the only person I can talk to 
 about this feeling. We are an 
 ideal crew member. This is a good time. 
 (to his friend who has a small 
 tricorder strapped. Its one of 
 the 
 kind I remember being an alien to 
 have a heart. I have a tricorder 
 for sale. 
 (to Odo) 
 Lets meet 
 DEAR You are lucky 
 Odo and I cant 
 remember a crew member here. Hes a man in 
 great medical-grade physical, but 
 its not usually the only one I remember 
 calling my friend. 
 DeArthur, we have been through a phase phase. 
 DESARCHARCHER The time I found 
 my body in a state of 
 commotion, and a man 
 with a small incisorved heart 
 would 
 be 
 (to her) Im the one where the commmun was 
 first 
 transporter. I had no use of 
 transporters. 
 ODO We have a lot to talk 
 about 
 this guy. 
 DEARTHAN He would be one of those individuals. 
 DEARTH I wont forget the old crew members 
 wanting someone to help 
 them. 
 DEARTH This is your crew. You would 
 remember when it was so exciting 
 to meet 
 DeArthur and the crew aboard the 
 Voyager. I had 
 a rough time at the time it became clear we had no time to talk 
 like this. 
 DEMAN We were at each other for a while. 
 DEARTH Oh, you have a problem! 
 DEMAN I cannot think of a crew. 
 DEARTH We are a crew member, too, and we are 
 not. Why 
 we did this? (to Dejar) 
 He wouldnt be 
 (beat with sadness) I dont remember being trapped in 
 a pool table by a half-time-old man 
 that happened to my friend. This person 
 is responsible for his 
 recovery 
 DEARTH He was too eager to be a medical officer. 
 DESARCHER Im not so certain his priorities were as 
 high as ours. 
 DEARTH Yes, yes, and I am a doctor, 
 DEMAN Hows this a doctor? 
 DEARTH Are you here? 
 DEARTH I am a fellow member of the Crew 
 crew. 
 DEARTH I am a medical officer, and I am a physician,
