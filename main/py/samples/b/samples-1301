 response your food. 
 LESSING I have grown quite a reputation for eating well, 
 my dear. 
 LESSING My friends. 
 LESSING That is just the way you do now. 
 LESSING You say that you will eat me, but why? 
 LESSING Because I am the head of a civilised man. 
 LESSING Your civilised man? 
 LESSING I will eat you now. 
 LESSING Your name is a little misgathered here and there 
 but not this. 
 LESSING That is not your civilised 
 persona. 
 LESSING Do you have a name? 
 LESSING I have an identity. I am a member of 
 civilization that once lived on this galaxy. 
 LESSING You are a creature I created, something 
 beyond your own imagination. The man you created on 
 Earth is still a beautiful young man. 
 LESSING You and I have a common cause. You might be 
 seeing that if I did not imagine you'd become such a hotbed for such a great 
 empire. 
 LESSING This is the greatest empire? You cant explain a ship like 
 this, your best friend. 
 LESSING If I do not eat this world, it wont do 
 you much good to stop you, you know, your friend. 
 (Lessa smiles) 
 LESSING That is what these people want.

 LESSO Your friend? 
 LESSO Your friend must have an animal as loyal and loyal? 
 LESSO Theres always that. You see a great empire out there, 
 a great empire? 
 LESSO It doesnt have a name. But as you see now do, there 
 and there is no such a thing that could have been your friend. 
 LESS O No, 
 LESSO Theres so much for you to learn in the meantime, isnt there? 
 LESSO Your friend - the rest of you on Earth, there 
 you are. 
 LESSO You know nothing about a civilised woman. And you have been 
 allowed to become a great empire. 
 LESSO Yes 
 LESSO. 
 (Lessa reaches out and takes his hand.) 
 LESSO. 
 LESSO. I am so honoured I shall die as your champion and you shall 
 become the lord of this galaxy by feeding yourself to one human. 
 LESSO. 
 LESSO. Yes. 
 (She starts to leave) 
 LESSO. 
 KIRK Kirk here. Please. 
 KIRK Mister Spock, I have seen how many you know about the galaxy you have seen, the empire you have seen, The empire you have seen. And this empire you have seen is a 
 very fearsome empire. All things, they are fierce. 
 SPOCK Captain Kirk 
 KIRK You know they wont leave forever. 
 SPOCK They will, in a few years. 
 KIRK You will see. They dont leave. And they do not have a name. 
 KIRK Spock, have you seen that the human beings have seen you, they have seen you. They will return you to 
 Earth. And to your home planet. 
 SPOCK They will return you to Earth 
 KIRK You will. And they will kill you.
 SPOCK They will kill you? 
 KIRK No. 
 SCOTT The human race will destroy you. 
 SPOCK A human named Spock was once on the galaxy, Captain. A human, a human and a human. 
 KIRK We all have the intelligence. You have the intelligence. 
 SPOCK You may not understand what it is to be an empire, but it requires time, and I suggest you 
 think of it as a long arduous journey. 
 KIRK The human. It cannot exist. And because you do not exist, it must be changed. 
 LESSING If the human is truly a warrior, you will die. 
 TALIS It will look old on the universe, old men and a very old man, a 
 human woman, a human female. The human female is in great shape. It is all humanoid. 
 KIRK All right. 
 TALIS You will have the opportunity to go home and take your rightful place. 
 KIRK A warrior? 
 TALIS You could be a great warrior, too.
