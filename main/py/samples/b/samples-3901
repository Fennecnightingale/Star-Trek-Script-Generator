 forty be an 
 Ico-deck. 
 (Holodeck - corridor) 
 TORRES This is all the top Party of the Bajoran 
 government. The meeting concludes. 
 (Holodeck - corridor) 
 CHAKOTAY I will withdraw the tactical armour. We cant stand this 
 close to an offensive. Dont let this die. 
 (EMH - EMH) 
 EMH Commander, Im having a problem. 
 (EMH - EMH) 
 TUVOK There hasnt been 
 (EMH - EMH) 
 TUVOK Her injuries are minor, but I havent learned 
 any good. 
 CHAKOTAY I was hoping her life could be 
 short of violence. 
 EMH A question if you wouldnt mind. I was once a 
 drone at the military controls centre. 
 CHAKOTAY We used to have a disagreement about 
 everything we were doing here. 
 EMH It was like the dispute over what you were once. 
 CHAKOTAY I went over to an Orion control unit 
 and asked them where their shield grid might be. 
 EMH I dont recall getting to meet the others 
 of my people. 
 CHAKOTAY I didnt know they had a problem 
 here. 
 TUVOK There must be a reason. I have learned 
 people, things that bother them - you have been 
 on my radar, listening to their 
 comm. 
 CHAKOTAY Do you know who I spoke to. 
 JANEWAY I talked to TUVok this morning. Hes very 
 compassionate. 
 EMH He seemed to tell the truth, Chakotay. 
 CHAKOTAY Really?! 
 EMH I told you I was working on a 
 weapon that will destroy your enemies, 
 so you will tell them when its ready. 
 KIM Youd better beam us to the shield 
 now. 
 EMH Im not ready for them to return fire. 
 CHAKOTAY But I will. 
 EMH There isnt much time. 
 KIM What kind of weapon would be best suited 
 to work with? 
 (EMH - CHASER BRIDGE) 
 EMH A tactical vinculum. 
 CHAKOTAY Do you know how to use it to target 
 the shield matrix? 
 EMH I used it this morning to board my ship. The Orions 
 are getting destroyed one by one. Im 
 projecting thousands of Orions on the Bridge. I 
 must retreat to the lower decks. 
 CHAKOTAY Theres too many Orions you have opened 
 up. You will have to relocate us all over the ship. 
 EMH No one will leave until we know what this 
 weapon is capable of doing. 
 CHAKOTAY They will have weapons at our disposal. 
 TEEMI They are useless. 
 CHAKOTAY What are you getting at? 
 TEEMI I wish my people might have done something to help us 
 in finding a cure for the Burn. 
 CHAKOTAY It was only a few weeks ago. I wish to 
 help you again. 
 TEEMI How long ago did you develop these feelings? 
 CHAKOTAY One week. 
 TEEMI Well, its not completely my issue. Many of the 
 people we work with are quite fond of you. In fact, 
 I suppose I have become friends. 
 CHAKOTAY Well, if we were to meet someone, 
 were gonna tell me that you have had a crush 
 on someone? 
 TEEMI I could tell you the same thing. 
 CHAKOTAY And thats why you are here. 
 TEEMI I thought your people were already having 
 a crush on you? 
 CHAKOTAY Theres more to what I told you. 
 TEEMI I have a crush. I want to 
 be the ones who has it too. 
 CHAKOTAY Tell me more about your love with love. 
 TEEMI Im having a love now. 
 CHAKOTAY Oh, dont tell it. 
 TEEMI Love is a dangerous power. You must learn to suppress it. 
 CHAKOTAY I was trying to help to. 
 TEEMI I will be glad if youd try. 
 (EMH - CHASER BRIEFING ROOM) 
 EMH Commander Chakotay. 
 CHAKOTAY What is it? 
 EMH A force field I placed on an Orion platform
