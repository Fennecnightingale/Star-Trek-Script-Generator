 (Bridge) 
 (Kirk is sitting at the Captains desk) 
 KIRK Kirk here. 
 SPOCK What is the current on that course, Captain? 
 KIRK On our setting, if we proceed to burn to maximum velocity, we will lose time. 
 SPOCK Then we will go lower speed and use auxiliary power to deflectors. 
 KIRK That will reduce our speed but it will reduce our course. That will make them turn slowly. 
 SPOCK They will continue on this course. 
 MCCOY The ships temperature must run very high. I cant let it rise. 
 KIRK Cut full power to deflectors. 
 SPOCK Engaging deflectors. 
 MCCOY They have got one hell of a problem. They need power to the deflectors. 
 SPOCK Need to reroute deflectors. 
 KIRK Reroute deflectors to minimum speed. 
 SPOCK That wont give them time. They must know we are going to burn to maximum speed to avoid attack. 
 KIRK They are going to shoot to pick us up
