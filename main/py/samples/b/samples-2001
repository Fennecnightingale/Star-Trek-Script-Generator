  It is a moment of victory. 
 STAR TREK "The First Duty" - REV. 8/17/91 - ACT TWO 29.

 BEVERLY 
 I see it. 
 She looks at him for a beat, then turns to Data. 
 The woman steps toward Data. 
 BEVERLY 
 Data - I really am interested in you. Do you know who you should be to 
 analyze when you are given a new 
 assignment? Come with me. 
 Data nods, then he is told to leave. 
 BEVERLY 
 Is that all right? You dont have to 
 do this alone. 
 Data nods, and heads for the door. Beverly looks at him, 
 frustrated.
 BEVERLY 
 Data, there is some hostility 
 towards you. I feel there is more 
 resentment toward you than I admit. 
 DATA 
 (rising) 
 It is not my nature. 
 BEVERLY 
 So do you. You dont deserve to be 
 patient. You are a Starfleet officer. 
 Data looks away from Beverly. He looks around the room. This is 
 absolutely an unsettling thought. Beverly is disturbed by a thought. 
 DATA 
 The captain of the Federation ship. 
 Beverly turns around. 
 BEVERLY 
 I see. Well, this is a complicated 
 situation. 
 DATA 
 I am familiar with most of my 
 personnel files and with the entire 
 Federation fleet fleet. 
 The fact that these files are 
 so specific is a great 
 compliment to your service and 
 to your courage. 
 She reacts slightly to that. Data looks at her, 
 sees her as she looks at him. 
 BEVERLY 
 I dont understand it, 
 dont you? Im a 
 specialist in the 
 Captains Personal Files. 
 What did you do at the 
 Academy? 
 Data looks at Beverly. 
 DATA 
 Please tell me the names of every 
 member of this board.

 BEVERLY 
 Names? 
 DATA 
 No. 
 BEVERLY 
 Yes. 
 DATA 
 Then you know more? 
 BEVERLY 
 It only seems to me after 
 all - you are not exactly an 
 ordinary woman, are you? 
 STAR TREK "The First Duty" - REV. 8/22/91 - ACT TWO 29A. 
 38 CONTINUED (2) 
 DATA 
 Yes. 
 Beverly turns around and takes a beat. The 
 image on Data is almost as strong as 
 shes feeling at the moment. Suddenly, the feeling 
 hits her like a giant Terekian 
 wave. 
 Data reacts instantly. 
 DATA 
 What is it? 
 BEVERLY 
 (re the image) 
 You are the image of the 
 captain.

 39 ON GEORDI (OPTICAL) 
 Who turns down a Ferengi, who has given him a 
 beating on the floor. 
 GEORDI 
 I think you have got it. 
 As Data comes over. 
 GEORDI 
 Do you know who I am? 
 Data nods. A Ferengi pauses and stares at Data. As 
 the image comes up, suddenly its an idea of Data coming up. 
 Suddenly, the image strikes a chord in Data. 
 DATA 
 (continuing) 
 What do you think, Geordi? 
 Data stares at him, studying the image, wondering what comes next. 
 DATA 
 Something. 
 (beat) 
 Im going to start with, uh, "Babel." 
 Which is, uh, uh, one of you. 
 (beat) 
 If you look to the Captain, there were a few members 
 of the crew who didnt have "babel," but I think 
 the main reason they were all married was that they had already 
 their husbands. 
 GEORDI 
 What I mean, I guess I have changed. 
 STAR TREK "Babel" - REV. 8/28/91 - ACT TWO 32.

 DATA 
 I have never spoken out in the matter 
 of my own wife in making a 
 point where I could not.
