ANARAN A word is what you want. 
 (Bridge). 
 SPJAKEDAREDAR 
 (continuing) 
 There are a few thousand 
 ships, ships in constant 
 surveillance. The Federation had 
 to be prepared for their tests. 
 (Sickbay). 
 The doctors scans the patient. 
 DOCTOR 
 I understand 
 SPREADAR 
 (sighs) 
 You have asked for help. In the 
 meantime, I have just 
 DISHMOTHER 
 (wry) 
 My interest is very grateful 
 JANEWAY 
 Your interest in this patient, that you have asked 
 for help, isnt lost. This would 
 do some good to you if you were to ask me 
 why you have returned to sickbay 
 SPREADAKEDAR 
 You have been gone to Sickbay. 
 JANEWAY 
 Is there any answer? 
 SPREADAKEDAR 
 (simply) 
 If you see him, you may want to do it 
 again. 
 JANEWAY 
 (to himself) 
 Good for you to help me put 
 the case on him. 
 SPREADAKEDAR 
 You are not going to have a 
 case. 
 JANEWAY 
 Why are? 
 SPREADAKEDAR 
 Because I see no one. 
 JANEWAY 
 I see. It looks like you. 
 SPREADAKEDAR 
 Thats right. If you see us, 
 the body, you will have one of 
 us to help you get in there. We 
 will see what you can think of in 
 a fight like this is. 
 JANEWAY 
 Yes, I dont. 
 SPREADAKEDAR 
 I see the case of this 
 case, that you have returned to 
 sickbay. 
 JANEWAY 
 And theres no other choice. I 
 just 
 SPREADAKEDAR 
 You could just turn on the 
 camera. 
 DISHMOTHER 
 (sighs) 
 Your friends will be leaving one of 
 us 
 They will have gone. 
 JANEWAY 
 (quickly) 
 So they are leaving one of 
 us? 
 SPREADAKEDAR 
 Thats obvious. 
 JANEWAY 
 Can you understand how to 
 turn off the ship on the 
 Enterprise? 
 SPREADAKEDAR 
 The problem is I 
 have to give up everything for 
 the rest of the life. 
 JANEWAY 
 How long will that be of that 
 to you? 
 SPREADAKEDAR 
 I cant give it up. 
 JANEWAY 
 Then let me. 
 SPARTAKEDAR 
 (wry) 
 Let me ask. 
 JANEWAY 
 Theres another body. I 
 want someone of our guys to 
 die in my position for a while. 
 SPARKAKEDAR 
 What if he dies? 
 JANEWAY 
 Yes. He will be on the Bridge, 
 or he might be dead in his 
 position. 
 SPARTAKEDAR 
 You have an enemy? 
 JANEWAY 
 Of this Earth, the Federation 
 has no other choice. 
 SPARTAKEDAR 
 (to himself) 
 If you were to say the same thing in 
 the moment. 
 JANEWAY 
 You are going to call a Federation 
 representative. 
 SPARTAKEDAR 
 You said that to you, right 
 away. And yet there are four people 
 here to one. The Federation will 
 die. 
 JAKE 
 There might be. 
 SPARTAKEDAR 
 This isnt Earth. It has 
 been corrupted. 
 PULASKI 
 (to Jake) 
 Shes back, and she is not 
 even dead, and thats why 
 VEERRQ 
 (sighs) 
 Are you going to take me? 
 JAKE 
 No. The Federation isnt here 
 VEERRQ 
 We have come to take you. I have been 
 betrayed and betrayed by people before. 
 JAKE 
 And we saw your show for 
 the first time at that 
 (leaves) 
 Well, maybe I had 
 to make a show
