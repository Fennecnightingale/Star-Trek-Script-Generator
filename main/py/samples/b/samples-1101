 and no one is more interested in his own crew 
 than 
 Captain Archer is. 
 DUKAT 
 If you think we are here, and 
 arent? 
 A beat, then DUKAT 
 (interrupting) 
 BASHIR 
 (to Archer) 
 Yes, I know. 
 TLYA 
 What, then? 
 BASHIR 
 (softly) 
 Good old Starfleet. 
 (to Dukat) 
 They will have to stop calling 
 the captain home a long 
 time. 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Lonely Among Us" - REV. 9/13/96 - ACT TWO 19. 
 19 CONTINUED (2) 
 BASHIR 
 It might be a while before they stop calling 
 you home, Dukat. Its just a 
 matter of time. 
 TLYA 
 Its my first officers honor to 
 serve 
 you. You will have nothing to apologize 
 about. 
 BASHIR 
 (re Dukat) 
 Im sorry. His memory is 
 an asset we are selling for 
 you. Its yours. You can 
 find its value. I will 
 find it. 
 And if you dont want it, you will 
 get one to make the sale. And once we 
 have found it, we will 
 put it on display for you. I 
 could wait for someone else. 
 ADI 
 We could always be looking 
 for a way to change the 
 price, but for us both 
 to come with it 
 that chance would be a violation of 
 honor. What do you want? 
 BASHIR 
 (shrugs) 
 The sale was over. 
 He turns back to DUKAT. He looks at the 
 Cardassians again, as if trying to 
 decide what to make of an attractive. 
 BASHIR 
 Why did you bring me here, 
 to sell? 
 (a beat) 
 Maybe one of the Founders 
 had a problem with you. I 
 knew all about the Founders, 
 from their best records. 
 ADI 
 It really bothers them. 
 BASHIR 
 I have made a promise for you 
 to keep that very quiet for as 
 long as you remain here. I 
 ADI 
 That shouldnt be a problem - I could 
 give them how to handle their 
 problems. 
 BASHIR 
 I hope so. You were going to 
 meet your families, your children, and your entire 
 crew, you
