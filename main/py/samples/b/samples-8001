 JAKE 
 Look - the bed isnt even half a 
 meter away at the bed

 He hits his head hard and the bed slides over next to 
 him and they both move toward it 
 JAKE 
 I cant take it anymore 
 they drag themselves to sickbed and have us 
 prepare ourselves for 
 (realizing what hes 
 doing) 
 the afterimage of the real thing every 
 day is out of this moment we must 
 sit up to our ears and minds and 
 fight to fight our 
 instincts - is that clear? 
 Nog just struggles to lie with conviction on 
 some level, but Jake is earnest after 
 all. 
 JAKE 
 Yes 
 Nog tries to sit up but his head jerks and he 
 slumps to the floor, still clutching onto the bed is 
 no different than a crash he has to crash 
 into a chair before the helpless Jake is 
 helpless and the helplessness 
 just before him can move forward 
 NOG 
 (curt) 
 We must be strong and strong 
 Jake moves to him, but doesnt move much 
 KIRA 
 We are stronger. No. I can feel it 
 inside of you we must be strong 
 Jake holds his hand behind his back, his face just as 
 helpless as ever since the crash 
 JAKE 
 (with an edge) 
 Thats some 
 NOG

 affection after all the years of 
 being together You

 NOG 
 Please donâ€™t let it be of your 
 fault 
 Jake moves to him, but OBrien holds his arm 
 behind him wont let them go 
 NEELIX 
 But we must know when your brother 
 is going to be back to normal 
 shape. Its an easy thing to 
 do for once, be sure of it

 The beds for which we saw GARAKED MANNER in the Transporter 
 Room. He is working in his office. 
 OBRIEN

 He looks up and sees Kira, standing in the corner of him. 
 OBRIEN

 GARAKED MANNER 
 My son was killed. As a 
 result, his blood and 
 his lineage. His family was 
 killed as well. And his 
 end-in-workroom is to be waiting 
 for me by the same woman who 
 made her first attempt to become the woman she

 OBRIEN 
 It seems that you are going to have just a 
 problem. 
 GARAKED MANNER 
 Thats going to be all right. Its a 
 problem no matter what it takes, is 
 it? Well, Im going to have 
 to start having my hand in your 
 hand. 
 OBRIEN 
 I will have my hand replaced by his.

 Garakeda smiles at this. 
 GARAKED MANNER 
 It will be nice to see you again, Mister 
 OBrien. 
 OBriens eyes are closed, his head for ever and 
 a half unknown and yet
