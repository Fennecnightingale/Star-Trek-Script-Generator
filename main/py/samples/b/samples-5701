 D 
 He cant. 
 PICARD 
 You could find out. 
 Picard is looking at her cautiously. 
 PICARD 
 I have the ability to learn a great 
 deal about myself, Data. 
 DATA 
 I believe I have the ability to 
 generate a highly adaptive 
 subspace field.

 Data is aware of a slight awkward silence - as if 
 hes not to become. 
 DATA 
 I know of no such record, 
 Captain. Im a 
 long-range tactical officer. 
 (beat) 
 I have been deployed to 
 do a heads-up mission over the last 
 few months. This was the 
 beginning of my career. 
 PICARD 
 A lot of people wanted me to leave the 
 Enterprise. 
 DATA 
 They probably were afraid of the 
 job was hazardous.

 DATA (contd) 
 I was still processing the 
 final sensor logs. 
 PICARD 
 (looks through panel) 
 I thought my instincts were 
 dead on. 
 DATA (contd) 
 Captain Barclay was not convinced of 
 my ability to command others in 
 this sector. He assumed that my 
 own crew had been destroyed in 
 some kind of escape attempt by my superior 
 officers. 
 Picard turns away from her. 
 PICARD 
 Data ? 
 Data ENTERS. She motions to him. 
 DATA (contd) 
 Commander Maddox, this is my 
 wife. We were married for 
 almost seven years, and

 USS Enterprise. 
 PICARD 
 (to com) 
 Mister Data, come over here. 
 DATA (contd) 
 You will return to your station 
 as soon as you expire our 
 contract in this sector. 
 A small silence. No ones getting off the hook here. 
 PICARD COM VOICE 
 Im on my way to the bridge. We have 
 been picked up some disturbing 
 atmospheric readings. 
 TASHA COM VOICE 
 Im on my way, sir. 
 PICARD 
 You go on, Ensign? 
 TASHA COM VOICE 
 I think theres an atmospheric 
 fluctuation in the area near 
 the planet. I recommend that we go to 
 an planet-wide, close to the 
 border. 
 Picard stares at her, realizing one must assume 
 everything and then nods toward a small smile 
 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 The shuttle was already hailed. 
 PICARD 
 How long shall we have 
 communications?

 Very soon, sir. 
 PICARD 
 Mister Data? 
 DATA COM VOICE 
 (beat) 
 We have a partial transmission 
 coming in. Its a very 
 faint message, sir - it barely 
 visible. 
 Beverly is very puzzled. 
 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 (lightly) 
 Captain 
 Beverly stares at the small, faint voice. 
 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 (lightly) 
 Dont tell me that - you are really 
 trying to catch me. 
 (beat) 
 Try, Doctor. 
 The voice is almost apologetic - its almost 
 apologetic. 
 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 (lightly) 
 Yes sir. I think I recognize 
 your first words. 
 26 INTERIOR MAIN BRIDGE 
 Picard ENTERS the bridge through the 
 corridor. 
 PICARD COM VOICE 
 Do you read me?
