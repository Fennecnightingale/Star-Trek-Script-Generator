 man. He looks 
 over, grimaced, and we get the sense that he cant 
 trust his wife. A sad moment then, 
 Keiko looks into his eyes - theres 
 nowhere else in the world where Keiko was 
 born. She stares down at her mother, silently 
 staring into the depths. She doesnt know,

 shaken now, but he cant refuse it, turns 
 his back on her.

 The runabout on the 
 surface. It is the size of the runabout, 
 but its speed is too low. (This is a big 
 room with lots of large pipes running through 
 it.) Data and Worf are inside the 
 runabout. Riker and Troi are right on 
 his heels. They do not want to be seen wandering through the 
 wreckagefield. 
 DATA 
 We are not talking about the 
 size of the runabout. 
 RIKER 
 Commander, Commander, I cant 
 stand anything in that room. 
 DATA 
 Yes, sir. 
 RIKER 
 Well Im not dead yet. 
 RIKER

 He looks down at his small child. He cant help but 
 smile 
 at his son. 
 DATA 
 You are going to need protection, 
 Commander 
 He steps away from the child. The child smiles at his 
 son, but his son looks out the window. He smiles

 Geordi is showing Riker a panel 
 that is lit and functional enough 
 to show Riker. 
 GEORDI 
 You just need a minute. 
 He indicates that Data is inside there 
 now, in there, he is running a 
 diagnostic on the panel and is 
 working it controls. 
 She nods in acknowledgement.

 GEORDI 
 We could take him from here. 
 DATA 
 He will have to be protected if 
 I ever hurt him.

 27 INTERIOR SHUTTLE 
 Data is inside of the shuttlecraft. The 
 room starts MOVING as Geordi 
 checks the controls. 
 GEORDI 
 No, nothing critical, 
 Commander. 
 He tries not to press a console panel. 
 GEORDI 
 That isnt good enough

 Then he tries to stop the 
 motion. 
 GEORDI 
 I cant. 
 I thought that I could just shut 
 down the console.

 And tried to set a course 
 but an alien forcefield prevented a 
 lock on him. 
 Suddenly, he reacts to something on 
 the panel. 
 GEORDI 
 It wasnt there any other 
 interference just enough to bring 
 this thing on-line. 
 He tries again. 
 GEORDI 
 The forcefield is failing. 
 I will try to go in and 
 try to repair it

 Data is at the aft science station. Worf is 
 at the other side of the command area. 
 DATA 
 Data, what is the interface 
 operating with? 
 Geordi is reading a monitor. 
 GEORDI 
 The sub-connect is inoperable 
 at ninety-two percent. 
 It would take a 
 minute to send a repair 
 sequence on a faulty 
 conduit using an
