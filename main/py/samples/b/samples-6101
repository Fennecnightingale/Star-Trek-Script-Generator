======== SAMPLE 1 ========

 the USS Yamato is 
 on its way. 
 (beat) 
 At least we didnt lose Commander Sulu. 
 PICARD 
 Mister Data, I will 
 request information on our 
 fuel supply. 
 Data reacts to this, clearly disturbed by something. 
 DATA 
 (to Geordi) 
 I am unable to determine the 
 fuel requirement at the time 
 that the Yamato arrived at 
 coordinates X to take an intercept 
 course.

 GEORDI 
 All stop. Data, will you send 
 me the signal code for our fuel 
 needs? 
 DATA 
 Permission to speak freely is 
 not recommended. 
 Data touches the com panel again. Data reacts to 
 its command. 
 DATA 
 Bridge to Engineering. 
 (re Data) 
 Commander Data, come here. 
 Data joins him at the door. 
 DATA (V.O.) 
 I am being received from Lwaxana 
 Academy now, Commander. 
 CUT TO 
 DATA (V.O.) 
 Commanding us now. 
 35 INTERIOR ENTERPRISE - INSIDE SPOCK HOME 
 A picture of the young Picard on the monitor. A thin 
 picture of Rikers standing there watching Picard for 
 a beat. Picard is with his old friend 
 DATA (V.O.) 
 I am also receiving a letter 
 from Lwaxana Bishop of Kwejian shipkeeping 
 you prisoner. These are her 
 unofficial 
 greeting. 
 PICARD COM VOICE 
 This is Commander Data. 
 DATA 
 Yes, Lieutenant Commander. 
 PICARD COM VOICE 
 Begin with your search in this 
 sector. 
 DATA COM VOICE 
 I will be in a moment, sir. 
 We hold on the image for a beat, then 
 the screen returns to a picture of the still 
 young Picard. As Data reacts 
 DATA 
 Captain, Starfleet has confirmed 
 that my information is accurate 
 that you have sent Lwaxana 
 away.

 She died in an accident. 
 34 INTERIOR OBSERVATION LOUNGE - THE ENTERPRISE 
 BE HOLDING Riker and Data at the Aft station. 
 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 Commander Data did this. 
 DATA 
 I have no doubt it was with 
 the Yamato! I assume you had 
 reason to visit us as our guests? 
 I am also receiving a letter 
 from Lwaxana Bishop of Kwejian ship 
 VULCAN OPERATOR ONE 
 (Note She is still wearing her 
 work.) 
 BEVERLY COM VOICE 
 We need information on our 
 fuel supply, please. 
 Data moves off a few steps shy. 
 VULCAN 
 You know we need to make 
 some new sources of 
 subspace energy? 
 DATA 
 Those are two important topics. 
 It would be impudent 
 for me to suggest a search pattern, 
 particularly on my own. 
 The Aft station switches to screen, looks at the viewscreen 
 as Data moves off. Suddenly -
