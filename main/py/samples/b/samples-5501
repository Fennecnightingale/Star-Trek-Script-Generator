isk not always have to worry about him. 
 Odo cant understand why she brought him here. 
 OOSKAL 
 Well, I guess we are not exactly cleared to 
 everything here. I assure you, Constable, we have, 
 truly, uh, met the changeling before. 
 KIRA 
 (smiles) 
 I will see you in a few seconds. 
 Ooskal nods, thats all, 
 thats all. Odo moves toward door, but first Kari 
 makes a stop by the looks and pulls his knife out 
 of his waiting hand. Kari moves back in time, sees the knife in the 
 hand. 
 KIRA 
 What have you got? 
 Odo holds the knife straight at Dukat, but Kari gets 
 him back and shoves the mans knife out 
 Kari grabs the manacles and pours the wine himself into a glass 
 SPOCK 
 (holding his knife) 
 Not much. 
 KIRA 
 We would appreciate anything you got 
 about the nature of your weapon. 
 Odo smiles, and they exchange a "what is with you isnt 
 ours to decide") 
 KIRA 
 The fact that we have never been to 
 any inhabited world 
 KIRA 
 (nodding) 
 Oh. I can see. 
 (with an edge) 
 I remember the first time I was on a shuttle. 
 KIRA 
 (with an edge) 
 You were a real beauty. 
 Odo smiles, acknowledging the fact that he was able to 
 outlast Shakaar.

 On an desolate plain, where the landscape is landscape 
 Kari foraged its the centerpiece of an immense wall-hanging in the 
 foliage an obelisk of some sort to symbol the 
 significance of "The Changeling" the emblem represents 
 Krios 
 "The Changeling" is the emblem of a symbol of life, the 
 emblem of a symbol of liberty and equality. Kari 
 could have simply chosen the emblem. 
 KIRA 
 No, no, no. The emblem of 
 AR-558 represents liberty and the 
 planet, or at least its one of them. 
 KIRA 
 Could it be the emblem of a community 
 organization or even an alliance that 
 united the community and would 
 support it?

 Odo looks disappointed, but Kari has not even 
 to think about it. 
 KALITA 
 The Changeling was not my 
 thinking. 
 KIRA 
 Im sorry, there are times when I 
 should have thought of you as 
 a person 
 KALITA 
 Just answer two. 
 KALITA 
 Im aware of that distinction. I had 
 to choose between loyalty and heresy, and I 
 chose neither. 
 KALITA 
 (with an edge) 
 Thats a mistake for you. To live 
 after five years in the Changeling, 
 you are going to have to answer 
 three, four, three. 
 And off Karios face, we

 Report on this, sir. My

 We must proceed with the plan ahead. 
 KALITA 
 Very well, Constable. Proceed. 
 Worf reacts with interest. 
 WORF COM VOICE 
 Proceed. The Changeling has asked for subspace 
 transceiver.
