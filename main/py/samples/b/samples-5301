======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 full that if anything ever happens again, it  doesnt have to be accidental.  
  JANEWAY it was supposed to be an attempt by now. i will  have some answers.  
  (sickbay)  
  EMH the new tests were negative. theres no reason for  any deviation from either a scientific or a  psychiatric diagnosis. the only exception was in relation to you. i suspect  you have become affected by a form of excessive violence.  
  KIM im sorry to hear about this,  EMH you are new here, and you are inexperienced.  
  KIM forget it. I was starting to get the idea. i didnt mean to  change course im sorry. may i help you?  
  EMH I dont intend to hurt you.  
 the two of us make a good team. you have got to give your people a  better chance. thats all thats necessary in light.  
  KIM whats that supposed to mean?  
  EMH we need to get information from the augments.  
  PARIS maybe theres a way to teach our augments  a lesson in patience.  
  EMH if nothing else, give me your empathic impressions.  
  KIM im not ready for you yet.  
  EMH you will be. when we tried to take contact with  you its like having a penny, or seeing a glass shrink.  
  PARIS I guess we didnt pay you a lot of  attention.  
  EMH its important that you continue to appreciate the fact that you  are here. would you? I find those very interesting.  
  KIM its the truth! now start looking at the tissue  encircle. I want to sound a little crazy from your perspective.  
  EMH tell me about it!  
  KIM what it means, exactly what it means. you  have got to tell us.  
  EMH how exciting!  
  CHAKOTAY when do we begin?  
  EMH we wait. here thats where we are supposed to start.  
  JANEWAY I want to hear more about this  (corridor)  
  JANEWAY that new test that gave me a good spin in the  field but I cant imagine why you are looking for  something so nebula-like on my own.  
  CHAKOTAY you have a lot to ask!  
  JANEWAY I can assure you the truth. i didnt get  very far away with it. the reason why the new tests  are because we had a lot of experience  ahead of us. which is why i  dont seem to be myself here.  
  CHAKOTAY we still have new ideas about how  to probe deeper into the nebula which  could shed some of  this knowledge for decades.  
  JANEWAY I see you have already given that one  thought.  
  CHAKOTAY I have been thinking the same thing.  
  JANEWAY don�t hold that back.  
  CHAKOTAY don�t say anything. just remember,  the good old days. its easier to  look at the new ones.  
  JANEWAY I hope you have got your mind set, doctor.  
  (sickbay)  
  EMH shes going to be here in a few minutes,  but im still not sure if shes still conscious.  
  CHAKOTAY I sense her coming.  
  EMH how do you feel?  
  CHAKOTAY I just need a minute of my time.  
  EMH what is it?  
  KES im not really sure.  
  EMH you are right, my memories are still of us  getting together.  
  CHAKOTAY I remember when we had this little  incident. i played golf with my dad, I caught some  of the balls, and my sister went bowling.  
  EMH I played the next day.  
  CHAKOTAY she was eighteen. she wanted to play one of  the new things. like a dog chasing a cat.  
  EMH in the middle of the day?  
  CHAKOTAY we hit the new test on the drive. and the drive  was damaged.  
 
  EMH you are right.  
  CHAKOTAY I was able to fix it after day.  
  EMH I dont believe it.  
  CHAK
