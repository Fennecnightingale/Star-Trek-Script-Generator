JOV 
 I have already. My hand is at the pulse of the 
 neutronium-rich substance. 
 (beat) 
 Can we do it again? 
 COMPUTER VOICE 
 Not yet. The power drain is too 
 too much. 
 Picard exits the turbolift, sighs deeply. 
 PICARD 
 You have got yourself. Let me 
 take it. 
 PICARD 
 I can do the job. 
 Riker moves to the transporter room and opens the 
 door there is a long beat of tension before the door can be 
 fully shutened and the security guards and security guards emerge. 
 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 Computer, lock onto this 
 position 
 DATA COM VOICE 
 A few positional equations from 
 a multi-spatial array is ready. 
 PICARD 
 Is there a course correction? 
 DATA COM VOICE 
 Yes, sir. 
 PICARD 
 Then, how is the Enterprise able to out-comp? 
 COMPUTER VOICE 
 This ship contains three-dimensional equations. 
 And when the equations are applied for collision with 
 the stars 
 PICARD 
 The holo-board is equipped with the capability of storing 
 and compressing the equations for decussing 
 the trajectories of the trajectories. 
 TRUL is in the cargo bay. She is trying to be sure. 
 GEORDI 
 Is it safe? 
 PICARD

 Im a starship.

 the missing people on an away mission as the USS 
 tries to find a way home, while an away mission has become a 
 priority. 
 17 INTERIOR DATA QUARTERS - ON DOCCY (OPTICAL) 
 Data is in the room and the computer monitor is on 
 the desktops he is seated at the desk station where he is talking 
 about their capabilities 
 DATA 
 I am running simulations of the 
 trajectory. They are 
 simulations of my first 
 entry into the Ferengi. 
 DATA 
 We simulated the flight 
 path of the Ferengi Bird of 
 the Bird of Prey. 
 DATA 
 Then you can understand that it is our first 
 entry into their wormhole and you will 
 not forget that the Ferengi have 
 not done. 
 DATA 
 They have never been interested in Ferengi 
 behavior we are not talking about the Ferengi 
 
 DATA 
 (nods) 
 Yes 
 DATA 
 I was an example of how the crew had 
 reacted in your situation. 
 DATA 
 Yes, sir but it was not a success. 
 DATA 
 We are not trying to solve any of 
 our problems by playing games. Computer, 
 scan and analyze.

 The Ferengi arent here, but they are 
 here. 
 Picard and Troi EXIT Data and the door closes. 
 18A INTERIOR DATA QUARTERS 
 DATA is talking to him there is a large, sprawling room and a large
