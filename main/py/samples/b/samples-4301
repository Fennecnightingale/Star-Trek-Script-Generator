 LARG What is your point? 
 LARG I just have to look at 
 LARG You want to talk about it. 
 LARG What is that?

 forgotten the incident? 
 LARG No. 
 LARG Its a little difficult to grasp, but I have to 
 remind you of this. LARG Thats not a likely scenario. 
 LARG No! (growling) 
 LARG It doesnt mean they are going to come just 
 as soon as they came. 
 LARG Thats right, LARG Im going over every detail of every 
 contingency. 
 LARG I will be back. 
 LARG Oh, you will. But you are probably not. 
 LARG I will talk to them. Maybe they will help you find whatever it is. But, 
 LARG Thats not exactly what I wanted. 
 LARG Its better than my original plan. 
 LARG What about you? 
 LARG Oh, LARG You have such strong senses that you can see 
 everything and everything else you are not supposed to have ever grown up 
 LARG I have realized that our problems are connected somehow 
 LARG If this is about our father, then what is so far?

 are the same things they are always so far away. 
 LARG Its like your home. 
 LARG Oh. You know Im afraid that home may 
 destroy you. 
 LARG Thats why I love you. 
 LARG It is. And so I just tried to destroy it when I 
 had trouble. 
 LARG Are you saying you wont do the same thing to yourself? 
 LARG Im saying that it must have been a mistake. 
 LARG Why? 
 LARG What you are saying is that if you have any problems in 
 there, you are going to be unhappy. Its something you may try to avoid. 
 LARG I was thinking of the things I said in there. 
 LARG Oh! Ah! And the places I was going there. 
 LARG These are all the apartments, its the only one. 
 LARG Where was I going? 
 LARG You said you wanted to explore every 
 possibility. 
 LARG Maybe I thought I was excited.
