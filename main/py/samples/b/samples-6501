 Theres a pause as Worf is taken aback by the sudden 
 revelation. 
 WORF 
 Sir? 
 He turns toward Bashir. The captain has never raised his 
 eyes, let alone spoken. 
 WORF 
 (quiet, but firm) 
 I was there and I will see to it that 
 we use the information 
 obtained by our 
 intelligence agencies. And that will 
 allow us to obtain the 
 information.

 The ship at warp. 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Behind the Lines" - 3/11/98 - ACT TWO 19. 
 21 INTERIOR SISKO QUARTERS 
 Sisko is at his desk, working the PADD he was 
 working at in his office. Suddenly the DOOR CHIME 
 SOUNDS. 
 SISKO 
 Enter. 
 Jake ENTERS the room with the dune eyes 
 of a Grand Nagus. Hes a bit lower 
 has one eye, slightly slimmery, slightly disoriented, as 
 always - but for him, totally and completely naked. 
 But there is a definite vulnerability beneath 
 Siskos facade as well as a slight vulnerability 
 in his attitude on the occasion. In spite of Siskos 
 cool and laid back persona, hes a little slow 
 and cerebral. 
 He stands and quickly motions to the bar Sisko 
 begins to set down a PADD. As Sisko works 
 the PADD 
 SISKO 
 (to Gaila) 
 Lieutenant Cole here 
 Gaila suddenly moves to the side, sitting on the edge of a 
 swing raised by one and all while its not swinging in the 
 way. 
 Gaila throws Sisko a PADD and smiles at him. 
 Gaila looks around and heads back to her seat on the couch 
 with the lounge area as the TROI 
 ENTER 
 Gaila looks around in the general, then settles on a new 
 spot on the couch. 
 Gaila moves to the lounge area and sits down 
 with a weary look on her face. 
 Gaila looks around, realizes shes 
 alone here and shes a little fragile 
 here. Shes worked with people 
 for a few years, if thats an 
 acceptable market, shes willing 
 to start having a hard time alone on 
 this mission. 
 SISKO 
 (reacts) 
 A hologram? 
 Gaila looks around, settles in a new location and 
 pulls out a Sisko PADD. She hands it to Sisko, who has already seen 
 this PADD when she speaks to Bashir.

 21 CONTINUED 
 GILMORE 
 I havent seen you in a week 
 SISKO 
 You 
 (turns to Odo) 
 This doesnt sound like you. 
 GILMORE 
 (to Dax) 
 The bar does have half a half-dozen 
 customers 
 Sisko takes in his first foray into self-explation that 
 way, but the salesman and his average 
 clientele are both professional and very 
 happy 
 GILMORE 
 Thats a small minority in 
 a good sense 
 (now looking at Sisko, with an 
 edge) 
 This is our chance for business. 
 (off their reactions) 
 You know, as I was saying, theres been 
 some off-the-blue loose-head since 
 you left the station. Weve lost 
 a few, but there are people 
 still looking for us out there. 
 (off their reactions) 
 Is there a limit to "what they can do to 
 eat, sell, just start 
 to think about it 
 Sisko cant lie 
 GILMORE 
 What limits to what people 
 could eat when their next meal? 
 They both take out one of their steaks and put 
 two glasses of kanar on ice. Jake sits 
 down, weighs the situation, realizes theres just one 
 option. 
 JAKE 
 What can you tell me about 
 us? Where does this really begin? 
 GILMORE 
 You are beginning to annoy me. 
 (beat) 
 The bar is very basic 
 really just as with these three 
 dimensional dimensions. A
