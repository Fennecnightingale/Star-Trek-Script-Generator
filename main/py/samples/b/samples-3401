 Riker stares at him. 
 RIKER 
 What are you saying, Worf? 
 WORF 
 I have analyzed your stellar 
 structure and discovered the 
 signatures for 
 (he is pointing at 
 the bright side of 
 the face) 
 it appears our people have been 
 instrumental in the past. 
 Riker pauses before this point, but as the 
 point continues, he is unable to say that 
 hes deeply troubled. 
 RIKER 
 What caused the power failure? 
 WORF 
 It has a complex reaction pattern. 
 Riker pauses, looks at her. 
 PICARD 
 Worf, do you know what it is? 
 WORF 
 No, sir. We are just here. 
 At this point, I have no thought 
 of a solution in our 
 minds.

 RIKER 
 Worf, what is it you have 
 always wanted for, Worf? To 
 share the truth of the mind. 
 At this point in the conversation that Captain 
 can see a great deal of truth, almost 
 the exact opposite of what he has to 
 say. He sees it isnt an option, but he 
 pushes it. 
 RIKER 
 Worf, I wish I could go along. 
 Worf nods. The others all have as much 
 fear of this as they are.

 24 INTERIOR ENGINEERING 
 Worf is in the middle of a console when Worf enters. 
 WORF 
 (off console) 
 The field strength is down, Mister 
 Worf. 
 WESLEY (O.S.) 
 Thats it! The power has just 
 dropped off main engines! 
 Worf is alarmed. 
 WORF 
 You mean we have just lost the power 
 matrix? 
 WORF 
 No. We are still working, sir. 
 And on Worfs face of determination, as we

 Worf turns to see Ensign Strickling looking around.

 WESLEY 
 I just found some kind of plasma conduit 
 off-line, sir. Its just one. Its 
 
 been too many. 
 The Ensign says this with a grim expression. 
 ABOVE THE TRANSMISSION 
 (VIDEO) 
 It is a power surge on the conduit deck, sir. 
 Its going to overload the 
 containment 
 field and I cant get a lock without 
 it! 
 (starts computer) 
 It appears our power transfer has 
 terminated, sir. 
 The engineering console goes down. 
 WORF 
 (off console) 
 The power field is 
 destabilizing. We are all 
 going to power up. 
 (sits down in his seat) 
 What happened, sir? 
 In a technical state of matter 
 conversion, this conduit is going 
 "whiz." 
 The Ensign gets up, gets to face his console.

 WESLEY 
 (off console) 
 We have lost the containment 
 field! 
 (off console) 
 I saw some kind of plasma conduit! 
 The conduit is still unstable! 
 (off console) 
 Captain? 
 The Ensign starts working. 
 26 INTERIOR ENGINEERING (OPTICAL) 
 In a state of temporal synch with that 
 power fluctuating near the conduit. The conduit is 
 going mad! 
 Worf is working it console. 
 37 INTERIOR MAIN BRIDGE 
 Somewhere beyond the bridge is a forcefield (not 
 on the main console). 
 RIKER COM VOICE 
 I will let you know in an hour. 
 PICARD 
 (to com) 
 Mister Worf, initiate a 
 power transfer of the 
 temporal conduit. 
 Worf looks puzzled. 
 DATA 
 I assume you are not going to 
 control the power transfer? 
 He seems to be saying the time field
