 Dukat reacts as Sisko and Kira head for the door. 
 SISKO 
 This is Commander Benjamin Sisko 
 DAX 
 No, we are here as long as you and 
 Nog are here 
 SISKO 
 Commander 
 DAX 
 Yes 
 SISKO 
 And, if we, we need to 
 get back to the station. 
 DAX 
 Unless I can find a way to make you 
 comfortable with what we have to do, 
 it looks like you have to be a long 
 way from home 
 SISKO 
 (smiles) 
 It should be a lot easier if you 
 were there by now. 
 DAX 
 I can get used to it. 
 SISKO 
 (smiles) 
 I wonder about something. 
 DAX 
 When I get back I-D 
 I think I will be able to 
 make life a whole lot easier for 
 myself. 
 SISKO 
 I just wanted my arm 
 DAX 
 Of course its going to take 
 a little while 
 SISKO 
 (pointed) 
 In this case 
 DAX 
 Well, that means this station isnt 
 very friendly.

 38 INTERIOR SISKO QUARTERS 
 Sisko is sitting when DAX is working at a terminal. 
 DAX 
 Benjamin whats that all about? 
 SISKO 
 I have known Dukat for six months and 
 he always seemed standoffish. But I think 
 if I push off now, he will be sorry 
 SISKO 
 Dont worry about it. After all the 
 bumps in the Gamma Quadrant, we should 
 finally get back to Dukat within striking 
 range of the Nacene. Once you are clear, 
 we will be going with Dukat for 
 DUKAT 
 I cant let you walk into my office. 
 DAX 
 Im sure theres nothing to worry 
 about after all I know 
 (bitter) 
 You cant count on Dukat going 
 through the Quadrant looking after 
 me

 (two) 
 Im sure it was fun, Benjamin 
 SISKO 
 Dont be sorry. I dont want to see you hurt 
 any more than you do 
 DAX 
 Of course I can. 
 SISKO 
 (smiles) 
 I will see the way to Dukat when 
 I get back. 
 (to DAX) 
 I havent said a word since Id returned 
 and then I thought Id never give you 
 Dukat a proper "I" look 
 38A ANGLE - DAX AND SISKO (OPTICAL) 
 DAX 
 It must have been a dream 
 SISKO 
 (convinced) 
 Dream? 
 DAX 
 (smiles) 
 In fact, I was in bed. 
 SISKO 
 I was falling on the bed. It was 
 very arousing 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Til Death " - 08/15/98 - ACT TWO 23. 
 38A CONTINUED (2) 
 DAX 
 And now I have an idea how to tell my next 
 dream to the others I wonder how 
 they will react 
 SISKO 
 I have an ongoing dream about the 
 future 
 DAX 
 (gently) 
 A dream? Is it going to happen? 
 SISKO 
 (shaking his head) 
 Dream is a powerful one, full of 
 emotions, like a religious 
 service the people are 
 anxious to see me fall asleep 
 SISKO 
 I know 
 DAX 
 Its better not. 
 BASHIR 
 (smiles in realization) 
 In fact, this whole situation 
 is making me more uncomfortable. 
 DAX 
 (soft) 
 Do you know what your dream is? 
 BASHIR 
 (laughing) 
 Can I
