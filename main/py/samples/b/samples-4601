======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 We the (incoming). 
 TRAVIS Could have just been 
 standing by herself for 
 CHANGELLETT They are getting too small to move around. 
 DANIK No. It is possible they are being driven back by 
 Romulans. 
 TRAVIS We can just confirm that they are in a location to the 
 north-west, sir. 
 (Bridge) 
 REED I have run an analysis of the scans of the Romulan shuttle. 
 Its travelling at warp factor eight. 
 HOSHI They are holding their shields at their first speed. 
 TRAVIS Their weapons are down and running. 
 ARCHER (OC) The Captain says he will be waiting for us to get back 
 here. 
 TUCKER Why would they not answer to us? 
 TRAVIS Maybe they have better not to. 
 TUCKER Not if we are going to go north and try to rescue them. 
 (Romulan shuttle) 
 TRAVIS They are getting out of here. 
 FORREST Are you sure you can convince them? 
 TRAVIS I dont have much of a choice. 
 FORREST If you can persuade them, you can convince them. You need to 
 do things like that. 
 TRAVIS I will talk to them. I will negotiate with my Captain. 
 (Bridge) 
 HOSHI Hull platings back online. 
 (Romulan shuttlecraft) 
 TRAVIS Captain, a shuttle-craft is departing. Its heading to a 
 rendezvous with Starfleet. 
 UHURA (OC) All hands to battle stations. Prepare for the assault. 
 TRAVIS On my way. 
 (Romulan shuttlecraft) 
 TRAVIS (OC) Its a shuttlecraft. I will meet up with the landing party. 
 FORREST No. They are not responding. 
 TRAVIS They have not responded to our hailing. 
 FORREST No change. They havent touched us. 
 (Narahr bursts through, leaving the two pilots talking in the shuttlepods, 
 etc.) 
 HOSHI Hull platings down. We are taking damage to this shuttlecraft. 
 TRAVIS Thats more than just a bad thing. Try to get away from it. 
 (Tucker gets his attention in the shuttlepods.) 
 TUCKER If I can find a way to speed the shuttlepods down, then we can come out firing. 
 (The shuttlepods through.) 
 TUCKER If you are willing to risk taking some risk in getting to that shuttlepods. 
 TRAVIS I was talking about theres a shuttlepods down and Im not going back. 
 (Romulan shuttlepods off. The Enterprise comes out of the nebula to search for its 
 space) 
 (Bridge) 
 TUCKER Im telling you, somethings interfering with the shuttlepods warp trail. 
 TPOL I will attempt to isolate them. 
 TUCKER Did they say what they were doing? 
 TPOL Likely. Something from our own shuttlecraft? 
 TUCKER I called that a little closer. 
 TPOL Im not certain. 
 TUCKER They say they have disabled that shuttlepods, all right? 
 TPOL Lieutenant Reed told me he was in charge of shutting down the shuttlepods warp drive 
 from Vulcan at Starfleet Command. 
 TUCKER Well, lets not know what happened to that shuttle. I guess we will have 
 for a change. You are the Commander. Do you want to go back back to Vulcan? 
 TPOL Are there any other Romulans on that ship? 
 TUCKER What was a Romulan shuttlepods been missing? If they were looking for a way home, we all would have 
 tried a rescue by now. 
 TPOL Im disappointed to learn. I suppose that was the reason you picked him. 
 TUCKER We have got to talk. It looks like he has more than a 
 Romulan vessel. Hes trying to find a way to steer us back through that nebula. 
 TPOL He has damaged three decks. 
 TUCKER Three so badly. We just want him back. 
 TPOL Theres no other way. 
 TUCKER Why not? 
 TUCKER Come on, get me some help. 
 (Romulan shuttlepod) 
 ARCHER Whats going on? 
 TUCKER (OC) I just had to fly through the atmosphere. Would guess you are feeling better? 
 FORREST Can we just land in Romulan space? 
 TUCK
