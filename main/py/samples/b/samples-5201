 T (OPTICAL) 
 in orbit, monitoring a remote sector in the Demilitarized Zone- 
 being monitored by four JemHadar warships. 
 WEYOUN 
 Major Kira was in command of the 
 Federation fleet when the attack took 
 place. She was no 
 longer a ship commander. 
 VULCAN 
 (harsh) 
 Are you dismissing this baseless 
 rumor? 
 WEYOUN 
 Im serious. 
 VULCAN 
 Then how did you know Kira was 
 here? She never would have 
 believed that if Starfleet Command 
 actually gave a hand over, 
 I had to sweep up her 
 files just to find new ways to 
 counter those effects 
 There is a general buzz in the room as the conversation 
 ends. 
 OBRIEN 
 Major Kiras memory it was 
 over a year ago, before 
 she knew what happened 
 to her when we left the anomaly. 
 Weyoun flashes OBrien up and down 
 the scale as if expecting a response. 
 WEYOUN 
 (continuing) 
 But that was the end of the 
 danger, and thats why 
 she needed to keep the shuttle up 
 and running, right as Commander 
 Riker was also badly damaged 
 by the Klingons a year later. 
 VULCAN 
 Interesting. You will not get 
 that chance, Chief. 
 26 ANGLE ON SISKO 
 He tries to be diplomatic, but it is obvious 
 he has no choice. 
 SISKO 
 Are you telling me that the shuttle was 
 intentionally attacked? 
 The lights suddenly DIMINING a few areas in 
 the room due to the shuttle being 
 "captained" we never see a 
 JemHadar fighter. (But I will 
 see you fight them with impunity 
 as long as you are willing to do it) 
 SISKO 
 Are you kidding? I thought you were 
 one of the greatest 
 strategists of the past 
 to me, and that you are the 
 prime suspect in this 
 deception. What 
 should I do, Major? See how many 
 JemHadar soldiers 
 die over us? I cannot 
 take sides in battle faster 
 than you can. I dont want 
 anything to get to or from 
 me. 
 And out of earshot.

 29A INTERIOR DEFIANT BRIDGE (SECOND LEVEL) 
 OBrien and Keiko watching the conversation and the two 
 admirals exchange their faces. They have a serious 
 look on Keikos tone this time 
 KIRA 
 Its over, OBrien. You are 
 underestimating the size of that 
 ship thats capable of warp 
 speed and maneuverability 
 OBRIEN 
 What it will be when we get back? 
 Kira reacts, not sure how to bring up their 
 thoughts 
 KIRA 
 (continuing) 
 We have no choice. 
 Keiko reacts as if shes the only ones not sure 
 exactly what to hear 
 KIRA 
 Thats not true 
 (to Sisko) 
 I agree with Mister Weyoun. 
 KIRA 
 What does it mean? 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Starship Down" - 03/01/96 - ACT TWO 24. 
 29A CONTINUED 
 SISKO 
 It means we are going to have to 
 follow a blockade to get into 
 the Gamma. 
 KIRA 
 Its not that simple 
 Keiko looks to see her a little stern, 
 but it is a shes in no mood to push 
 Sisko over 
 KIRA 
 You are not leaving unless we 
 stop the traffic. Thats the 
 reason we have to work together 
 to prevent it from happening in the future 
 SISKO 
 (hard) 
 The only people who can be trusted to 
 stop the traffic 
 (beat, and to 
 Keiko) 
 are you and Worf. And 
 Kira and Sisko exchange glances 
 KIRA 
 (moving to stand for 
 them to back) 
 Get in there 
 And Kira and Sisko EXIT in followed by Sisko and Worf. As they 
 disappear, Kei and Worf also 
 OMITTED 
 FADE OUT. 
 END OF ACT TWO
