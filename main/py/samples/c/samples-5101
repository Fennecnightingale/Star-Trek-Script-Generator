t, as we did with
a positronic impulse. It may be possible to enhance
the synaptic functions.
TPOL Theres nothing to be gained by the procedure.
JANEWAY Are you proposing a mind meld?
TPOL Im not talking about a hypothetical exercise.
JANEWAY What if we isolate the parts of the brain apart.
We cant use them as a way to communicate with them.
TUVOK The risk is mine to take.

(Holodeck - Starlings office)

STARLING We are talking about a different procedure. Think of it as a
paranoia. The mycelialization. Or its people who I want to talk to.
PARIS I dont want to talk to a holodeck character. (to myself) Why bother. I dont
want to be under some alien influence. The alien being
was responsible for the accident which nearly killed my husband. Think, maybe we should
work together.
STARLING I have a suspicion that you are making up more
than you are thinking.
PARIS What are you doing here?
STARLING I knew you couldnt be the
Starling officer who brought it onto us. What is it?
PARIS Well.
STARLING That I was told the procedure didnt make
any sense. Why didnt you ask me to do that?
PARIS I dont expect a lecture. Think. Whos you talking
to here?
STARLING Im sorry. (puts it quietly) You have nothing to be
the mycelializer.
PARIS Well, whatever it is you want, lets do it.
ERIKA (on monitor) This was the Captain. We
cant go, Captain. You have done enough. I think we can just call
a truce and go home.
STARLING You are mistaken.
PARIS I have enough of you to keep this up.
STARLING We dont have time for one. We have to get out
of here.
PARIS You are going to have to get creative.
STARLING I will try.
PARIS I have to try, Doctor.
STARLING If you want to continue our relationship I advise against it.
PARIS I dont want to do that.
ERIKA (on monitor) What happened to us?
TUVOK (OC) We were ambushed by three unidentified
life signs. Our security teams require time to retrieve them.
PARIS Tumeless.
TUVOK (OC) After suffering a physical injury, we must locate
one of the life.
PARIS If you want information to help you, Doctor, ask Doctor.
TUVOK (OC) We are well-mannered.
PARIS What are they doing out here, this is a Starfleet ship.
TUVOK (OC) You are free to go.
TUVOK (OC) It is advisable for you to remain here at this
station until we can retrieve the cargo.
PARIS Again! Arent you ridiculous.
TUVOK (OC) There is no reason to
PARIS Doctor, I think you should try to rest.
TUVOK (OC) You are a very patient, Doctor.
PARIS Just rest, Doctor.
TUVOK (OC) Do not threaten me.
HOSHI Doctor?
JANEWAY How is she?
EMH Shes fine, Captain.
EMH The trauma the body has caused some kind of DNA mutation. Shes been
stacked up like an ice to hold all her wounds.
JANEWAY Shes perfectly healthy.
EMH Captain, you do the best you can. Doctor, the DNA has
been incorporated into your body. You are not part of this.
JANEWAY Shes perfectly healthy, Doctor.
EMH Doctor to Bridge. Shes being projected from inside the body.
JANEWAY A temporary hologram of a hologram.
EMH (translated) Hello.
EMH Im seeking permission to conduct a little experiment on
your own. A few months back, dear Horrible Doctor, you lost me. Why
havent you called me?
JANEWAY Forgive for a moment, Doctor â€“ we are in the war with the
Kazon. You have no right to put our security into the hands of
your own people until an investigation is complete.
EMH To what end?
JANEWAY If you dont mind, Id like to get to the Bridge and I
have a look at what you have found. All of your information should be
reported to Mister Tom Carrington.
EMH He is an independent scout - unlike the government. In fact, his
information is quite selective.
JANEWAY I have already reported information you
