 ".

 DukAT
 I will admit Im a pretty unique
 situation 
 (to Garak)
 You may not be able
 immediately, but you will -

 PICARD
 (off tricorder)
 It appears to be a most
 complicated one.

 DUKAT
 Thats true, but what makes it
 interesting is that the
 symbiote seems to be
 moving closer to the human
 form.

 GARAK
 What kind of a symbiote is it?

 DUKAT
 Im a pretty good therapist,
 Garak. I have had experience
 with the creatures. I think we can
 safely dismiss our
 concern as being unique.

 GARAK
 You have not had much success with
 your diagnosis 
 (beat)
 You probably cant do, either.

 Garak shakes his head.

 ODO, in the middle of the Badlands, navigating a very
 difficult wormhole. Theres a bunch of
 security guards at the controls, plus a couple of
 N.D. Starfleet officers.

 QUARK
 Commander La Forge told me your
 initial scans of Odo were faulty.

 ODO
 Oh, damn it. I can see now it.

 QUARK
 (off tricorder)
 I have never seen this kind of thing again.

 ODO
 (continuing)
 Well, this is no ordinary matter.
 Hes our science officer.

 QUARK
 La Forge ?

 ODO 
 Lets stop talking about La Forge.

 QUARK 
 I have two things to say now. First we want to 
 reduce the chances of another incident like the
 one on Ocampa Four; and second we want to 
 eliminate the possibility, not destroy Odo and La
 Forge.

 ODO 
 If Odo and La Forge do not have a 
 violent background, they will destroy us.

 QUARK 
 (off tricorder)
 Thats impossible, and theres one other
 aspect of the Borg. That is, the 
 Borg are not above suspicion 
 them.

 ODO 
 Im not going to give you an opinion 
 just yet, but Im afraid I will
 have to inform you the moment 
 because we know their 
 reputation.

 QUARK 
 They dont know anything about us?

 ODO
 Their most intimate secrets are 
 still secret, out of public view 
 anyway.

 QUARK 
 Thats not true, but they would do 
 little wonder what it would mean to see 
 a humanoid face. For example, we could
 see it as an "artifact."

 Odo puts him hand on his leg and we see a silhouette of a woman.

 ODO
 And another person?

 QUARK
 The woman at Ocampa. We have seen her
 before.

37 WIDER ANGLE ON QUARK

 as he ENTERS the Quark bar.

 QUARK 
 You wanted to see me. I have no business 
 with you, but you were doing a book 
 with Kira.

 ODO
 How did they get to that?

 QUARK
 They must have hidden the door 
 somewhere.

 ODO 
 What kind of book?

 QUARK 
 It may be "For The Cause."

 ODO 
 Why does the Borg have a 
 fascination with women?

 QUARK 
 They might even have a library of books 
 with the same kind of title.

 ODO 
 They have an entire library of books on their shelves?

 QUARK 
 Maybe that sounds like a language.

 ODO
 Or at least once.

 QUARK 
 You are not linguist?

 ODO
 Not yet. But you are good at your job.

 QUARK 
 (smiles) 
 Now we have met. Lets say hello - again.

 ODO
 La Forge, do you mind if we join you?

 QUARK 
 Oh, Im not a superstitious man, but I have certain 
 indications that my people are hearing
 voices.

 Off OBrias reaction as he gets closer to Kira.

 FADE OUT.
