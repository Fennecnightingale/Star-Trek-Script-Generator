======== SAMPLE 1 ========
AK, I will meet you in the Mess
 Office shortly.

 RIKER
 Is there a problem?

 BEVERLY
 They cant seem to hear your
 signal.

 RIKER
 Keep trying.

 They continue to work.

 BEVERLY
 I cant get through - they
 dont understand.

 They reach the door.

 BEVERLY
 I cant get through - they
 cant stop me.

 Picard thinks for a moment tries and bang
 it with his head. Then he opens the
 door.

 PICARD
 Then I think you can keep the
 ventral.

 BEVERLY
 I dont totally lose control
 there. But I know the situation
 with you and I know you are
 on board this ship. I know
 you have some friends on board.

 PICARD
 Not friends, friends. I
 think there is someone I want
 you to know.
 (beat)
 The Captain. I trust that when
 Im alone for more than thirty
 minutes, you are going to want
 something personal about
 yourself.

 There is a beat as Beverly considers a long beat then glances
 around the camp for survival.

 BEVERLY
 Something of course theres
 to be said about personal
 intimacy.

 PICARD
 Its too late for that.
 I will know it when I hear you.

 She seems to be beginning to realize just whats on her
 mind.

 BEVERLY
 Im in the hands of men like you
 who dont give up easily 

 Beverly regards him for a moment, then smiles and
 heads for the door. Picard follows the
 sound of her door and looks into her eyes
 she seems even more pleased than ever with him. The
 intimacy becomes and real.

 BEVERLY
 I didnt think so either.

 PICARD
 I hope I didnt interrupt, but
 it did take me a few
 moments to realize it.

 BEVERLY
 I know.

 As they walk back to Beverlys room 

 BEVERLY
 (continues)
 I think I will take care of this
.

 Beverly nods, and EXITS. Picard moves back
 into her room

 Beverly and CUT TO

 BEVERLY
 I know better than you do how difficult it
 was for me to get there.
 There are so many things I
 cant do.

 CUT TO

29 INTERIOR TURBOLIFT

 Picard and Riker are on the lift, but Beverly is already
 behind them.

 PICARD
 I know it must seem overwhelming.

 RIKER
 You have a plan, bro.

 PICARD
 You had the Foreman do the
 Transporter Room.

 Picard nods his understanding.

 RIKER
 We just need a little more time.

 PICARD
 How much longer would it take you to bring
 the ship up you can do?

 Picard smiles sagelyly.

 PICARD
 We will get around it within a
 couple of hours it should be
 within the other two
 hours.

 RIKER
 (heating)
 So.

 The lift starts MOVING.

 Picard reacts, pleased.

 PICARD
 We will get there in a few
 hours 

 RIKER
 I heard the Captain.
 That wont be long.

 BEVERLY
 (meeting chief)
 You think the best thing
 to do is take the
 ship home 

 Picard nods this.

 Picard nods in acknowledgement of the fact that
 this is easier for him. Data begins to
 stand. Picard eyes him, then seems to be
 satisfied that they are working the proper
 thing.

 BEVERLY
 (to Riker)
 Thats my ship and my duty.

 RIKER
 (amused)
 What is it you want? What
 do you want? What else?

 BEVERLY
 Its the middle of time. The
 Earth, we all have the same
 history.
