 own. You will be all right there.

 LASCA
 (benevinced)
 What good is a lifetime ban. You know, Im
 sure I got your co-operation.

 WESLEY
 A joke, but you are
 quite serious.

 LASCA
 Then maybe you should take me up
 your invitation.

 Wesley steps up to them.

 WESLEY
 (to Wesley)
 How about a beer?

 Wesley steps up to them, holds Lasca feet off and
 begins to wriggle. Lacca stands watch the
 two friends come over to Lara, whos not amused. They
 can barely contain themselves to do it.

 LARA
 (trying to be casual)
 But I hope you wont 

 WESLEY
 I cant do that.

 And in the hunker, Wesley steps up to Wesley - he has
 a great deal to talk about all this. He is a little more
 forceful, and he knows what to expect.

 WESLEY
 You are not the only one. The Captain
 has talked with the Prime
 Minister.

 LARA
 And then her ship crashed 

 WESLEY
 And his ship was destroyed by our
 enemy.

 LARA
 (to Wesley)
 You mean our wars? Well that may
 change the situation, but it doesnt affect your
 decisions.

 Wesley makes his best effort to cut in.

 WESLEY
 If you wish, Commander, whatever you want. If you want
 to play this games with me, you will have
 to try harder than it was
 your first mission.

 LARA
 (to Wesley)
 Hes trying to "play" this game
 too.

 Wesley knows not to be in his enemies shoes.

 WESLEY
 (to Lara)
 Commander, please. If you wont,
 you will never get the captain off of
 here alive.

 LARA
 I can control him. I can control. You know
 I like your game. You like my
 game.

 Wesley thinks about this for a moment. A beat. Then, a decision is
 reached.

 WESLEY
 (to Lara)
 But this game is your
 game. You should enjoy it,
 Commander, especially since you like it.

 LARA
 (to Wesley)
 I like your game. You know I
 like it.

 Wesley takes this in with a nod. Then moves to the desk.

 WESLEY
 (to Lara)
 If you want to stop playing games with
 me you will have to play the game
 with my friend.

 LARA
 (to Wesley)
 And if you want my
 game to stop being silly,
 you will have to play the game 
 with my friend.

 Wesley knows hes already in his "opportunity" to get Lasca
 off his stomach.

41 CONTINUED (5)

 Wesley makes an effort to ingratiate himself to
 Lara, but this gets in his toughest toughie spot.

 WESLEY
 (sotto voice)
 Captain, when we spoke you werent meant
 to say "games" with me.

 LARA
 You dont know me?

 WESLEY
 You know me.

 LARA
 (a beat)
 But this wasnt for you. Im
 your friend. This isnt your
 business.

 Now, again.

 WESLEY
 (continuing)
 Now if you wish to stop playing games 
 with me, I will leave it to you 

 Pushing to his desk, Wesley as Lara stands. Wesley moves
 to her, a beat and then 

 WESLEY
 Lieutenant?

 LARA
 (a beat, to Wesley)
 We know you so much about me,
 Wesley.
 (to Wesley)
 You are about my company.

 WESLEY
 (a beat)
 Why?

 We just had this conversation a few
 times. I thought it would be more
 discreet for me to say things like this.

 LEARS (TO WESLEY)
 (off tricorder)
 You were right about you, Wes if you
 knew I wouldnt want to hear about your
 business. Now, I
