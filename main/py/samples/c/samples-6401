?, please.

 OBRIEN
 That was nice? I hope you
 are not talking about anything
 pleasant here 

 He starts to try to calm him, but it only gets
 worse.

 SISKO
 Well, a compliment from an Ferengi 

 OBRIEN
 Yes, a nice thing that we can 
 count on.

 SISKO
 Good.

22 INTERIOR QUARK

 Quark sits patiently at his bar. Even though his temper is
 testable.

 QUARK
 The Klingons have done something to
 me. I have had to talk
 to my son, stop what
 Im doing. I could go to
 New Berlin, see what they have done
 to me. But nothing.

 FADE OUT.

28 INTERIOR INFIRMARY

 Bashir directs Sisko and Dax in his quarters.

 SISKO
 How long until we can talk
 to them?

 BASHIR
 Id like to start
 writing a script. I cant just
 take a crack at it. Besides,
 the fact that I couldnt
 write my story as the first
 draft.

 SISKO
 I dont think that will happen 
 tonight. That I will have
 to 

 Dax comes out of the back room wearing a Klingon
 PADD.

 DAX
 Its a portrait. The family they were
 killed, the wife, she was
 an adult. So how do you have
 any "crush" without being
 more than two hundred times as beautiful 
 as it was before? And look -
 hes the man in the wheelchair, whos
 in the middle of a war.

 SISKO
 Look 

 DAX
 For a Klingon 

 Sisko nods. Hes silent 

 SISKO
 Its funny 
 but we have never been
 Klingons.
 (a beat)
 Sisko must want to write some
 kind of revenge revenge

 WhatÂ 

 SISKO
 What do we have to talk about?

 DEEP SPACE "Progress" - REV. 2/26/93 - ACT THREE 32.

29 CONTINUED

 DAX
 About what am I supposed to talk
 about? What do you want 
 to talk about? Do you have
 any kind of "human" emotions?

 SISKO
 As much as I could, but I
 dont think there are any.

 DAX
 You have always been shortsighted
 its held in here.
 (a beat)
 Thats because it came right
 down. Most adults are only
 about twelve and thirty 
 years old. Are you even
 prepared for the first five
 years of adulthood?

 SISKO
 Only.

 DAX
 So instead of looking forward to
 your second, have you had enough
 drinks, Dr. Sol?

 SISKO
 One or both.

 DAX
 (surprised)
 You are talking about what?

 SISKO
 What 

 DAX
 We talk about you sometimes. What
 do you know about the Turei
 Quark?

 SISKO
 They are a very pleasant people

 DAX
 Yes but thats a little scary.

 SISKO
 Not at all.

 DAX
 Its not.

 SISKO
 When Jadzia comes in, settles down with 
 him and be happy for him 

 Dax gives a wan smile, then resumes working at the bar.

 SISKO
 So what do you tell me about the
 Quark? What do you know about him anyway?

 DAX
 He seems like a kid a long way from home.

 SISKO
 Keep the bar that you have
 always been a good man 

 DAX
 I guess thats the way I feel about
 you 

 SISKO
 I hope so.

 Sisko starts to get off the bar. She turns at
