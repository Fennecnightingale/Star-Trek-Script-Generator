ON THEIR PADD AND A PADD OF THEIR SHOT.

23 EXTERIOR HOLOGRIA - DAY (OPTICAL) -- - DAY

 Picard, Beverly, Data

 and their crewman turn back to the Starbase - a
 distant reflection - the same one Picard
 faced on the holodeck - is also staring in the
 mirror, as Picard and Riker turn
 toward him! Picard turns his head a little
 more toward Picard. "What?" Picard and RIKER are
 standing to Picard from the mirror - there
s a faint shadow
 behind Picard. Picard has a
 little smile, and RIKER
talks softly, eyes Picard out.

 Picard, RIKER

 DATA AND WORF in a few feet further. Picard and RIKER are
 both staring at Picard and RIKER - RIKER
eyes Picard and RIKER

 RIKER
(pours him a drink)
 Picard to Picard !

 Picard smiles, and is about to leave, when he turns
 back to Picard.

 RIKER
 Picard - they are getting to the
 door and Picard is being
 held back on the Holodeck -
 Picard out!

 Picard glances over RIKER and Picard

24 ANGLE PICARD - DINHO - HOMODEK - HOPT

 PICARD, RIKER AND PICARD

 are walking down the corridor - Picard and RIKER are
 in a tight spot. They are all having
 difficulty balancing the two of them.

 PICARD (V.O.)
 I will try to get out.

 RIKER
 Picard, Picard to Picard


 Picard is confused. Picard looks at RIKER and Picard is
 about to turn him in back and
 Picard turns at Picard - RIKER
Riker!

 Picard looks down at RIKER and Picard and Picard gets a
 slight sense that the thing
 has lost all momentum. Picard turns
 to Hiker

 CUT

33 ANGLE DINHOMODEK - HOPT ROOM - HOPT (OPTICAL)

 down at HIKER

 STAR TREK "Hymn" - 9/26/88 - ACT THREE 36.

33 CONTINUED

 PICARD (V.O.)
 Now we are in a corridor,
 Picard and HIKER
41 EXTERIOR HOLOGIA - DAY (OPTICAL)

 Picard has a feeling about
 the sound of a new friend

 PICARD
 (to Hiker)
 You know that, do you?

 HIKER
 Of course that I

 Picard leaves. Picard is not really
 HIKER.

 PICARD
 Picard out. Picard is HIKER,
 Picard is Picard, he cant change
 his mind about something
 without any reason
 to.

 HIKER
 (to Picard)
 Picard, Picard to Picard!

 Picard is amazed at HIKER.

 HIKER
 (to Picard)
 HIKER You said Picard.

 Picard continues his trek through the
 corridor and looks at HIKER - HIKER
I understand what you are
 putting him through.

 HIKER
 I just thought you
 said Picard.

 Picard looks at them.

 HIKER
 You have no choice.

 Picard continues.


 But we do have the right
 one - Picard is
 HIKER And Picard is HIKER. And the
 reason for Picard
 to stay out of
 communication

42 ANGLE PICARD - DINHO - HOPTICAL (OPTICAL)

 Picard, RIKER and HIKER leave Picard
 (to HIKER)
 HIKER You have the right
 one, Picard.

 Picard goes to Picard and speaks,

 PICARD
 Sir?

 HIKER
 Thats impossible.
 (to Picard)
 HIKER The truth.

 They all leave and Picard continues
 his trek into the darkness - Picard watches
 Picard enter a corridor - Picard turns
 off HIKER and heads toward Picard. Picard
 and Beverly enter the corridor, moving
 quickly and carefully. Picard
