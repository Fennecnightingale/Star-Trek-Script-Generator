 time of the year 

 Sisko smiles wanly at his father 

 SISKO 
 I thought I had a bad 
 impression of you and then 
 you see that?

 He watches them for a moment as they look at each 
 other and then EXIT 

 FADE OUT.

38 EXTERIOR SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

 As before. All images from the original 
 "The First Duty" script are 

 FADE TO

39 INTERIOR SISKO QUARTERS

 Picard is at the counter, working on 
 his computer, trying to think -

 "The First Duty" script from "Second Quality" 01/03/93 - ACT THREE 31.

39 ANGLE

 As before. The room now has the 
 same look we saw when we
 were moving back into the ship 

40 INTERIOR BRIDGE

 OBrien and Picard at the rear of the ship suddenly have a 
 major announcement -

 A CLOSE ON OBRIEN and OBrien. SCENE 32

 OBrien and their two officers, Mardassians and 
 the Ferengi ships officer are now running 
 parallel to their feet, trying to think 

41 ANGLE FROM BRIDGE

 Ody and Commander Dax are now moving away. It seems 
 for all the world that 
 its the Ferengi ship.



41 CONTINUED

 OBRIEN
 The Ferengi ship ?

42 CLOSE ON OBRIEN AND DEAF MARDASSIAN 

 As seen earlier, they can now see how the 
 ship was transporting into 

43 NEW ANGLE

 As before. The Ferengi ship suddenly vanishes its 
 sense of urgency as an impending 
 storm is going
 into the ship and the Cardassian 
 captain 

44 INTERIOR ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

 On the screen we see a STARFLEET OFFICER on the screen,
 RIKER and Dax.

 RIKER 
 Yes. I do. Its 
45 OPEN ANGLE

 The Ferengi ship has been alerted 
 to that very urgent message.
 We all know exactly what 
 is happening -
 because the Ferengi ship is 
 coming after us.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Second Quality" 01/03/93 - ACT THREE 32.

45 CONTINUED

 They immediately move to move back 
 behind 

 FERENGI CARRIA
 Dax is right. I will be 
 arriving at the Ferengi 
 tomorrow.

 OBRIEN 
 Dax, I think it would be wise to 
 do a pre-emptive firing strategy of 
 one. If I have to 
 evacuate your fleet right now its
 our best chance to defeat 
 this war.

 OBRIEN 
 We will keep it "stuck" until 
 you can get to your ship.

 OBRIEN
 (working on his computer)
 Just hang on.

 OBRIEN 
 It might be our only chance to 
 get all the things we need.

 OBRIEN 
 If you tell me not to 
 send you back to the ship, then 
 you can have the security 
 detail you put on 
 the Ferengi to cover?

 OBRIEN 
 I have a great idea. What if 
 it isnt for an empty 
 job that will get us all of 
 them, if you ask me 
 what?

 OBRIEN 
 It isnt that simple.
 You will find a lot of 
 men -

 OBRIEN 
 We will give them a few 
 more days to think 
 over what they are doing 
 before they send them back 

46 ANGLE ON OBRIEN AND DEAF 

 OBrien ENTERS from his command chair, 
 having just finished working on 
 his computer with the computer.

 OBRIEN
 I dont follow you.

 OBrien starts to walk toward the exit.
