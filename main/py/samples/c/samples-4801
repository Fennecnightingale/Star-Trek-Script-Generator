======== SAMPLE 1 ========


MAY We are all right.

RAN You told me you have
nothing to fear, and yet you seem

in denial.

SAR Captain - are we still doing the 
same?

GRG I wish I was. 

GRG Ransom, get our people out of the 

PKE (over combadge)- How dare you!
RAN - Are we still heading straight out of 
the Boraalans?

GRG Not yet.

RAN Tell the D-7 to prepare to beam down to the 
Rana IV colony.

SHIRA There is a terrible power blackout. 

RAN It will soon 

GRG We have never even considered that 
reconfiguring the transporter - are we not?

SHIRA A little. 
RAN You just cant stand
it up.

GRG Are you sure you cant?

SHIRA I dont know. 

GRG If you had a vision youd understand whats 
understanding.

SHIRA We didnt actually 
remember.

GRG Then I suppose I only have a few more days?

SHIRA We thought you and I could fly.

RAN Tell Rana we will be on Rana.

THOMPSON No. I cant, but if you are not aware of the restrictions, 
its impossible for you to take your way

RAN Im sorry.

GRG The experience was so overwhelming. 

SHIRA Im glad you dont mind.

RAN Now that you mention it Im willing to listen to you.

GRG Ransom, our people would not allow you

in their region. Rana, you are part of their population. 
You are part of D-7. Protect yourself. Don’t attack.

GRG So I suppose the Rana
is also a Ransom!

SHIRA My people wont attack.

GRG My people would.

SHIRA It’s not my problem.

GRG The problem is Rana. She attacked us in your 
own territory.

SHIRA Commander, we are going to withdraw.

GRG She did not attack the Rana.

SHIRA Your people would consider her a friend.

GRG She was Rana,

and she is human.

SHIRA We have come to learn that.

GRG We could use her help right now.

SHIRA Her help would be difficult. <|endoftext|>

CHAKOTAY You know what? Even if we talked to her, her 
wont work.

JANEWAY Tell Rana to tell Rana to stand down, please?

RAN The Klingons want us to go to the station, Captain. Rana?

GRG Rana is quite a lady, isnt she?

JANEWAY And as for her, I havent seen her again.

GRG What would be difficult?

JANEWAY But I would tell you that. Youd be surprised by the way 

GRG Listen to yourself. You have been listening to yourself for half a 
month, and those people still seem to be in denial.

GRG You would not be surprised even if she 

JANEWAY If she is only a day Rana, how would you characterize her?

GRG Much better. You seemed to say that about her a few days ago.

GRG You should stop, Chakotay.

GRG Im not. If I believed you, would you kill your own
daughter in front of her? You do this? I do not think so.

GRG Would I tell you how much Rana has suffered because I 
have claimed her mind?

JANEWAY Well, at least, you seem to have made the correct first course.

GRG You would have killed her yourself.

JANEWAY She was an intruder.

GRG To what?

JANEWAY To claim would be slander.

GRG Oh, really? There is a woman who has never 

JANEWAY And I mean, for that matter, how much Krieger 

GRG have you gotten by?

JANEWAY Tell me.

GRG How have we won to peace.

CHAKOTAY What about the girl?

GRG I have negotiated an apology.

GRG Her name is Oga
