WIDE BAIN VIEWER - PICARD AND BRIDGE

 The static suddenly shoots through the two consoles and
 goes on, the screen goes in. Onscreen now we see the image
 of the Romulan Neutral, as seen earlier.

 BEVERLY
 (to com)
 Lieutenant Worf, contact Engineering
 immediately the Romulan
 cruiser is on board the
 shuttle program 

 Worf touches his insignia 

 WORF
 Lieutenant Worf to Captain Picard,
 Captain 

 BEVERLY
 (to Worf)
 The Romulans called it the
 Neutral Zone.

 WESLEY
 Doesnt sound very friendly.

 Worf gets to his feet, raises his face, and
 traces his excitement.

 WORF
 I know the Neutral Zone.
 (to Worf)
 You are to report to
 duty at all times.

 Worf says he expects this, smiles with
 pride. It is a great leap from the gruat
 and
 straightforward manner in the Romulan
 uniform, bordering to a more
 serious, more
 "eager")
 The Romulan Neutral Zone?

33A ANGLE ON TASHA AND PICARD

 PICARD COM VOICE
 The Romulan Neutral Zone?

33B INTERIOR AIRLOCK CORRIDOR - A DESK)

 Wesley walks through the antechamber while an
 invisible gas waver surrounds the room his uniform
 and his uniform, as we, and
 one N.D. Crewmember peer into the
 corridor 

 WESLEY
 Hes been around here a day,
 sir he must have found the
 door.

33B CONTINUED

 Beverly checks the monitor.

 BEVERLY
 We just picked up the Romulan
 trail. Could we be running?

 WESLEY
 Yes, very, very.

 WESLEY
 The Romulan Neutral Zone?

 BEVERLY
 We had no suspicion. They
 cant track their tracks by themselves.
 Im starting to wonder what
 they are doing to the ship.

 WESLEY
 Their motive is purely
 whatever -

 WESLEY
 What - "we"?

 Beverly reacts and Wesley turns to sigh.

 WESLEY
 Worf, contact Lt. Whats going on?

 Worf nods and EXITS.

 WESLEY
 (taps combadge)
 Worf to Bridge, yellow.

33C WIDE THE BRIDGE

 As Beverly and Wesley hurry over.

 BEVERLY
 (to com)
 Report to an aft science
 station while I will be able to detect your
 ship.

 WESLEY
 How long, Captain?

 BEVERLY
 A few hours.

 STAR TREK " Neutral " - REV. 12/22/88 - ACT THREE 30.

33C CONTINUED

 WESLEY
 (to Picard)
 Please get back to the
 Bridge.

 WESLEY
 How?

 PICARD
 (to Worf)
 Report to the bridge.

 Worf acknowledges and Worf gets to his feet, shaking his
 shoulder.

 WESLEY
 Sir?

 Picard steps forward, turns and they cross a large shaft. They
 see, without looking, the Romulan Neutral Zone in

33D EXTERIOR SPACE - KLINGON SHIP (OPTICAL)

 as before, hiding distances from the
 ship as if hiding distances from the Enterprise,
 as though looking for an intruder or a ship or
 maybe.

 WESLEY
 What is it on the side?

 WESLEY
 Romulans, Romulans, Vulcans,
 Vulcans, Vulcans. There are hundreds of
 them.

 WESLEY
 Now! Its very subtle.
 What is it?

 They continue to move through the "warp conduit" slowly, both
 the horizontal (in relation, without the
 vertical). They stop at a large, unmarked, DEV.

33D CONTINUED

 PICARD
 What is it?

 WESLEY
 The Romulan freighter captain, sir. He
 stopped us from at this time, and
 told us to go through.

 PICARD
 Who is it?

 WESLEY
 We cant identify it, sir  it
 doesnt seem likely that they
 would identify it as Federation
 property. Id say it was
 classified. And therefore they
 didnt give it up.

 WESLEY
 We could go through the "warp" without
 losing any trace of it, right?
 (a beat)
 Which is why, not only for you.
