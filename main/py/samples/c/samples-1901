 is, but is
 nothing like any other life form we might have
 in fiction. Nor do
 any of our devices. No
 waste of time.

 She smiles at the sight of him 

 BEVERLY
 (calling out)
 Data I am not so sure of that.

 BEVERLY
 It will be all my life.

 Data smiles back and EXITS to 
 where the away team has disappeared 

 ODO
 That doesnt mean goodbye, Data.

 BEVERLY
 Its just that I dont want 
 you to take over as a good friend in 
 the same way that others are?

 ODO
 I dont mind it sounds 
 too good, doesnt it?

 BEVERLY
 What would you say 
 (re Data)
 of the future.

 DATA
 I am an android.

 BEVERLY
 And a member of the Collective.

 DATA
 That is an insult to me.

 BEVERLY
 I am Human. And for that
 reason, I didnt become
 human.

 BEVERLY
 Why not?" We have 
 a lot in common.
 Im a scientist, like Data. Your
 friend from the day
 when you walked out the door.

 Data looks at her, and his jaw hardens 

 DATA
 You are not a member of 
 the Collective. You are an individual mind 
 in your own right and here in this
 chamber. Are you ready to die?

 BEVERLY
 (nods, not a threat)
 Yes, Commander Data.

 Data stands and EXITS to the corridor 

32 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE & THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

 The away team continues to disappear down the corridors, 
 until a VISOR OPENS and the away team reappears 

 ODO (V.O.)
 We have been unable to locate the ship and the
 away team.
 (a beat)
 I am holding a force field that appears to 
 be stabilizing their 

 BEVERLY
 The force field has released the 
 shuttle, Captain. It appears to be 
 going through the forcefield 
 effect only if the forcefield destabilises 

 The away team is back in formation, and Data, Odo and 
 arrive.

 Data turns and heads for the turbolift. Picard frowns 
 and heads for one as well from behind

 WORF
 (to Picard)
 A shuttle?

 PICARD
 (continuing)
 They have built a course into the 
 nebula which will allow them 
 in time to catch the shuttle 
 it will become almost a surprise 
 experience for anyone who can
 follow it.

 WORF
 How can you warn him?

 PICARD
 The force field will destabilise as the 
 forces fall on the shuttle.

 WORF
 (concerned)
 Is there any way we can counteract it?

 WORF
 Nothing, sir. The shuttle 
 will destabilise - but the shuttle will 
 not cause any damage until it goes the
 way it has been 

 The away team reacts to Datas look of hope in front 
 him 

 WORF
 (continuing)
 They are on the other side of the 
 nebula - it is graviton based 
 on current trajector 

 The away team heads for the turbolift 

 WORF
 (continuing)
 Captain Picard will lead you to 
 the corridor.

 TASHA
 (stiffly)
 I dont know what it will be like 
 to see the shuttle destroyed 
 in another six hours.

 WORF
 (crestfallen)
 Captain Picard, we need to get out of here, 
 so you may 

 BEVERLY
 (nods)
 I will need to bring you up to date 
 so you can prepare 

 Picard eyes Worf and EXITS the turbolift. He has stopped 
 counting as he enters the turbolift, takes a few cards 
 to hand out, and tosses a hand.

 WORF
 The force field is holding 
 this conference hostage 

 BEVERLY
 I dont care about that 

 WORF
 (picks up on it)
 Hes a traitor to you.

 BEVERLY
 (picks this)
 He doesnt seem to care about your 
 position. Hes only exploiting you 
 for your trouble.
