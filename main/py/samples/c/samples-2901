 logical. On their sight, the girl says nothing to him that was said to her, just a few stray glances across her
reaction. So they all walk aside from her, all right, all right. She says she has just
heard about the incident at PJem.

 CHAKOTAY
 I just went into business.

32 ON TROI

 Who watches the situation intently. Shes being watched by
 people who expect her to look up and have just forgotten
 everything that happened 

 A beat, then

 TROI
 I think you just might want to
 talk to me about what just just happened.

 A long pause. Picard glances back, and she smiles.

32A ON NEELIX

 Who knows more about this.

 NEELIX
 Im getting worried.

 PICARD
 What do you mean?

 NEELIX
 I just dropped an interesting news.
 The ships being repaired
 is a good sign.

 Picard nods.

 PICARD
 Then I will accept that we have put a
 new bridge at their current
 length for six months.

 NEELIX
 I will keep working on it. If they fit
 well

 The ships in a better position.

 PICARD
 Nice work.

32A CONTINUED

 DATA
 There are seven lifeforms aboard
 my ship.

 PICARD
 (a smile)
 That means we are facing
 a much more fearsome enemy
 with much greater firepower.

 DATA
 We are not the enemy we
 should be worried about.
 (a beat to Riker)
 Do you believe the
 situation demands my
 attention?

 PICARD
 Yes. And you are right we are
 looking at a potential enemy who
 may well intend to use us to
 defeat it 

 A beat As Neelix ponders this 

 GEORDI
 The Romulans should be
 wary of us. We have just seen
 something that will help them
 come back.

 DATA
 Do you believe this is the
 prelude for an attack against
 your fortress?

 RIKER
 (without thinking)
 No.

 DATA
 I do not believe it is your
 initial ship Commander.

 GEORDI
 Then who are you to make the
 case 

 DATA
 There are seven Federation ships
 on the away team 

 PICARD
 They are all ready to fight the
 Romulans.

 Data acknowledges the seriousness of the situation.

 as he works his panels. Then as he
 sits next to Riker, Data takes an oath, "I am
 the captain of this vessel in true Klingon
 warrior language." RIKER
 (to Picard)
 In that case,
 I will accept the captain
 under one conditions,
 in your own words, if you
 will fight me.

 Jellico gets up, moves quickly down Riker
 as he sits next to Riker.

 Jellico nods he accepts. Then he moves off to check his
 work.

 (to Data)
 We will see that the ships engines are
 almost ready to fire a
 sustained cycle of one
 hundred seven point one
 cycles.

 DATA
 There are several ships
 orbiting the system with
 their sensors.

 TROI
 There will be ship
 detection sensors throughout the
 system for
 days and even
 weeks?

 DATA
 I would expect their
 reactions to our ship
 appearance to the contrary
