======== SAMPLE 1 ========



 SISKO
 (angry)
 You really wouldnt do anything to provoke a
 conflict.

 BAREIL
 The Ferengi business is to order.
 They will never agree to this.

 And with that, they both leave, leaving him more than
 ready to confrontation WV-SIX

60 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

 still in orbit above Minos, where it can only
 be picked up and transmitted.

61 INTERIOR ENTERPRISE - TEMPLE

 Picard is smiling at Beverly as Riker moves in without
 even realizing that shes doing this, but he gets
 serious and makes no move to give her the hint.

 PICARD
 Its all right. The Enterprise will stay
 at full alert until its
 been too long. And then, I will make
 absolutely sure that whoever ends this
 pointless, violent act
 will never leave it undone.

 Beverly nods and EXITS into the turbolift. Riker
 looks up at Picard, and it is clear that this young
 Picard has taken all this.

62 OMITTED

63 INTERIOR ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM (OPTICAL)

 Picard has asked Worf what to have
 for discussion among the Ferengi. They are
 sitting at a table, talking. He crosses to Beverly
 and hands her a PADD.

63 CONTINUED

 BEVERLY
 The power output has
 doubled-

 WORF
 The Ferengi are very good at
 interfacing computers,
 and thats why they are
 this fast.

 PICARD
 (dubious)
 Its certainly not the fault of
 Captain Picard. You were right about
 it.
 (beat)
 Its just that I have got the feeling
 I have to get the
 Enterprise out 
 (beat)
 Personally, I like that as much as
 you do.
 (beat)
 But I cant leave her in there
 for me.

 STAR TREK "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/30/90 - ACT THREE 33.

64 REVEAL AGE

 PICARD
 There is only one problem. Your
 fleet is too great a
 starship to move off the
 bridge of the Ferengi.

65 CLOSE ON WORF AND BEVERLY

 BEVERLY
 Yes?

 DATA
 You were right about that.
 The Enterprise is a fleet
 vessel - they are only to be
 deployed once. So
 Commander Riker ordered us
 to advise him that the
 ship was towing a
 distress ship.

 BEVERLY
 That was the request?

 DATA
 It was, sir.

 BEVERLY
 (thinks, sighs)
 He must be sick.

 DATA
 Perhaps it would be simpler
 than this "resettlement" which
 he built himself,
 Captain Picard might actually want those
 people to live in the
 settlement.

 DATA
 We will never know what Commander
 Picard ordered us to do,
 sir.

 PICARD
 (nods)
 If they are indeed in
 danger, we cannot
 allow them to go to
 Cardassia Prime.

 DATA
 I find that the
 settlement is well-armed,
 Captain. It is a large,
 complex complex ship which is
 capable of receiving their
 thoughts of the Enterprise.

 BEVERLY
 Captain, you cant just
 refuse them. It is our
 obligation to them that we have
 to help them overcome their
 fears of leaving Cardassia.

 STAR TREK "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/30/90 - ACT THREE 34.

66 BACK TO SCENE AND SCENE

 DATA
 It takes us a little longer to
 accept the fact that they are
 in danger.

 A long beat as they absorb the
 enormity of what Picard is saying, then, they
 turn to SEE SPEED ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)

 DATA
 It is a form of communication.

 BEVERLY
 A form of speech?

 DATA
 The Ferengi believe
 in infrequent use of small
 moments to make meaningful
 promises, but in a
 complicated verbal setting, their
 minds are much better at manipulating
 simple language and simple
 facts. They rarely express
 personal views of the
 complex workings of their
 interstellar environment.

 BEVERLY
 There are some ways of
 communication around here.

 DATA
 Which is one of them that
 you may have.

 This is the most difficult meeting for both of
 them. They are interrupted by a
 look-up at each other, a shake of the
 sky.
