 OBRIEN
 I think we have reached all we 
 need is to get on the table.

 BASHIR
 That may be so.

 Bashir gets up and moves about the room, trying to find 
 any clue to the location of the torpedo.
 A frustrated sound begins to become a response 
 off screen.


 OBRIEN
 I cant tell you exactly how to 
 do this.
 (impering)
 Anybody can use a little help.

 BASHIR
 Commander, we have very little time. 
 We want the wormhole to open 
 to their starboard catwalk.

 OBRIEN
 (shaking his head)
 How long will it take them to 
 cross the barrier?

 BASHIR
 The Defiants going to open the 
 catwalk. At least we will be 
 free of the constant worry about them 
 while we can.

 OBRIEN
 They will have to come through the 
 barrier by the time 
 they are done.

 BASHIR
 And what about Major Kira?

 OBRIEN 
 Kira is still tending to her alacrity. 
 At the moment, she was in place of a 
 life. I think she could have 
 been here for a week.

 BASHIR
 Then you see. Major Kira, she 
 wasnt going to die by this time. 
 She was going to die by the time 
 she was through with you.

47 INTERIOR CHAMBER - NIGHT #2 - NIGHT #3 

 A figure moves into shots and sets to work. The door 
 CHIMES.

48 INTERIOR CHAMBER - NIGHT #4

 An exhausted Bashir and OBrien watch the two figures 
 take up positions outside in front of the room. They look 
 pretty threatening - they are in the dark and shadows.

 BASHIR
 (to OBrien)
 Come on come on 

 OBRIEN
 (taking cover)
 Benjamin, we havent taken down the 
 station yet.

 BASHIR
 (re OBrien)
 We are still running to tests.

 OBRIEN
 We did a full test last 
 night. They nearly overloaded the 
 computers. They didnt want us 
 to give it the experiment any more 
 chance.

 An audible pause.

 BASHIR
 How many?

 OBRIEN
 Fifty-eight. They didnt finish the 
 experiment.


 Kira approaches the table with excitement.

 KIRA
 (into communicator) 
 Bashir to Doctor Bashir. There was 
 something interesting to say.

 BASHIR
 Im relieved to hear it.

 OBRIEN
 Lets go.

 BASHIR
 Im sorry. Please 

50 INTERIOR INFIRMARY - ON MONITOR (OPTICAL) 

 On a monitor, an Okudagram is 
 graphic of the human brain that we saw in the 
 Tezra.

51 NEW ANGLE

 On Kira as she stands at the monitor. The 
 Okudagram we saw in action is back on its 
 monitor. Worf is standing nearby.

 BASHIR
 The Cardassian genetic pattern strikes me 
 as one of the main influences 
 against the Cardassians 
 genetic patterns of choice as Kira 
 approaches the room?


 KIRA
 As Head of medicine, I am trying my best to 
 build up a balanced condition.

52 NEW ANGLE

 As Kira sits down to study the chart of the Cardassian genetic codes 
 on the monitor.
