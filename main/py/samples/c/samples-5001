 BASHIR
 Im a doctor. I can do anything to
 improve your condition.

 ZEPHTTELL
 (reluctant) 
 Are you sure its not a disease?

 BASHIR
 This has nothing to do with an infection. 
 Its a genetic resequencing. 
 It could be beneficial.

 ZEPHTTELL
 How do you know that?

 BASHIR
 Because I was the only one to 
 tell the Doctor that you 
 had two weeks worth of fighting 
 the Breen. I had to win his confidence. 
 That means I have to convince 
 the doctor that I wont let 
 him die. Otherwise, I have 
 no choice but to put you with 
 a life in the Residence Locarno.

 ZEPHTTELL 
 You know as much about the 
 Residence Locarno as I do.
 (beat) 
 I have a few tricks that 
 might explain why this 
 isnt working.

 BASHIR 
 Youd better inform the 
 captain.

 ZEPHTTELL
 (dry) 
 No.

 BASHIR
 Then donâ€™t mention it.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Search of Angels"-SEVRIN - REV. 7/13/98 - ACT THREE 35.

 ZEPHTTELL 
 You want to tell me, Julian? How 
 do you know that?

 Bashir nods-a and ZepHTTELL begins to walk briskly toward the helm 
 console while Bashir waits behind them, his back to 
 the turbolift, and then ZepHTTELL 
 ENTERS that the doors to the turbolift are 
 locked and the doors do not open, so as not even 
 to be able to enter.

 ZEPHTTELL 
 We will do a double handed caress.

 ZEPHTTELL 
 That will cost two thousand 
 strips of gold-pressed latabic 
 ore and a pair of 
 silvery coins.

 BASHIR 
 You are suggesting we haul the entire ore 
 from the subterranean 
 caves to the hoquefort?

31 INTERIOR ANOTHER ANGLE

 ZEPHTTELL
 It is an extremely risky operation, 
 Captain. It carries the risk of 
 collaying an infection to the entire 
 entire crew.

 BASHIR
 Personally, Doctor, I think this is 
 too risky.

 ZEPHTTELL 
 But Commander Siskos doing all he can to find you 
 something that will prove you wrong.

 BASHIR 
 You are suggesting that we 
 set up a medical supply for 
 the entire world?

 ZEPHTTELL 
 It is not that he is asking for 
 anything. If he had wanted to live 
 alone, hed have settled here in 
 a Terran village instead of carrying 
 out this rescue.

 But Bashir seems to have knocked the nail.

 BASHIR
 You are suggesting that I should start 
 collecting the ore myself?

 ZEPHTTELL 
 Of course.
 (with finality) 
 Every centimeter of this world is fed into 
 the central bank of each planet, to 
 the very center of the entire world.

 In the middle of the world is the core.

 ZEPHTTELL 
 Then, does nothing.

 Bashir is reminded of the words.

 BASHIR 
 At first, I thought it was a fantasy.

 ZEPHTTELL 
 Then, I realized I was almost to 
 the point where we had to start 
 communicating with one another.
 (beat) 
 And I felt pretty damn stupid. But 
 now I know that 

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Search of Angels" - SEVRIN - 7/13/98 - ACT THREE 36.

31 CONTINUED

 ZEPHTTELL 
 (with irony)
 But how much I hate being so 
 helpless.

 Bashirs hurt - the pain will sting but Hold on -

 BASHIR /ZEPHTTELL 
 I know. But I have 
 had it. I knew hed wake up if 
 anything 
 (beat)
 could help me. And when I came, 
 my plan was to get a party 
 out of here. Thats what this is. And to 
 the point, I had to lie. So if 
 I told my doctor I had three days of 
 waiting, he would listen to 
 me. But no one. Not everyone. 
 Not me
