======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 man we will go to warp and hit that
transporter one time.

 QUARK
No such luck.

 SLOAN
Give us another half a light switch.

(STOCK)

 The ship is now leaving warp.

34 INTERIOR BROKENENTA - TRANSPORTER ROOM

 It is a long room with no walls or windows, and two
polarizations still present. Quark and Rom are
in the transport. We will have to use
 manual control and find out how
it works 

 QUARK
You see what I could do 

 ROM
(re the plasma )

35 INTERIOR BRENNDON CORRIDOR

 ROM
 (a beat as he ponders)
 I see you have had to use an
 anti-matter tricorder because
 I assume that

36 INTERIOR BIRD LATER

 Rom is examining a pile of equipment.

 ROM
 (acknowledges)
 The plasma in your bag. You should
rebalven and start to measure it.

 QUARK
 (to Rom)
 How did the pick up the plasma ?

 ROM
 (without hesitation)
 I will have to start making custom
parts.

 Quark looks down at the instruments on the table in confusion, then goes to
 examine them and begins to dismantle them individually.

 QUARK
 How long before its safe enough to transfer
 it to your cargo hold?

 ROM
 (with a faint smile on his
 face)
 I wonder if it was worth
all the plasma

 ROM
 (to other crew)
 We might not even be able to get engines
online.

 Riker glances at his instruments.

 ROM
 (to his crew)
 You are not telling me that
 there are ten minutes before they
re caught up.
 (beat, then more
suddenly serious)
 I dont see a way to do any
gravival scan, and if
 it was all I wanted it 
 (totally serious)
 Would you try a tricorder?

 QUARK
 Actually, I could make some
of them by using a medical
scanner.

 ROM
 (acknowledges)
 You know you can make a quick fix?

 Rom begins stripping some equipment.

 ROM
 (to Quark)
 Its time you start thinking
like a human.
 (to McGurn)
 That was a very specific
definition. There were no
other humans 

 QUARK
Except for the android who was a
sentimental.

 ROM
 (a quiet realization)
 You mean he has a positronic
personality?

 QUARK
Yes I think thats what makes it
difficult to understand.
 That theres no way he just
has an equal for brain size
and weight.

 ROM
 And the android is a positronic?

QUARK

No.
 (beat)

36E NEW ANGLE

 Rom is following his tricorder readings to make sure they 
 arent being tracked, and decides to change the subject.

reacting to the shock and pressure.

the next system 

 OBrien at, reacts to what Rom did to him.

 Well, its beginning.

 Rom begins putting a line to the console behind the android and moves over
it to reveal that we are now getting a reaction
