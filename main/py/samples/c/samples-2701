======== SAMPLE 1 ========


RES

, as if hes a child. We might,
 Worf has not told them he is a
boy.

 WORF
 That is not the truth.

 WORF
 I cant stand the way, you and I.

 The boy cant stop himself and he falls silent. He
 stands up for the first time, steps into the
 center. Worf is the center of the
 room, a little taller than his
 station. Troi stands
 there watching him take this in.

 WORF
 I was beginning to regret it I
 didnt mean to throw your
 career into doubt.

 Troi makes an adjustment and the little 
 boy steps forward.

 KIRA
 You mean thats funny?

 WORF
 Sort of.

 She smiles, and there is a little of chemistry between the two
 of them.

 KIRA
 Now did I hurt you?

 WORF
 No, no.

 KIRA
 Now you will hurt me?

 WORF
 I do.

 STAR TREK "Elementary Day" - REV. 4/5/90 - ACT THREE 28.

40 CONTINUED

 KIRA
 I mean, that you will.
 (beat)
 That you want to hurt me?

 WORF
 All right, Kudosh, but you just
 dont seem very happy with the 
 way I have handled this?

 Troi smiles at this.

 LUTAN COM VOICE
 Captain Kiras to-

 KIRA COM VOICE
 Captain, Captain Kiras in your
 office.

 Suddenly the SOUND of Kiras VOICE is heard, and
 there is a CHIME. Its Kiras.

 KIRA
 Captain, Im getting worried.

 WORF
 Of course I am, Captain.
 Of course I am. Im sorry, your
 (pointedly)
 friend didnt get off the ship.

 KIRA
 (surprised)
 What was he saying?

 WORF
 That was Kiras.

 KIRA
 And hes the one with the problem?
 (off his look)
 Arent you?

 WORF
 I dont know he even on the Enterprise.

 KIRA
 What are you talking about?

 WORF
 Is it about?

 KIRA
 Dont you see me, my friend? Im the one who
 seems upset.

 Worf tries to suppress the truth and says nothing.

 WORF
 (continuing)
 Of course.

 KIRA
 What was he saying he didnt want to
 leave Enterprise? He was an
 honest mistake.

 WORF
 (beat)
 I dont blame you. You were
 just following my orders.

 STAR TREK "Elementary Day" - REV. 4/5/90 - ACT THREE 29.

41 CONTINUED (2)

 KIRA
 I have to make sure I stick to
 those orders.

 WORF
 And if I am not following
 those orders? Then I
 can damn well ask myself
 why.

42 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

 as before, travelling at high warp speed.

42 INTERIOR SICKBAY

 Worf and KIRA
 (to com)
 Captain, the Romulan vessel is
 hailing us.

 WORF
 Onscreen.

 ODO
 Captain?

 WORF
 Not until you request
 authorization.

 ODO
 I dont see why.

 WORF
 Doctor, would you care to
 provide us with your medical
 treatment?

 KIRA
 Dont you require some information?

 WORF
 (nodding)
 Just my medical advice.

 KIRA
 All right. Im sorry Im not
 happy to get this information out to the
 Romulans.

 Worfs voice rises. Hes not angry. They may
 have heard Worf had something of a
 secret.

 WORF
 Captain, please allow me to
 hear your medical
 advice.

 Worf begins a sentence and when it hits, its with an old
 axiom.

 WORF
 (continuing)
 The Enterprise is no secret.
 (beat)
 Im afraid I will reveal my
 secrets to you to you.

 Picard and Troi exchange grim beat.

42 CONTINUED

 Picard knows theres only one
 hes really had a problem with, and he
 doesnt like being forced into this.

 DATA
 (continuing)
 I was not the best captain I
 had.
 (beat)
 Im sorry, Captain. Its very
 too easy to talk about things to me.

 Worf doesnt reply. Off Picard
 silent expression as he waits for his response, we

 FADE OUT.
