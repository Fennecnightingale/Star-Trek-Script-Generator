======== SAMPLE 1 ========
ix I know it doesnt seem easy
for you but, I have learned my lessons. Well, I will leave you
to your work.

 As he walks through the crowd, the LIGHTS flickering
 for a few beats and then the room is filled by a
 handful of new faces around him - the man who called
him "sir," they are all standing around.

 As he walks through the room 

 KIRA
 (echoing) 
 The LIGHTS its working.

 At first the LIGHTS are only the HIGHTS of a
 VISIBLE KIRK DIM AND SIR. With his new
 persona they push past the
 people around them and he has no
to do anything for himself.

 KIRA
 Thats a big step.

 KIRA
 And to believe it has grown
a couple of ways, hes
trusted by society now 
 Everyone seems to be very interested in him 
 and hes like a new world
 for a new world 

 KIRA
 (shrugs) 
 Maybe some of this is happening and 
 I havent much more of it.


 It feels like its only the beginning.

 KIRA
 Theres something I wish to say to
commend. Itd help if I were you.

 He speaks into his microphone.

 KIRA
 First they called me a liar.

 I
brought the truth down to my
people and told them that was a 
 lie. They said they didnt 
 believe me, and even threatened to 
 die if Int?

 And KIRA
 (shrugs) 
 Well it happened. And it 
 didnt look like that bad.

 KIRA
 (shrugs) 
 Well it does have started 
 for a change.

 KIRA
 (shrugs, takes the 
 micromanagement off) 
 So, you, I can tell you the 
 truth about my people. Whats happened to them, 
 and I want you to know 
nothings happening to anybody.

 But Kira isnt as ready to admit that shes wrong.

 KIRA
 Nothings happening, Im not 
 scared, Im just excited.

 KIRA
 And you have reminded us all 
 that you dont believe 
 me.

 KIRA
 (laughs) 
 Well, Im beginning to.

 Kira cant believe shes suddenly reminded to the others of 
 her but when Kira gets to the truth, its clear the stress 
 that shes been under.

 KIRA
 (shrugs) 
 I realize that and so do two of 
 you, now.

 KIRA
 Dont worry, if I have time for 
 to argue, everyone out there 
 will say that.

 KIRA
 (shaking head) 
 We are all friends, arent 
 we?

 Kira EXITS.

 A long, thin man, JIMMERMAN, walks in to her house. 
 He is obviously disreputable - a person very 
 who is attractive and high-class with a manner that
 somehow appears a bit seductive. He is wearing a small green 
 baiz in her mind, perhaps a bit bigger.

 JAKE (O.S.) 
 How, what do you know?

21 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

 A second later, we are not looking at the table.

 JAKE (O.S.) 
 Why are you so reluctant to 
 dance?

 DAX
 Dont mind, it suits you.

 JAKE (O.S.) 
 What do you mean?

 DAX
 (indicating the music) 
 I know theres music on 
 a Klingon holodeck program 
 called The MaQUis.

 JAKE (O.S.) 
 Why dont you try it?

 DAX
 (shrugs) 
 My replicator or a Ferengi?

 JAKE (O.S.) 
 But I have never in either case I 
 remember it.

 DAX 
 Thats just the beginning
