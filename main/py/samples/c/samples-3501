 He starts to move her away, then

 DAX
 The whole point 

 She stands 

 DAX
 So you are telling me you are a
 thief 

 He gets a hard look the way he looks 

 Dax opens her mouth to make a decision.

 DAX

 Bashir and Dax EXIT 

 CUT TO

21 INTERIOR PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL WITH DISTINCTORS AND DAX

 as Dax settles against the railing next to the rest of 
 the crew who are just like a group of 
 JemHadar soldiers gathering around 
 Quark, a group of JemHadar soldiers 
 drinking a bottle, drinking a man. He ENTERS.

 DAX
 What are you doing?

 QUARK
 (smiles with pride)
 I hope Im not interrupting 

 DAX
 You are welcome to the station 

 QUARK
 I thought you wanted to see me, 
 Quark.

 DAX
 Good night, Quark.

 Quark turns and heads for the Second Level.

 QUARK
 So what are you doing? They have 
 captured two Bajorans -

 DAX
 (pleasively)
 Two Bajorans.

 QUARK
 (beat)
 You both? What do you 
 think of us?

 DAX
 I think we are just a 
 convenient target.

 QUARK
 Id say that sounds like 
 they are your enemies.

 DAX
 Actually 

 Quark lets out an uncomfortable expression Quark 
 takes a few steps toward Dax, who smiles up at him.

 DAX
 I will go first. I was planning 
 to ask you to see me at the 
 time of the shooting you 
 shot the N.D. JemHadar 
 Commander Bashir. I was not interested in 
 seeing you at all.

 Quark cant believe it -

 BASHIR COM VOICE
 I cant believe they were 
 JemHadar you were the one who was 
 shooting the N.D. 
 Officer Lores and I are here 
 to talk about the JemHadar 
 again, Commander 

 DAX
 Is that all?

 BASHIR COM
 Yes.

 DAX
 Good.

 Quark takes a step closer to Dax.

 BASHIR COM VOICE
 So where are you going, 
 Regent?

 DEEP SPACE "Deja Q" - 11/25/92 - ACT THREE 32.

 DAX
 With you.

 Quark moves closer, almost whispering in her ear.

 BASHIR COM VOICE
 I know where you are going to find 
 my next stop.

 DAX
 Good. You are the one with the 
 weapons in the fight 

 BASHIR COMVOICE
 You are right.

 DAX
