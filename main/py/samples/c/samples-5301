 wish it.

 Bashir looks at the tool in his hand.

 BASHIR
 Its not that bad.

 Dax holds up the tissue. In the b.g., the Borg is looking right
 up at her in pain.

 BASHIR
 Oh my Gegi!

 DAX
 I have been given broad leaping
 (a humming growls)
 to the great Kahless.

 There is a moment of pain as the Borg looks into
 its own sickbay. Dax grabs out of bed with pain as
 though the Borg has a tight grip.

 DAX
 Im sorry Im crying but you
 have got to shut me out - and theres no
 choice.

48 CONTINUED (2)

 DAX
 No. I wont shut you 
 out !

 Dax feels some anger.

 DAX
 You dont understand - the
 man I once was is sick!

 DAX
 Yes.

 DAX
 You dont understand - how I
 was told my family was destroyed. My
 family is gone. Im not sure I can
 make out that part of my life out.

 DAX
 How? By cutting off your
 family?

 DAX
 Yes. But I do see that I might have had
 an influence on your
 settlement?

 DAX
 You just turned out to be one
 of them. You helped create
 your Collective.

 DAX
 Thats a lie. My real family doesn
 never see me as a friend. I was a
 projection.

 Dax leans back into the bed.

 DAX
 Dont lie to me about your
 family.

 DAX
 I never said I wanted our
 community. I just wish I
 had one.

 DAX
 What about your husband? My real
 family. I look at him

48 CONTINUED (5)

 DAX
 When he broke you, he told me that
 you were dead. He told me that you
 were his family. He even asked me to a
 funeral before he had to choose 

 DAX
 I don’t think he would have said that. They
 never met. I never saw him as he
 did. I certainly tried. Sometimes
 a little bit of pain. Thats all I could do
 for a moment.
 (a beat)
 He told me that he cared about you. He
 even told me he cared about you.
 You are a man who missed his
 family. He cared about you.

 Dax stands - begins to look at her.

 DAX (contd)
 I can’t have my life without you.

 DAX
 It is better for you to leave.

 DAX
 What?

 DAX
 There is nothing to return.

56 CONTINUED

 DAX
 I need to reconnect with my family.

 DAX
 Why? What is it?

 DAX
 Do you think your life would
 be better if it were not
 tied to your family?

 DAX
 I don’t think it would be any
 better.

 DAX
 What if you lived like your father?

57 NEW ANGLE

 As Sisko and Dax exit.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "What You " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE 35.

58 CONTINUED

 DAX
 I told you that my brother is quite
 a man, and he cares about
 a small matter.

 DAX
 You are right. I do this
 as I know it.

 DAX
 What kind of question is
 that?

59 CLOSE ON DAX AND DAX

 As she returns to the bed.

 DAX
 You dont know your personal
 history?

 DAX
 I wish I.

 DAX
 How? By your account, you
 have not had a birth until
 the age of inclusion -

 DAX
 You mean "birth."

 DAX
 Not exactly, but I do know where
 we can trace our
 origins. And there is something
 I can learn from my mother and is
 that not only does not make me part of our
 family - she knows she’s a granddaughter.
