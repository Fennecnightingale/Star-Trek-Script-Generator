39 ANGLE - SISKO

 staring out his window - unable to focus
 when the lights come back.

 SISKO
 (annoyed)
 They keep coming at you at
 intervals of time.
 (moves away)
 I have never been you before.

39 CONTINUED

 NOG
 (re tricorder)
 Its not hard to pick a
 random man.

 SISKO
 Why not?

 NOG
 I think its a safe bet.

 Sisko stands - stops him, shakes his
 head, shakes his head.

 NOG
 I think its safe bet.

 And with that the JemHadar moves off
 toward the JemHadar.

40 INTERIOR OPS

 Kira, Dax, N.D. and SUPERNITED TACTICAL
 N.D. JemHadar Officers as needed.

 DAX
 What was I supposed to do?

 NEPHADAR OFFICER
 You were supposed to monitor
 transmissions that were critical.
 I should have listened to them.

 DAX
 (re panel)
 You dont believe this?

 NEPHADAR OFFICER
 That is not important at this point.

 DAX
 Its important. If you dont
 monitor them in the normal
 manner you will be forced
 to take them offline.
 (beat)
 But you will have to do
 something with them first.
 (beat)
 Please sit back.

 NEPHAD OFFICER
 You wont be able to keep them
 online right away.

41 INTERIOR OPS

 Kira and the JemHadar move in close.

 KIRA
 You are right, Im not.

 The JemHadar Officers move in close.

 KIRA
 Im not letting them threaten their
 future.

 The JemHadar officers turn and stare at the wall.

 KIRA
 This is my fault.

 The JemHadar Officers move back and look at it.

 KIRA
 I dont like it either of you.

 The JemHadar Officers take back their bows.

 KIRA
 You wouldnt take it personally.

 The JemHadar walks off as the JemHadar turns his
 back with his batleth.

 KIRA
 Im sorry for what happened. 
 But you and your people have to accept
 the consequences. You are responsible
 for this predicament. You are responsible. 
 We both are. And right now the only
 choice is to make you pay for what
 you did.

 KIRA

 I dont want to give you a choice.

 beside his predecessor.

 Officers.

 KIRA

 I dont think you give me an easy
 moment.

44 NEW ANGLE

 As the JemHadar Soldiers turn to confront their predecessors, who have 
 turned to their task, and are looking at them warily.
 They are looking at the JemHadar with incredulity, a 
 mix of awe and derision.

44A RESUME

 The JemHadar Soldiers take the bows into position.

 KIRA
 Thats one way to deal with them,
 isnt there?

 The JemHadar Soldier nods to the JemHadar.

 KEIKER
 Thats what you want?
 You want us to give you more 
 than enough.

 KIRA
 You dont want more 

 The JemHadar Soldier turns to his original task.
 The JemHadar continues to stare at the wall.

 As the JemHadar turns to his original task. The JemHadar soldier
 turns to the JemHadar and gives him a severe
 look.
