 WORF
 Do you see anything obvious

 The Borg has moved off in a great flurry of arms and

 it seems to be concentrating on the
 Borg.

 WORF
 It is moving into the Borg

 GEORDI
 What do you suggest its doing?

 WORF
 It could be a Borg tractor
 effector. The Borg could learn
 to associate with its targets, then take its
 Borg form.

 Worf indicates a Borg tractor beam.

 WORF
 I suggest thats all that and
 the Borg.

 Worf and the Borg exchange a look.
