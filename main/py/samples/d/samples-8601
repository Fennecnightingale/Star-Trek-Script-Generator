 for the
 JemHadar. This ship might explode. Im doing
what I can to make it work.

 BASHIR
 We will have to restart the
 engines. Our only hope comes to me.
 I will be the captain.

 OBRIEN
 Theres nothing you can do.
 What about us. I know theres
 nothing you can do.

 BASHIR
 You are talking about precision flying.
 Im fine. But Im in need of your
 help. Dont be discouraged. We can get
 home.

 OBRIEN
 Dont be. We have home,
 Julian.

 But more than that.

 BASHIR
 I dont think so either.
 In fact, I dont think I will ever
 be able to help you.

 Theres a beat, then 

 DAX COM VOICE
 Dax to Bashir.

 Bashir and Dax exchange a look we have never seen
 such clarity in their eyes 

 DAX COM VOICE
 Can you come a transport from the
 
 station to us?

 BASHIR
 (to com)
 I can bring you aboard 

 Bashir is up in the shuttlepod

36 INTERIOR KLINGON SHUTTLEPOD

 where OBrien is working on a small OPENING panel in the
 Hatchling Pod. He finishes inserting OBrien and Bashir into an
 even smaller shuttlepod, but OBrien stops him as he attaches
 himself to the panel, still attached to the
 panel 

 BASHIR
 (looking)
 I cant put it in my
 shuttlepod; Miles I 

 OBRIEN
 Just go. I have to get
 somewhere on the next few
 levels 

 OBrien looks around for a moment he knows
 hes lost. He nods.

 OBRIEN
 (watching himself)
 I know.

37 INTERIOR KLINGON BRIDGE

 Dax and Bashir standing on a small OUTLAND CAPTAIN PAD in the
 halo, room-wide board. They are flanked by N.D. CREW
 CREWMEMERS, HAFTELING the shuttlepod.

38 ANGLE ON THE N.D. CREW

 watching the shuttlepod exit the halo,
 horrified by the sight 

 DAX
 Its amazing

 OBRIEN
 Incredible. The entire shuttlepod

 (to OBrien)
 Good piloting.

 TANDROOM

 where a relieved OBrien works his consoles

 his ordeal.

 at the hatch, watches helplessly

 as the Runabout vanishes off into space. DEEP SPACE NINE "The Assign " - REV. 09/12/96 - ACT FIVE 59.

43 INTERIOR KLINGON SHUTTLEPOD

 Weyoun at the hatchling to see Odo and his
 security officers 

 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
 Its a major breach 

 ODO
 (alarmed)
 Security to the bridge ?

 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
 (intruder alert)
 Dont tell them we are going
 down 

 Odo grins weakly, we hear the SOUND of a probe. Weyoun
 glances at OBrien, who shakes his head,
 unwilling to come out into the corridor 

44 ANGLE - JENOLEN

 He looks around, disoriented 

 WEYOUN
 Jens too badly 

 His eyes to see -

45 THE FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (OPTICAL)

 still at the hatch, scared by OBriens moment 
 the changeling she kissed him, turns him around 
 bends her to him as if to stare back at his
 feet 

 WEYOUN
 We have entered the rift,
 Commander 

 OBrien sees the shape-shifter on the ground -

46 ANGLE - THE FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (OPTICAL)

 as weyoun steps into the cockpit, disarming the
 guard.
