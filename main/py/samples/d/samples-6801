 JAKE

 OBRIEN
 What about her?

 JAKE

 Kressari.

 OBRIEN HAILSAR
 (to OBrien)
 Thats right. And hes 
 very important to us.

 JAKE
 (to OBrien)
 They are involved in everything we 
 are so. He has no idea what 
 you are about to see.

 OBrien nods.

 OBRIEN

 OBrien leads the charge plasma rifle into 
 his shoulder and EXITS, leaving Kira and Odo 
 behind. After a beat, Kira and Odo follow Odo out the 
 door to the holosuites one last time.

 JAKIN
 I understand, Major. And to think, 
 hes been watching you talk about 
 spying files and downloading unclassified 
 information from the computers computers hard drive.

 KIRA
 (to Odo)
 Look, we are a legitimate intelligence 
 agency with the Cardassians, 
 and we dont want to provoke the 
 Federation by sending down a 
 suicide ship.

 ODO
 Major, we know Major Kira, Major Kira isnt 
 a traitor, Major. You are a loyal 
 officer and a soldier. Theres no room 
 for speculation.

 KIRA
 Just like I said.

 ODO
 Major Kira is scheduled to arrive 
 this afternoon. So when she gets back, 
 she and her Bajor will be able to go for 
 their jobs.

 KIRA
 All right, lets get you out of 
 here.

 ODO
 But we will need a police escort for a 
 pretext. This is the regular 
 security procedure. Everyones going 
 to want a security escort to take 
 your stuff. Im willing to 
 have you arrested, Major.

 KIRA
 Im afraid thats not 
 the case today. I want you to 
 report to Security. As soon as 
 possible.

 ODO
 Major Kira knows you are under 
 a very large and very old 
 spellings about these kinds of serious 
 things, Major. Id like to 
 explain it to you.

 KIRA
 I will inform you of my plan.

 ODO
 Very well. And Commander, can 
 you tell me Major Kira isnt 
 going to like you, so to speak 

 KIRA
 Odo. Odo, listen to me 
 you dont want to be in charge here, 
 do you? Yes, I can. But in this case, 
 there needs to be a way to run a 
 solution. All right, lets see if Im 
 all right.

 Odo is smart as to answer without looking back. 
 He seems genuinely interested with Kira and Odo is suddenly uneasy 
 too. Odo checks himself and Odo decides hes in 
 something. Odo reacts, curious and looks up and down 
 at Kira he suddenly understands something.

 ODO
 Major Kira may I have a 
 word with you?

 KIRA
 No thanks.

 ODO
 You alright?

 KIRA
 Okay.

 ODO
 All right. I have learned that Major Kira 
 has been with the Bajoran Militia and 
 Im the least Federation of them so 
 I think we are here to see her again.

 ODO
 Major Kira is with me, Major. You 
 dont want her to get to Ops? 
 (to Major)
 Hold me here.

 ODO
 (to Major Kira)
 Major Major, please check your computer 
 logs and make certain Nogri 
 is right.

64 ANGLE (OPTICAL)

 Odo turns and looks at Kira - she doesnt like what hes feeling she 
 nods. A beat later, Kira lets out a long breath - "hows Nog" 
 resolves his dilemma and steps away without looking back 

 ODO
 (to Odo)
 Major Kira Major Kira and her officers 

 She smiles, sits down heavily. Odo turns back to
