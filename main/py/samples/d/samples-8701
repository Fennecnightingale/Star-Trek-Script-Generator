 Sisko is still thinking what he wants.

 SISKO
 The good news is he will be freed.

 Worf glances at the map so he can see the
 border. He leans back for a moment, his attention totally
 focussed on his work.

 WORF 
 Sir, we may intercept the operative
 at his ship point of arrival with 
 him

 DAX (O.S.)
 Sisko - I need some sort of pattern

 A few seconds later - Odo and Nog (with the new suit) making last-minute adjustments in the engines. The 
 focus of the engines is on the main viewer, and the
 secondary displays are populated by Okudagrams depicting various combinations of 
 spinning 
 energy patterns 

 As the ship is settled into orbit of the Maquis world 

 OBRIEN

 NOG 
 Im sorry, I know Nog means

 But OBriens on one of the Pads to come with his big

 as the phaser reaches overload. As the torpedo hits the 
 passageway on the Promenade, it becomes 
 a gigantic cinder the Borg now bathes in 
 "Loyal Fire" and the Borg turns to face him with
 the huge ship.

 NOG 
 What was that for?

 OBRIEN 
 Good for now 

 But before he can answer it, the Borg leaps into his 
 arms, impirring him, rocking him with
