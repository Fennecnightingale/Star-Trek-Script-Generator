 I cannot explain.
 Why ? How come you 
 here?

 GARAK
 It is not a secret.

 ODO
 We were friends for some
 reason 

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Tacking" - REV. 03/22/99 - ACT FOUR 45.

 ODO
 "Bashir" was your mentor?" I 
 was your mentor? And now you are 
 going to help us destroy a 
 Federation ship?

 Quarks jaw falls. This is meant for Quarks "off," but Quarks never 
 could say the word "defiant."

 QUARK
 A Federation ship is too 
 useful against Dukos 
 weapons.

 KIRA
 So you are saying you wanted 
 to show Dukers vulnerability?

 ODO
 Yes, I would. I wanted an 
 opportunity to prove 
 his helpless defenses.

 QUARK
 I didnt say that.

 NOG
 They are trying you in, Odo.

 Quark feels bad about this, but he knows Odo said the 
 truth.

 QUARK
 If I show that defiant, and 
 I have to show this ship, I 
 will have to live with the 
 thought that Dukat will pay me 
 to that the Defiant was simply 
 a ship for him. But I 
 would give Quarks a chance.

 KIRA
 (softly)
 Maybe I was wrong, Quark.

 QUARK
 Not a chance.

 KIRA
 I guess what if you think you 
 could be using Quarks good 
 weapons 

 QUARK
 Maybe a lot of your weapons would 
 be useful against 
 Dukok.

 KIRA
 Maybe 

 QUARK
 And you would still be 
 the best friend you 
 could have.
 (Klinking with 
 her words)
 You did have to.

 KIRA
 It must be hard, you know 
 that.

 Quarks not sure how to respond.

 QUARK
 So you came this close to 
 Dukat. What does 
 make me feel alive?
 It wasnt much of a 
 surprise, was it?
 (off her nod)
 I know. Its a good gift 
 you never received and I 
 want it to be part of your 
 life now. For a year. 
 You cant go through with the 
 destruction of your ship -

 KIRA
 Thats right, Quark.
 But I must stay, Quark. I 
 cant let you bring yourself.

 QUARK
 Theres no purpose in waiting 
 while your ship is being 
 cleared.
 (off Kiras response)
 If I can get you a Dukalan 
 weapon, I can give you it.

 to include Rom.

 ROM
 You cant even stop me?

 Quark is about to face the truth with regard that 
 isnt coming easily to Quarks advantage. However, Quarks not so 
 easily.

 QUARK
 Are you asking me if I 
 believe you? I suppose not.

39 INTERIOR DEFIANT - BRIDGE

 KIRA
 I have lost your trust, Quark. 
 Now, what if its your 
 way again?

 QUARK
 Your trust of me?

 KIRA
 The Cardassians.

 QUARK
 And the rebels.

 KIRA
 They gave me back your first 
 name. Why would you care 
 then? We are friends.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Tacking the Cardassian" - REV. 03/22/99 - ACT FOUR 46.

39 CONTINUED

 QUARK
 How the Cardassian Federation works is the 
 best. Maybe you are being a 
 war casualty, Odo, and its all 
 right, you are coming back into war 
 again. You got to be with 
 it for your good, and the Cardassians 
 started out on top.
 (to Odo)
 I dont know what to say. For you, 
 Dukats bad luck, Rom 

 Quark considers this.

 QUARK
 So if the Defiant is not equipped 
 to survive what the Ferengus 
 could have given us.

 KIRA
 Then all you say. Is 
 that Dukats to the future?
 Do you?

 QUARK
 This is Dukat. I know what you do 
 to us to kill that Dukalan 
 woman. It would be no 
 less dangerous than what
