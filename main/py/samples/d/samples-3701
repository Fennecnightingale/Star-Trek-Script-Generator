 the.

 The door opens to reveal Worf, entering by
 Khitomer. A firepit in the center of the room,
 lit only by the light, is
 lit and a tall bridge crew - including
 a Worf, Odo and a Nagus ENTER.

 NAGUS
 Worf.

 WORF
 (touched)
 This is Quark. We need a little more 
 information, Mister Sisko 

 NAGUS
 This is the Nagus. Meet me 

 WORF
 We have no business here.

 NAGUS
 Then why the hell should I be here?

 Worf doesnt answer, merely watching Quark.

 WORF
 Quark 

 Quark looks at the Naguss face blankly.

 NAGUS 
 I, Borg how did it feel?

 WORF 
 It would have been different, I-

67 EXTERIOR SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

 In the distant distance, the wormhole opens. The
 Naguss face opens.

 NAGUS
 (touched) 
 I want to see you, Quark. I want you. 
 (pointing back around to the 
 entrance, to Worf) 
 Let me in.
 (to Worf) 
 And we will meet you in a second, 
 if you do not exit.

 Worf is looking very satisfied with this.

 WORF
 (angry) 
 There does not seem to be any sign 
 of the stars surface outside, the 
 way the Naguss face appears to 
 indicate its innocence.

 NAGUS 
 A secret. It would appear the 
 Naguss eyes are not on the surface. 
 The wormhole is closing, and all the stars 
 surface is visible.

 QUARK 
 But, this wormhole is active 
 its been open to explore. And its 
 almost as if theres a vast gulf between the two 
 entrances it can only close. Quark 
 and Worf enter. Quark is surprised to see the same 
 hole in the ceiling where he, and Worf, were standing a few 
 days ago.

 NAGUS 
 (a beat) 
 I, Quark. I feel the emptiness of 
 the stars. But this tunnel, as 
 much as it might sound like a 
 yawning snake in the reptilian caverns. 
 I shall warn you first of what you are getting 
 there, if I may say so. You will both be killed.

 NGAUS
 (a nod) 
 Yes, Nagus. I would have it.

 The Naguss gesture toward the door, to Worf -

 NAGUS 
 Quark, where do you belong?

 QUARK 
 In the bridge.
 (to Worf) 
 Tell me yourself. Theres only one 
 person you know on this station you could 
 use.

 Worf looks at Worfs face.

 WORF
 (tossing his own) 
 I am a member of this crew. I have 
 a post on this station. That is, unless the Naguss 
 caves on Torias Six.

 NOGU 
 Yes, Captain. However, Im the Naguss 
 Naguss. You.

 ODO 
 By acting on the Torias 
 Six, you have made an error in your 
 duties.

 NAGUS 
 Of course I dont have the 
 post. The Naguss was on the 
 Norkova.

 NOGU 
 You are mistaken. The Naguss ship just 
 entered a wormhole directly 
 astern.

 WORF 
 The wormhole itself appears to be the 
 entrance 

 Nogu stands, looking all around at the gaping Cardassian 
 corpses. He knows where his ship is 
 and what hes about to do.

 NOGU 
 Come on. I can still see the ships 
 and I can still feel their pain. 
 But Im going to have to die 
 to set it back on Dern, and 
 the rest.
