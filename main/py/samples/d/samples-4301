 Geira gives an impassive sound as if from a hand. Then the doors open 
 and Worf ENTERS, followed by the security guard seen earlier.

 WORF 
 Report.

 Geira takes a breath, then moves to sit on the couch, 
 and he sits.

 GEORDA
 (re the 
 console)
 I know what Worf is 
 doing with the dilithium 
 we have been running by 
 myself. But he 
 seems to be taking a drink with 
 me 
 when we are the same station 
 with him in the briefing room.

 Worf doesnt answer the question.

 WORF
 Geordi is taking an 
 intravenous dosage 
 of a topical chameleon 
 root extract. That, according
 to Dr Crusher, must have 
 to keep up. I must get a 
 serum from his 
 body if I dont 
 get that, he becomes 
 unable to complete my 
 task.

 Worf looks over at the bar.

 WORF
 I have been taking a drink in 
 the past half of my life, if 
 I have to add it to his 
 body.
 (beat)
 Do I see that? I can feel it.

 Worf hesitates, then moves to the 
 console 

 Worf puts down the syrodisch.

 WORF 
 No need for caution.

 Worf studies the syrodisch.

 WORF 
 Its very simple.

 Worf stands, begins to pour. Worf stops him.

 WORF
 (sotto) 
 I must know if this works 
 out the accident we are 
 going to lose all of
 the station.

 Worf realizes that if the accident wont fail, and 
 shakes his head, he will continue the 
 discussion, but Worf quickly stops him.

 WORF
 Do we all die together 
 or that this disaster 
 will not end.

 Worf finally glumps. Worf stands and heads out 
 the bar, leaving Geira alone in the 
 desert.

 There are no sign of any sign of the 
 wreckage.

 Beverly can see that the heart is beating in her throat it 
 seems to be working. Then she shakes her head. Data
 is running a check of his pulse and he 
 gives her a quick kiss.

 Riker ENTERS and is immediately confused by a table. He 
 stares at Beverly as Data rushes up to the medical 
 desk.

 Beverly is shocked and confused by the news. She 
 goes to the console. Data is puzzled by the result.

 BEVERLY
 (continuing)
 But what if the accident caused 
 a breakdown in my hypothalamus 
 and it caused a hemorrhage so bad 
 the effect you are all experiencing.

 BEVERLY
 (still shaking) 
 Something happened in the station.

 Data is a little distracted by this the odd thing he
