======== SAMPLE 1 ========

 the field, and
 Picard is looking at it with his first
 glance. Data is studying his tricorder, as Riker
 stands and takes a few steps to Picard as Data moves
 to him.

 DATA
 All field levels are
 within normal tolerance.
 The field is also
 within normal tolerance,
 Commander.

 Picard looks relieved. Datas worried expression
 makes it appear as Riker approaches the bunker.

 WORF
 (trugged)
 This is no indication of
 sabotage or Romulan
 activity, sir.

 RIKER
 No, sir.
 (reacts)
 The power signature clearly
 came from the field, sir.
 Someone put it together
 after we arrived.

 Data considers it.

 DATA
 I understand, sir.

 RIKER
 You will have to send the
 distress call and transfer the
 coordinates of the sector,
 sir.

 DATA
 The signal should have reach
 our people within seven hundred
 thousand kilometers.

 TASHA VOICE
 And, to your people, this is
 Commander Data.

 RIKER
 (continuing)
 Data, report to my quarters.

 DATA
 Acknowledged. I will be
 aboard the Enterprise.

 RIKER
 How can we drop our shields
 without totally covering?

 DATA
 A very simple procedure of
 strengthening the magnetic
 constrain fields, the
 process would be a bit more
 difficult. This should only
 work at high warp, one thruster
 burst should suffice.

 RIKER
 Sounds right.

 DATA
 (thinks,
 shrugs)
 I will recommend that 

 Riker, Data and Tasha ENTERS, followed by Tasha, and they
 head for the exits.

34 INTERIOR THE COMPARTMENT AREA

 As they ENTER from the corridor, a weary crew is
 checking out how long they have been
 at war. Worf still hesitates to leave the
 Enterprise, but is obviously here to be
 accepted.

 DATA
 I believe they have succeeded in
 establishing communications with
 us, sir.

 DATA
 Yes, Commander.

 Worf turns to Beverly and Geordi.

 STAR TREK "The Wounded" - REV. 10/28/90 - ACT FOUR 43.

34 CONTINUED

 DATA
 I have successfully
 establishing a subspace link
 with Voyager, sir.

 Geordi begins to shake his head, but Tasha
 points out the turbolift door to the turbolift.

 TORAN
 Are you certain that Navigational
 sensors will pick up
 something here?

 DATA
 I cannot say, sir. I cannot
 believe they are working.

 Geordi heads for the exit. Data heads to
 the turbolift. Off Riker 

 CUT TO

35 INTERIOR TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)

 Data, Geordi, Tasha and Riker ENTER with the
 TRANSPORTER EFFECT. As before the Enterprise
 is on its way out of here the two of them
 are now clearly in a "blind" state,
 incapable of their proper eyes. They are
 not at all ready for battle. Tasha checks a
 monitor near a panel on the wall monitor. "Q" (as Picard
 is approaching) is inside. In the
 background, we can see a large and frightening
 object/vessel out of which, a small
 detritus. Riker stands to be in
 the center of the room, trying hard, trying vain
 to get his bearings. At the moment
 Tasha ENTERS, the bulkhead of A "SURFACE"
 materializes about four feet below
 the surface of her body. "Q" moves from
 the humanoid to the ground, out of sight, as
 Geordi follows. Tasha finds the "spaces
 Tube" by the tricobalt device, reacts as Tasha and Riker
 ENTER THE ROOM, the "spaces Tube"- as they
 STEP THROUGH

 Picard now has a view of VENOM and "Q" from the side
 of his face, as we REVEAL "SPACE
 TUNNEL" as a "bottle, a small (TECH) DEVICE
 which is attached to the bulkhead in
 an obscure recess, glowing
, and ominous-looking, GLOWING.

 Data and Geordi ENTER after a beat, Picard
 watches his phaser and tricobalt devices
 closely. The device is still attached to the bulkhead,
 and an ominous-looking ENERGY BOLTICAL POWER is
 snapping open and shut,
