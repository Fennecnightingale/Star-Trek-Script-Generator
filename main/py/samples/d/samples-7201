 OLDER BASHIR.

 And as he goes to check a panel -

57 INTERIOR HABITAT RING CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

 Where Jake meets Jake and Nog standing against the wall. Jake
 takes out his baseball and rolls down the hallway.
 Jake ends up swinging the ball at the same time.

 NOG
 Jake!

 Jake turns to find Nog standing right behind Jake. The Captain
 throws the ball away. Nog just walks right in 
 his hand at the foot of the corridor.

 NOG
 You are making a bad play for these 
 times.

 Jake smiles cheerfully.

 NOG
 You have almost to it, the old
 man.

 Jake walks again, looking for the spark - but there nog is
 too much for Jake to take offense at the compliment.

58 INTERIOR DEFIANT - ENGINEERING

 Where Nog is working at some controls. Jake is sitting on
 the floor, tossing a single piece of the baseball. Nog
 smiles good-naturedly.

 NOG
 You are a good man, Jake.

 Jake smiles, grateful for the compliment. Nog looks at Jake.

 NOG
 You are a good man.

 JAKE
 (nodding)
 Its a compliment I didnt
 think anybody could have the
 balls.

 Nog shrugs. Hes been giving him quite an onslaught since
 all this started.

 NOG
 (continuing)
 Come on, Jake you have to
 tell Captain Sisko Im sure he can
 make an offer.

 Jake smiles, grateful for the correction.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Emperors " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE 51A.

58 CONTINUED

 JAKE
 Tell him you think he will drop the
 ball to let Captain Sisko throw the
 ball.

 Nogs story turns it more convenient that that way - giving Jake
 the time to regroup.

59 INTERIOR DEFIANT - CORRIDOR

 as Nog leads Arissa to it, handing her my PADD.

 NOG
 Thats a lot of bad news for you.

 JAKE
 Tell him anything he wants to know.

 NOG
 Sure, sir.
 (beat)
 And tell him I need to know Vagh is in
 your mind, not to mention the fact
 he has the luxury of pitting him
 away.

 Jake heads over to the table and Nog is right on it.
 Jake plucks out a small, hidden MUG of food at the
 table.

 NOG
 (continuing)
 Theres one other one more question -
 can Vagh, Yuta, or even Worf want to throw
 him away? And then he turns around and
 lets the look on Nogs face.

 Nogs confidence is almost gone Nogs physical health is
 starting to fade.

 NOG
 (continuing)
 Thats all I need to know to start
 thinking about it for myself.

 JAKE
 All right.

 Jake looks at him and Nog looks back into normal
 behavior.

 NOG
 (continuing)

 Its Nogs first thought that what we are doing
 here is right.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Emperors " - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT FIVE 52.

59 CONTINUED

 Just then, the USS Defiant is SHAKING strongly - its
 NOG.

 NOG
 Their shields are weakening.

 Nog suddenly realizes theres a weapon in his
 hand (the Oranthos the one we have
 always trusted), but the look between him and Nogs
 eyes goes to Jake. Nog takes up the rifle and
 checks the weapons in his hand.

 NOG
 We had to bring it this.

 OLDER BASHIR
 What?

59A NOG

 Shit on the rifle and the communicator
 interface.

59B WIDER

 Nog checks himself out - its Nogs, hes got it.

 NOG
 They are responding to the transmission.

 OLD Jake stands up, aims the 

59C NEW ANGLE

 as Nog FIRES the weapon in Jake, but Nog misses,
 going down the corridor with another hit.

60 OMITTED

60A OLD JAKE AND NOG

 Nogs dying in one-man-size holes in the
 bulkhead opposite side, the Oranthos
 still having trouble getting over his feet. Nog
 tries to grab Jake away, but Jake stops him.

 NOG
 (urgent)
 Jake, I wasnt coming.

 Jake helps Nog squeeze Jake back. Nog covers
