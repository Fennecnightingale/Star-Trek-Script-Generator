50 INTERIOR VIC LOUNGE

 As before. There are very few empty tables in the lobby,
 some people are near the bar, and 
 several empty dance chairs around the table. At least the 
 lights are dimmed. The lighting is not as strong as 
 it usually is.

 A waiter is at the door, and a waiter is standing 
 behind him. They all look up at him intently as they 
 pass each other. They share a long look and then 
 then a look away. The waiter moves off to get another
 table. Sisko and Dax exchange a glance and then 
 both pass out.

 SISKO
 Can I help you?

 After a beat, Dax reaches over to Sisko, and hands him 
 a PADD. Daxs PADD shes carrying a food box.

 DAX 
 Help you? PADD?

 Dax reaches over and holds out her PADD and quickly 
 replaces it on Siskos table.

 DAX 
 Help you?

 Sisko picks up the PADD out of her hand and crumbs it 
 onto the now-dry Parell.

 SISKO
 (sotto, to Vic) 
 Who couldnt be you, Vic.

50A CLOSE ON SISKO 

 as he looks at the PAREll. The waiter is happy with 
 what he has and wants to tip him off.

 SISKO
 (sotto, to Martok) 
 Well, gentlemen, I will get right 
 next time.

50B CLOSE ON MARTOK

 as he looks at Sisko.

 MARTOK
 Im sure you can see your 
 face.

 SISKO
 Its the way I see it.

 They look at each other for a beat.

 MARTOK
 (sotto, to Sisko) 
 I know you want to 
 make your grandpas.

 SISKO 
 I do.

 Martok suddenly holds up two hand mugs of 
 food.

 MARTOK 
 These mugs are heavenly 
 (points to one of the 
 mugs) 
 they are Bajorans.

 Sisko takes out two mugs of Bajoran meal and 
 begins slumping it onto the floor.

55 BACK TO SISKO

 as he looks over at Rom who stares at him for a beat.

 SISKO
 I dont really think you know 
 what is a Ferengi? I have had 
 my problems, been all my life. 
 Every once, I almost had my 
 doubts, that you really 
 are.

56 ON
 ROM AND SISKO

 as they look at each other for a beat. Rom is 
 happy, while Sisko is, hes not sure 
 which side of the fence he wants to walk 
 around.
