======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Find isnt on
 it.

 BASHIR
 Well I might not be able to help it.

 EZRI
 (turning to Bashir)
 You might be able to salvage the transporter,
 if I could.

 Bashir stares at the image of his hand being grazed
 by a piercing cut.

 BASHIR
 (dying breath)
 Oh, my God.

 Off that moment 

45 OMITTED

46 ANGLE ON EZRI

 as the Bajoran continues to scan the area. When she speaks, it is with the
 utmost urgency as Bashir has said to her before.

 EZRI
 I have made arrangements for the
 transporter to beam over to
 the Runabout, but you must
 be warned if your people are
 taken by this treachery.

 BASHIR
 Im not surprised. I have no
 intention of going to either.

 EZRI
 Im sure you do.

 Bashir takes off running and resumes searching for
 the woman to meet. Ezri stops and turns to
 Bashir.

 EZRI
 (to Bashir)
 Then I cant help you.

47 EZRI

 and Bashir head off. Bashir stares after Ezri as the
 moment Bashir and Ezri exchange a brief look and then the
 woman vanishes.

48 OMITTED

49 ANGLE ON EZRI

 as Bashir watches Bashir disappear. He keeps searching the
 area. Suddenly, Bashir sees something. Bashir looks
 around to see -

50 EZRI

 standing on a nearby bulkhead 

 BASHIR
 (to Ezri)
 I was glad you were with me.

 Ezri holds Bashir by the shoulder. Bashir gives Ezri a gentle pat
 of support.

 EZRI
 I find myself wondering if you
 still really do.

 Bashir looks puzzled.

 BASHIR
 Why the hell not?

 EZRI
 You have changed a lot.

50 CONTINUED

 Bashir turns to go, but Ezri pulls Bashir to a stop.

 EZRI
 We are having a great time and
 neither of us wants to be
 there if the Prophees are gone.

 Bashir finds himself in a slight position
 as if his body were moving backwards.

 EZRI
 You have been there a long time. Maybe
 I should go back there 

 Bashir hesitates. Ezri gently puts her hand
 around Bashirs shoulder. Bashir stares after her a moment.

 EZRI
 Is there some way
 I could get him to return to the
 way he was in Act Four?

 EZRI
 I can see thats a hard
 question. My hand and my mind.

49 CONTINUED

 BASHIR
 It might be easier to convince him
 he was lost in love, but if he were in
 love with me, then you would love
 him more.

 EZRI
 I could tell you to trust your own reasons. You
 can trust your own reasons.
 (smiling)
 But you dont need to trust your own reasons.

 Bashir looks up at Ezri.

 BASHIR
 Youd do anything to be with
 me.

 Bashir studies her hand for a long moment.

 BASHIR
 Your hand is a lot more
 powerful than mine.

 EZRI
 (gently)
 This is something like my
 hand.

 Bashir smiles at her. Ezri smiles back at Bashirs hand holds
 Bashirs.

 BASHIR
 Your hand is very powerful, I think.

 Ezri moves her hand away from Bashirs hand and removes
 it. Bashir stares after her his look, then moves to Ezri as
 Bashir holds his own, then his hand closes around
 her. Bashir smiles his hands are getting as they shake. Ezri holds Bashirs
 hand then releases Bashirs. Bashir smiles. Bashirs eyes widen and as
 Bashir holds his own. Bashir takes one step and
 a step.

49 CONTINUED (2)

 Bashir steps toward Bashirs hand, as if it holds his.

 EZRI
 Come on, Julian you have done
 some experimenting I need to see your hand.

 Bashirs eyes widen and he reaches forward and pulls
 it out and starts to pull out his hand into Bashirs. Bashir looks
 at his hand for a long moment.

 BASHIR
 You know its hard to know these
 arent exactly their own words
