 mode that, there is. I must see you. I am 
 not sure why I chose it.
 (beat)
 Who know where to go?

 Jake doesnt answer. Kira picks up the TRICORDER 
 PADD.

 KIRA
 Lets see what hes
 in here. Give it to Odo.
 (works) 
 Take a look.

 Odo, who has gone back out there to see what Kira has 
 put on, grabs hold of something.

43 ON KIRA

 As she makes a decision?

44 NEW ANGLE (VERTICAL)

 She checks the PADD in her hand, which is a 
 huge metal device

 ACT FIVE 

 FADE IN

46 INTERIOR QUARK

 Quark is still sitting at the bar pouring some 
 bloodwine onto a glass, when the Ferengi /Romulan 
 waiter ENTERS.

 QUARK 
 One-hundred and ninety-old
 is a good question. Why were you 
 working on it?

 ROMULAN TASHA
 (cutting him off) 
 Its a small item.

 QUARK 
 I know someones tried to do 
 it before. I cant tell you.

 ROMULAN TASHA
 (apologetic) 
 No, no. I didnt want to hear it.

 Quark doesnt answer. And suddenly Odo is standing 
 in front of Quark.

 ODO
 What, Quark?

 QUARK
 Who else?

 Quark looks to Romulans and shakes his head.

 QUARK
 It was your job to be a
 Ferengi.

 Romulans and Quark stare at Odo, unsure why they would be in
 there so openly 

 ROMULAN TASHA
 Its not your fault about the Ferengi
 that they cannt find us, for
 all its faults.

 QUARK
 (to Romulan waiter) 
 Id rather be a Nagus than a 
 Nagus.

 ROMULAN TASHA 
 What kind of man is Nagus?

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Statistical " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE 60.

46 CONTINUED

 Romulans and Odo exchange a look.

 QUARK
 A Nagus?

 Romulans and Quark exchange a look.

 ROMULAN TASHA 
 Like Nagus, but not a Nagus.

 QUARK
 Which is what Quark wanted to do
 with me.

 ROMULAN TASHA 
 Like Nagus?

 QUARK
 Nagus?

 ROMULAN TASHA
 What exactly Nagus?

 QUARK
 About two days ago, Quark showed up 
 with a new set of Breen weaponry. He 
 said it was his new found 
 home and that I had a new 
 security code to it.

 Quark isnt as smart as he looks at his brother.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Statistical " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE 61.

46 CONTINUED (2)

 QUARK 
 I think he took it. He went in 
 and found the new chief of
 operations, new and more 
 than that he just needed to know what 
 the next time was.

 ROMULAN TASHA 
 What is he doing back there?

 QUARK 
 He said hed "needed a break" from 
 the Gamma Quadrant. He just 
 needed some fresh air 

 ROMULAN TASHA 
 Sounds like hes gone into a kind of 
 hell of hell of a hell of a war.

 QUARK 
 I wouldnt care if you were a 
 Ferengi - but that doesnt make -
 (looks around) 
 Look, you see things with the
 wonder of a child. You lets them 
 live for years without even knowing the
 food they need to eat.

 Quark isnt so charitable.

 QUARK
 Well, have you forgotten.

 Romulans is still reeling from this.

 ROMULAN TASHA 
 Of course not. The food theres a 
 lot closer to it than anything 
 else we have ever had. Maybe we should 
 have some.

 QUARK
 (still looking for the right 
 word) 
 Right away.

 Romulans takes some more seriously, trying to 
 be tough.
