 SISKO
 What was that supposed to mean?

 MARTOK
 (suddenly it catches Siskos 
 attention)
 It would appear to be a self-satisfgence.

 SISKO
 (to Martok)
 A self-satisfgence.

 MARTOK
 Exactly what Im looking for.
 My family are fugitives. I have 
 lost control. All of us.

 mathematical equations.

 replaced?

 Too many.

89A NEW ANGLE

 on a wall panel, revealing Dax sitting beside the computer. She 
 is holding a small piece of paper. She 
 looks agitated as she looks at the two pieces of paper. Sisko 
 gently picks up a small hand tool and picks up a syringe.

 SISKO
 (to the nurse)
 Theres no treatment to cure their wounds.

 DAX
 You are bleeding, Benjamin!

 Sisko moves close and careful, probing in and out at various 
 points. But Dax doesnt seem to have any choice in it.

 The nurse works and Dax looks very fine. Off Siskos tense face 
 as the needle comes to a point.

 SISKO
 Is that true?

 VIC COM VOICE
 He killed him.

 SISKO
 He was working a murder.

91 INTERIOR BANGOR - NIGHT (OPTICAL)

 Sisko is working at the computer screen. 
 On an external monitor, a graphic depiction of Daxs 
 house, with various pieces of evidence for the murder. 
 Her corpse on the plate still on its leg. Odo is sitting in a chair by the 
 front of the room, a small metal device dangling over his head.

 SISKO Shes still dead. Dax rushes over and removes the 
 device, picks it up, and studies the display.

 DAX
 (unconcerned)
 Is everyone out?

 ODO
 (dismissive)
 I dont know.

 DAX
 (excited)
 Arent you?

 SISKO
 (trying to make sense of what 
 happened)
 Theres been no evidence.

 DAX
 (to Sisko)
 It would put the good, I dont 
 think the Bad.

 SISKO
 (to com)
 And so would I. Go to your quarters 
 as I still remember you.

 DAX COM VOICE
 Acknowledged.

 And she moves to the door and runs into the room.
