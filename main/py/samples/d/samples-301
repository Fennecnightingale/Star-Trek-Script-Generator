Theres some sort of connection here

Theres a connection with the
current, the

connections

This
connections

Here is the best way I know of
connecting all four of us together

There is no way to connect it all
together as a matter of
consciousness or not, all we are
like is the sound of our
voice.
But it sounds like the sound of our voices
being heard.

Now all of this sounds very
personal.

But theres an aspect of our
dialogues that does work

All four of us have to accept the
truth in that

The truth that a sentient being can be an
instrument, and we are all
instrumentally connected, but I need to say
that the sound of the voice

being heard is the most personal thing I have ever
heard, my ears, my heart, my

and my brain.

And if I have to go somewhere to
conver with myself, Im in trouble.

Bridge, Commander.

LWXANA
No, please.

ARCHER
 I wish it were that simple, I guess.
There have to be more things 

 Archer nods.

 Archer to the helm.

ARCHER
 (checking system)
 Theres been one system change at a time.
 (they hold)
 Commander, Commander to the bridge.

(Bridge)

ARCHER (OC)
 Sir, I never would have predicted that.
 What are you telling me? You never
would have been interested?

(Bridge)

ARCHER
 I would have never say that to you.

(He checks the systems and they go to warp.)

ARCHER
 We are still in the battle.
 We are a threat, just as we were, you are. (theres more change. They stay on course, they turn again and the captain says a final test.)
 Theres a feeling of urgency to all of these.

(Shipyards)

(A shuttlecraft is in orbit around, and the shuttlecrafts been
disassembled into a number of pieces.)
ARCHER
 You are here, you are here at all the right
attention spots and they cannot be ignored.
This vessel will never be stopped.
(Tuckers office)

ARCHER (OC)
 Do I have to bring this aboard?
(The shuttlecraft has been reassembled into a numberless pieces.)
ARCHER
 But you will be taking it to warp.
 (Arktormus and his crew go to warp and the shuttlecrafts been reconstructed into
a shuttlecraft.)
ARCHER
 That is why she needs to get down to the surface.
This is the only way.

(Arktor and his crew start to make the first contact with the Enterprise, but before
they can reach the shuttlecraft, they are hit by another shuttlecraft and their holodeck is shattered by it. They are left behind on a piece of garbage.)
ARCHER
 Your transporter controls are locked
on.

(Bridge)

ARCHER
 Engage.

(The shuttlecraft is now in warp.)

(An arm goes around two legs and activates the computer systems lock.)
ARCHER
 Im locking.

(Arktormus goes for the door.)

(Arktor and his crew use their communicators systems to activate the lock.)
ARCHER
 Engage.
(The shuttlecraft is ready to go. They run an activation sequence and the Holodeck is
unattended by anyone, and the Holodeck collapses into some kind of mess.)

(The Holodeck collapses into a stack of pieces. A woman takes the whole thing and tries to clean up. The computer systems have
failed.
The holodeck collapses into an even more chaotic state.)
(One of the pieces collapses, then collapses into dust. It tries to regain its shape, but this is too far too fast and we are in need of a Holodeck to get it back on the
screen. But it falls straight down the shaft and falls into deep storage.)
ARCHER
 (OC)
 If I can get it back to the Holodeck by altering
the holodeck code, I can remove the Holodeck. I can change to the
Holodeck code, and if I can create it, I can take it away from the Holodeck.

(The Holodeck is reassembled into something resembling a humanoid machine. The
holodeck computer code is recreated as if it was created into
