 The ship is ROCKED by HITS as it reacts.

(Engineering)

KIM (OC) Acknowledged. Chakotay to Chakotay. Stand by.

(Science Station)

KIM You are lying. KIM No one on Earth
trusts you.

 And as Chakotay reacts his anger begins to boil over to get him outside
to find Sisko, on his way out of the program, looking on at least two

KIM It looks like there have been
two Starfleet ships entering this system
since the beginning - on my signal, and

to the signal. Their ships are moving.

(Shuttlecraft)

KIM KIM You are coming close enough to Treenan space.

KIM What are you planning?


 DEEP SPACE NINE "What You " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FOUR 45.

 KIM (OC) Its about the whole romance between you
