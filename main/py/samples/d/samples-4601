 Mister you I just want to 
 hope you are prepared to face 
 your own destiny alone.

 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
 All right, you are about to 
 prepare yourself for the 
 Dominion.

 Riker nods. She moves to the door and takes 
 a step inside.

 Sisko ENTERS. Jake is pacing, his mood is somber - like a 
 nervous teenager on a sugarwagon.

 SISKO 
 What can I say?

 JAKE 
 You have got your life, Dad.

 SISKO 
 We have got to do our job now.

 JAKE 
 Dad lets do it.

 SISKO 
 We are not in Starfleet uniform.

 JAKE 
 Sure.

 SISKO
 I suppose I could give you an order.

 JAKE 
 But if you cant handle the 
 situation, you will have no choice 
 but to make a run. The JemHadar 
 are killing everyone on this 
 station. Im not sure about it - 
 I dont want to lose anyone.

 SISKO 
 I know you all, son.
 (beat) 
 My crews in trouble. Maybe 
 theres something Starfleet did to 
 handle that, too - at least something they 
 should know, you know 

 JAKE 
 They dont want to kill us all. 

 (sighs) 
 I wish they werent waiting for us to 
 pick a fight 

 Sisko holds up a PADD. Jake reads, and as 
 hes about to resume reading

 I need you to pull this

 OBRIEN 
 They are hailing us.

 RIKER
 OBrien, lets try them again

53 INTERIOR SICKBAY (OPTICAL)

 Bashir and Dax are having a discussion about 
 the same day they appear on the Bridge. Bashir 
 is pacing down at their positions, deep in thought and 
 hes just about thinking that they are all stuck 
 somewhere.

 BASHIR
 We need your medical attention. 
 We werent aware, theres no 
 way you can really get your 
 advice to me.

 Bashir looks over from them for a beat.

 BASHIR 
 I can barely make it here to 
 these ships, Julian as much.

 BASHIR 
 How could you have known it? 
 Dax, listen to me, this is 
 a long time ago, this is not a time 
 you were there the last of all, 
 Miles. I was there during 
 the evacuation. All those people who 
 evacuated came here in 
 the first wave, the 
 survivors did not go there.

 Bashir turns and looks at his parents.

 BASHIR 
 We are on a mission to the 
 Delta Quadrant Its going to take a 
 long time to get into your computer 
 and identify where its supposed to the 
 Defiant. You hear me out.

 Dax sits down and Bashir walks over to her husband.

 DAX 
 Julian?

 BASHIR 
 Im here all of you.

 Bashir stops and turns to go off.

 BASHIR 
 Whatd you want?

 DAX
 Doctor
