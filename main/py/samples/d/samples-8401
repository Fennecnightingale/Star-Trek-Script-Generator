 (to Gowron, on screen)
 What is it?

 GOWRON (O.S.)
 (to Worf and Worf)
 With courage -

 WORF (O.S.)
 I have given you back to us -

 Gowron glances up, realizes that the humans are
 in trouble, but hes determined not to allow them into the
 mission.

 GOWRON (contd)
 I ask again, gentlemen a
 Starfleet captain should have been
 sent to Morgron to restore
 the glory of our people. I want to
 send Worf to retake the
 Empire.

 Picard in the chair, seated at the desk. The door CHIMES for

 (to com)
 This is an ancient Klingon
 word. "We." We are here because
 of your unexpected
 entry into the archive.

 We found no indication of a

87A INTERIOR ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE TURBOLIFT

 Picard ENTERS from Sickbay - Worf steps out of the
 Lift. Picard looks up.

 WORF
 I have examined every
 possible word in your log.

 Picard almost jumps at the wrong time as he hears what
 must have happened.

 Picard begins to read his own thoughts.

 PICARD
 I take it you and the
 others are at work on the
 ships command.

 WORF
 The word is that I am
 on board. You must be
 very happy.

 Worf has to draw a few curious looks at Picard, as though
 hes trying to grasp at the unexpected weight of his
 decision.

 WORF
 I am glad I was with
 Captain Picard on the day
 of my death.

 Picard smiles.

 PICARD
 It must seem a little overwhelming.
 It was a remarkable experience.

 WORF
 As I thought it would be if
 you had felt like doing the same
 thing for me.

 Picard glances up.

 PICARD
 Yes. I must admit, there was a
 possibility.

 WORF
 (wry)
 But what would a man achieve if he
 stood before the Great Tree?

 Picard takes a beat.

 PICARD
 (thoughtfully)
 A hope.

 WORF
 And what would that be exactly?

 A hope which can never turn its
 head

 To change the heart.

 A beat.

 PICARD
 And hope.

 WORF
 But what about losing the dead?

 Picard glances around the Bridge, making sure there are
 no one else here.

 PICARD
 A Klingon warrior does not let
 face his destiny.

 Worf looks at him.

 WORF
 The Klingon High Council would
 refuse to accept that
 possibility.
