======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Have-go 
 on all of you, let us all in our 
 arms, give each of you good-bye, 

 And as the JemHadar make their way onto their 
 ship -

63 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

 as two large ships move in formation around it.

64 OMITTED

65 D.S. TURNS (FORMERLY SCENE 56)

 The ships turn to a steep and perilous 
 ascent.

66 ANGLE - THE FORUM (FORMERLY SCENE 57)

 A large set of text boxes, containing the work
 instructions, are being tossed back and forth by Nuria and the rest
 of them as part of the conversation is completed.

 D.S. TURNS

 A thoughtful moment between them, then

 D.S. TURNS
 (forming as she
 remembers feeling)
 You have done a great service to
 the Empire.

 But then she turns to go and as her eyes lock on Kira -

 KIRA
 You know, Im a firm believer 

 DAX
 (nodding)
 No one ever said anything about
 the Empire that I knew.

 D.S. TURNS
 Thats not true, either.

 KIRA
 Do you remember when the Cardassians
 first started destroying the people?

 DEEP SPACE NINE "When the Bough Ripped Off
 Shorts?" - REV. 12/05/98 - ACT FOUR 41.

65 CONTINUED

 DAX
 (softly)
 All my life, I have been forced to stop 
 working for the Empire. You know 

 KIRA
 Its clear youre not happy.

 DAX
 (gently, to Nuria)
 I never imagined that happening.
 (a beat, to Odo)
 Then, youd better come and 
 join us.

 Nuria nods and Odo leads the rest out 

 The rest of the conversation continues on its downward 
 slope 

 D.S. TURNS

 And as the three rise to the passageway -

 ADI
 What the hells going on?

 KIRA
 The Cardassians have just destroyed the Empire 
 you will never get another 
 shot 
 (a beat, to Nuria)
 What kind of soldiers do we have left 

 They move to walk down the far side of the 
 passageway, then turn and go back inside.

66 CERA SHOT (FORMERLY SCENE 58)

 shows the three departing soldiers, the others standing 
 to defend the passageway.

67 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (FORMERLY SCENE 119)

 by the shuttlepod.

68 INTERIOR BAJORAN FIRE CAVES - MAIN CAVER

 Dukat stands before the fiery canyon. Sisko is
 there to see him. Dukat stands before the 
 hill. Both of them carry the lantern and are on fire.

69 ANGLE - KIRA

 as she stands. Kira and Odo ENTER, 
 and follow in the two other Cardassians.

 FADE IN

70A EXTERIOR BASEBALL FIELD (FORMERLY SCENE 120)

 as Dukat stands at the third base line of 
 spectators.

 KIRA
 (to Dukat)
 We have got the pitcher!

 Dukat steps out of his box. KIRA
 On your feet.

 Dukat stands in the box. He looks back at her, a cold, hard 
 expression. If it were one of the old boys who 
 stood there to do it, he wouldnt have been able to
 finish the game or throw a single an 
 game or throw anything at a game.

 KIRA
 This is ridiculous. I would have 
 gotten you killed!

 DUKAT
 You had to be kidding. Now that 
 everyone knows what happened, I have 
 the advantage.

 Dukat stands there silently, eyes on his father for a 
 beat then 

 KIRA
 How could they do that?

DAX
 You cant do this - I dont
 belong here.

 DAX
 You are saying hes not
 belonging here - thats
