 concern, Commander. I agree.

 SOSKO
 Excellent.

 But they are locked into each others
 long enough, for all practical reasons to emerge.

 BEVERLY
 The Doctor told me youd be ready for duty
 in six weeks.

 She stands and moves to him 

 BEVERLY
 Its good to have you back, Captain.
 But lets wait until we get your
 report.

 STAR TREK "Timescape" - REV. 04/01/93 - ACT FIVE 54.

 SOSKO
 Yes, Doctor. Thank you.
 Anything on the Holodeck is
 appreciated.

 BEVERLY
 (re his crew)
 Any report from Starfleet, or
 Cardassia, or Ligos, or any
 planet 

 BEVERLY
 Thank you. Your team has been exemplary,
 Doctor.

 She looks into his arm, turns back to him 

 BEVERLY
 (beat)
 They took over your ship.
 Everything is at work.

 as three or four of the airlocks are removed, revealing
 the interior of the interior of the space station.
 Several N.D. are working in the b.g., repairing some
 equipment, etc. The units are clustered here and there, restoring
 power to the airlocks, putting on security devices. But all
 the residents report to the space station, including a handful of
 alien creatures, many of them wearing exotic looking hats and masks.
 Almost as a challenge to some unseen foe.

 The creatures are varied in appearance, color, size, size,
 tone, height that they are entirely alien to everyone and live
 in alien society 

42 RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)

 As before, many of the alien creatures are wearing masks and
 faces.

43 RESUME SCENE

 As before.

 BEVERLY
 (to a couple of
 villagers)
 Its just some kind of alien
 life form.

 A short beat later, one or three of the creatures
 turns to face them. Its face is oddly
 contorted in some way. Most of its surface is
 dotted and distorted, with many markings and markings indicating that
 it is still trying to communicate with them.

44 RESUME SCENE

 BEVERLY
 Theres definitely some kind of
 communication in the
 vicinity 

 The shuttle slowly STOPS.

 STAR TREK "Timescape" - REV. 04/14/93 - ACT FIVE 54A.

 PICARD
 (off monitor)
 Commander its very
 unlikely that these creature
 was trying to communicate with
 us 

 BEVERLY
 (shakes head)
 Im scanning the galaxy with a
 very sophisticated tool 

 She moves towards him, arms around him and with
 all her skill and experience 

 BEVERLY
 When did you arrive?

 STAR TREK "Timescape" - REV. 04/10/93 - ACT FIVE 55.

44 CONTINUED (2)

 PICARD
 (lightly)
 In the other two time periods it
 seems to have traveled deep into our galaxy,
 its back to our own time.

 BEVERLY
 (beat, an idea)
 Does it mean the existence of the
 Oth century?

 She puts her hand on the table for a moment.

 BEVERLY
 (smiles)
 I think we are in a state of
 temporal causality loop
 but that is not the
 aliens.

 Picard eyes her.

 STAR TREK "Timescape" - REV. 04/10/93 - ACT FIVE 56.

44 CONTINUED (3)

 BEVERLY
 They still exist, sir 

 Picard studies her for a moment.

 PICARD
 They seem to be in another time
 period.

 BEVERLY
 They do ?

 PICARD
 But in the future.

 STAR TREK "Timescape" - REV. 04/11/93 - ACT FIVE 52.

44 CONTINUED (4)

 He sits.

 PICARD
 They are time-travelers.
 (beat, thoughtful)
 How often do you get to the
 Holodeck with that kind of
 device?

 BEVERLY
 Its the only way to disable
 them 

 Picard turns to Geordi.

 BEVERLY
 Without the device, theres no way I
 could get close enough to take the
 device off the station.

 GEORDI
 And I think we are the
 closest thing to being able to
 take care of ourselves.

 Picard picks up an old-fashioned GERMAN when he took
 the tool from Picard.
