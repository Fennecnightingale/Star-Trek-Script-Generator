======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I
 I was thinking of putting together a
 few minutes later. But
 theres so much to learn. We each
 have to teach you
 something.

 Quark nods at that thought.

 QUARK
 (continuing
 thoughts)
 Do you think it has been an exciting
 experience?

 QUARK (Contd)
 When you finished reading your report
 on the Stargazer explosion, I
 realized that my entire race
 was made up of Ferengis. Not
 only did I see the Humans, but
 every one of the F.C.A. that
 stood at its end had its own needs.

 Quark trails off abruptly struck by something Quark
 cant make out.

 BRUNT (O.S.)
 Did this report on the attack break
 the rules?

 QUARK
 Yes, but I didnt care what you
 wanted to know, because I wanted to
 keep our friendship alive.

 BRUNT
 Of course, you did want to keep
 that friendship alive all in one place isnt
 it? That all the F.C.A. on that
 planet wants to be with its own people,
 right? The only question is how do
 the F.C.A. fit all those
 requirements?

 QUARK
 You are not Ferengi, are you? You just
 dont like what happened. I thought it
 might hurt them to the way it was 

 BRUNT
 We are not like F.C.A. or the
 Klingons, or any of these people
 We have evolved. We can live in good
 relationships, no matter what we are
 like. And we can be what we are. How do
 we succeed without violating someones
 strict rules?

 QUARK
 What do you mean?

 BRUNT
 (continuing)
 Just because our social and economic
 infrastructure 

 QUARK
 And we cant just stand by those
 conditions. But if we have a
 strong vision where
 you want to be, we can always
 take we are about to.

 BRUNT (O.S.)
 But we cannot just stand by the
 F.C.A. for that long.
 (off Quarks 
 surprised 
 reaction)
 Just because we do it makes us both
 uncomfortable.

 QUARK
 Im not just talking about the
 F.C.A.B.A.G. I have already
 identified some F.C.A.A. B.M. (
 female, not F.C.)

73 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

 A Ferengi appears. The F.C.A.G. takes this as her
 test sample.

 F.C.A.G. (CONTROMONIC)
 Welcome aboard, sir.

 She moves to the F.C.A.E. stand near the rail,
 staring at the empty air, then turns and walks past.

74 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

 Leaving orbit.

75 INTERIOR QUARK (OPTICAL)

 Looking down at the empty air once again on a
 Ferengi-pres dream of a better future.

 QUARK
 You think the F.C.A.G. would stand by
 and allow itself another attack?

 F.C.A.G. (CONTROMONIC)
 You think it does.


 STAR TREK "Times Orphan" - REV. 3/13/97 - ACT FOUR 45.

75 CONTINUED

 QUARK
 No, I dont want to talk to them.

 F.C.A.G. (CONTROMONIC)
 I would like to be with them all in my
 life. But F.C.A.G. doesnt want to
 make that decision. He thinks of the
 F.C.C.A.G. as being the ultimate
 decision in the universe.

 It is a difficult concept for F.C.A.G. to understand, but he finds
 it hard to accept.

 QUARK
 What did you say, F.C.A.G. (CONTRIMORIC)
 Why is the F.C.A.G. (CONTRIMORIC)
 (continuing)
 If this has its flaws, there
 are only one fix. Is that
 clear?

 QUARK
 Not altogether.

 The F.C.
