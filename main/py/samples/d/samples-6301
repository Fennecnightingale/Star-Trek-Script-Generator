 to at least
 hold a few. You will be able to
 continue your fight for justice.

 ZEK
 I was never offered that fighting

 PICARD
 I am offered another opportunity to
 fight more than continue my fight
 for my right. You will have the first
 chance to defend your race just as I will.
 That will have a real advantage and
 your death will have a chance to live
 a life. I believe in you,
 Captain. You are a strong
 and noble race. I believe in the
 Federation.

 ZEK
 If you have given me my life
 in exchange for two years
 of oppression I can promise you that
 will not happen again. Once my trial is
 over, you will lose more than just
 imprisonment and death.
 (beat)
 I die for the truth.

 PICARD
 I will die for the same thing.

 He reacts.

 DATA
 (to Picard)
 Captain.

 They both fall to the deck. The others go clink
 glasses.

 DATA
 (continuing)
 It is a dishonorable death.
 It will not last.

 They exchange a long look and go for a drink.

52 INTERIOR BRIDGE

 The Bridge and the staff are gathered as they watch as the
 JemHadar ship starts its devastating attack. A flash,
 the ship goes to Red Alert.

 RIKER
 We need every able-bodied crewman
 at their post.

 A grim beat - and they know it. Data
 studies his console for a moment, then touches a
 control on the console.

 DATA
 (continuing)
 Lieutenant Yar,
 Captain - I recommend you beam
 all crewmen to their
 quarters.

 Riker nods.

53 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

 As the JemHadar ships pound at the Federation ships, the
 Enterprise EXPLODES, leaving behind a planet or
 satellite image.

54 ON BRIDGE
 A violent display of firepower.

 The lights go out for a moment.

 RIKER
 Phasers full.

 RIKER
 Stand down your weapons.

 As they react, we 

 CUT TO

55 INTERIOR JEMHADAR BATTLESHIP

 as it is being battered. There is a crack in one of the
 exposed bulkheads. After a beat, a LARGE CONERTION
 starts flashing. The ship is JOLTED
 for a moment, then starts to MOVEL
 OUT of frame.

 STAR TREK "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT SEVEN 97.

54 CONTINUED

 DATA (Contd)
 (beat)
 (continuing)
 This is the only evacuation in
 twenty-three hours you will
 have forty-six minutes, thirty-two
 minutes x. Now!

 A beat, the Enterprise falls silent and stays.
 Its over. Data EXITS. Riker tries to get to
 Conn. The ship is ROCKED again, but it still
 cant shake him. He takes a few steps to help out
 the stabilization process.

54A INTERIOR BRIDGE

 Riker is watching the viewscreen.

 PICARD
 The evacuation wont last longer.
 You will have to make sure you
 can get out of there in twenty-two
 minutes 

 DATA
 (quietly)
 I have thirty-three minutes 

54A CONTINUED

 Data is impatient with the question.

 He continues to stare at the screen.

 DATA
 I will not allow you the time to
 make the evacuation. I will fight
 to regain control of the ship.

 RIKER
 (frowns)
 I know.

 Data continues to stare off the main viewer 

 CUT TO

55 INTERIOR JEMHADAR BATTLESHIP

 as the ship comes to a halt, facing a huge CONERTION.
 After a beat 

 STAR TREK "Gambit, Part I" - REV. 08/30/93 - ACT SEVEN 98.

55 CONTINUED (2)

 DATA
 I will attempt to calculate the
 optimal distance between the
 Enterprise and the rest of the
 shuttlecraft.

 Riker holds for a beat. He doesnt like to have
 to fight with his friend.

 DATA
 (continuing)
 I may need to fight.

 RIKER
 (quickly)
 No. Why will you do this?

 DATA
 (continuing)
 I do not. I will die if I can
 get my life back.

 Riker lets him go with a look - thats all he has
