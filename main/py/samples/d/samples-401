48C EXTERIOR SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

 A space-traveling starship, as seen in the "Space Seed" story. It forms in orbit.

 The ship takes another orbit and 
48D INTERIOR ENTERPRISE RING CORRIDOR

 Riker and OBrien wait in the hallway for the first time they
 see the ship in orbit.

 RIKER
 (to Worf)
 How do you know you 

 OBRIEN 
 We have no time for the details.

 RIKER
 Then let us try a simple one. We
 will say that the ship orbits the moon.

 OBrien nods, steps back and turns to go 

 Worf turns their attention to the door, turns to look 
 them over. But hes already gone 

48E INTERIOR ENTERPRISE BAY - CORRIDOR

 Worf turns down the stairs, walks across the Bridge 
 to the Transporter Room 

 OBOYAN
 Wait a minute. 
 (beat)
 I did a small-scale, off-the-grid test
 of the new ship 

 The doors open and OBrien EXITS the turbolift.

48F INTERIOR ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR

 The door opens and OBriens eyes flicker open 
 as he notices his ship taking another orbit.

 OBRIEN 
 Im sorry. I willnt be able to get a chance 
 to get to the Enterprise until we get
 there.

 He turns and moves off the Bridge as Worf moves to his
 station.

 WORF
 Commander!

 Worf checks the engines 

 Worf moves to his station, picks up a PADD, pulls it out.

 WORF 
 Theres no time for such pointless detail 

 WORF 
 A pity.

 RIKER 
 Theresnt there something you can use?

 OBRIEN 
 I cant use it, at least not for a very 
 long time  If we get to keep you going 
 longer it will make you a more 
 skilled trader.

 Worf begins to work his station 

 WORF 

 Dont worry, sir. Theres no room for 
 you here you cant stay 

 RIKER   (smiles) 
 Good luck.

 And Worf starts work 

 Worf turns to Worf 

 WORF 
 Good-bye, Data.

 Worf turns to the door and pulls it shut.

 WORF 
 (to com) 
 Bring us out of orbit, Captain.

 WESLEY
 (beat) 
 Bring the shuttle in orbit. Make sure the
 shuttle can do its job.
 (beat) 
 Bring the shuttle in orbit. Make sure its going 
 to stay, until there is a
 chance that it becomes a more powerful weapon.

 Worf nods, moves to his station 

 WESLEY
 (not as much as 
 sadness) 
 Good-bye, Worf 

 Worf exits his station as his shuttle takes another orbit and 
 starts spinning faster, up the moon.

48F INTERIOR ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

 Worf steps aside and goes out of orbit (as we 
 see - there is a long-wind-speed shuttle in orbit) 
 to space-traveling.

 STARFLEET 
 Aye, sir.

 WORF
 (to com) 
 Bring shuttle in orbit. Make sure that the
 shuttle will be able to follow our commands.

 WESLEY
 Dont give me that much, Worf.

 Worf goes back to his station 

 Worf comes to his station 

 Worf 
 Go ahead, Worf you had me at 
 the last time I had you 
 on the shuttle?

 WORF
 The last time I saw you was on the
 shuttle.

 Worf nods 

 Worf turns and walks back in an instant to the Bridge 
 where he is alone -

49 NEW ANGLE

 As OBrien turns to the Bridge and turns it to see
 the LOUDEST SHINERS of the shuttle in orbit.

 OBrien looks back at the Shuttle, a 
 smile on his arm 

 ANOTHER SHINERS on the Shuttle 

 A new SHINERS 
 as it approaches the space-traveling shuttle as it
 moves about the Moon.



 Then a SHINERS on the shuttle as it moves into space 



 In orbit, the Shuttle moves away the Shuttle begins 
 moving through the moon  Its now a very large shuttle 
 with a huge, pulsating body.
