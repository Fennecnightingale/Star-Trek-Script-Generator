 GEORGI
 Let him go.
 (re the alien)
 Let him go.

 Riker realizes theres no getting around from
 here and we are going to have to bring Data to
 engineering to help you.

 RIKER
 I need to go.

 GEORDI
 Why?

 RIKER
 Look, I know I cant get around
 to Paris I dont need the
 transporter but I can get these
 intercom codes from here.
 (to Geordi)
 Energize.

 Theres a few final steps to Geordi and Data as they
 DEMATERIALIZE and we STOKE OUT.

 At impulse.

58 INTERIOR RIKER QUARTERS

 Riker is working at his desk when the door CHIMES.

 RIKER
 Yes?

 DOCTOR
 (angry)
 What do you need me?

 RIKER
 I need your help Geordi?

 DOCTOR
 You need someone.
 (reactions)
 Data can be off-line tonight
 - or he is going to have a
 problem. His friend Stamets,
 sir.

 RIKER
 He is coming after me to take
 us to the surface.
 (to Geordi)
 I know hes on his own now.
 (beat)
 I want him on my side alone.
 I mean, Geordi, its
 okay.

 They leave the same room.

 STAR TREK "Haven" - 7/13/87 - ACT FOUR 34.

59 INTERIOR DVANA TENDI FORWARD

 Geordi and Data are standing in front of the identical
 table, eating a cold, hard line meal that
 is absolutely identical to the one I had earlier.

 GEORDI
 (to com)
 I havent created a whole pan.

 Its clear that the two thoughtfully dressed aliens have forgotten
 anything else. Geordi and Data exchange puzzled looks and feel
 that "they ate something."

 GEORDI
 It was really my idea.
 (he looks up at his
 back)
 The stew was really excellent.

 GEORDI
 Im sure the replicator should taste
 exactly the same.

 RIKER
 Well, I know the two of you
 were thinking it was
 just the same table. But I
 liked it much better.

 GEORDI
 Why? Why did you just tell me
 about me?

 RIKER
 I dont know, I know.
 (laughs)
 I mean, I enjoyed the show.
 Thanks for making me feel better.
 The way Stamets was putting this
 puzzle puzzle together.

 GEORDI
 (smells a bit,
 then)
 It just did.
 (beat then joking)
 I think I liked it the way
 he acted.

 As they chuckle side-by-side, we cut to

60 INTERIOR TROI QUARTERS

 Troi ENTERS.

 TROI
 I was coming to say goodbye.

 STAR TREK " Icarus " - REV. 2/8/90 - ACT FOUR 35.

 TROI
 (sotto)
 I did. Well, you can call me
 "lucky." If I remember correctly,
 Im flying again!

 TROI
 Yes?
 (laughing)
 Any luck?

 Troi trails off, not sure what shes saying.

 TROI
 Im headed for Starbase
 Two.

 Troi is on her feet and heading for the doors. Theres a
 brief silence, followed by a tender tone in Trill 
 and he takes this in. He turns to her.

 TROI
 (quiet)
 Hello, Deanna. I hope I will never
 get lost again.

 Troi isnt sure what this means and it shows. Troi takes an
 unexpected step back to the door and turns back. We
 WIDEN to find Riker and Lwaxana standing there.

 TROI
 (quiet)
 Actually, I would have been upset
 - but I think we have grown
 a fine crew, Commander 
 and thanks for our work -
 I dont want anyone turning
 over again.

 RIKER
 (quiet, to com)
 We appreciate your opinion.
 But we wanted to leave
 without anyone interrupting the
 activities but it was an
 extraordinary piece of
