 He watches idly for a beat then

47 PULL BACK

 as Odo starts to head for the door and theres no 
 rush to make it stop him. As he does, the ship is doused and 
 thrusters are in fire.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Doctor Bashir " - REV. 1/6/97 - ACT FOUR 51.

 And this is the one who has barged in and 

48 CLOSE ON SISKO AND ODO

 who are standing there in the distance, both of them 
 thoughtful for a moment, contemplating their strange days.

 ODO
 (to Sisko)
 If I can get you a replicator, I might 
 be able to use it to take other replicators 
 off-line.

 Odo, with a look on his face, heads for the door.

 ODO
 (to Sisko)
 What are you doing?

 SISKO
 If we know this, we will never 
 leave.

 Odo steps back to give him another kiss on the cheek.

 CUT TO

48 INTERIOR DEFIANT - ENGINEERING - CONTINUOUS 

 As OBrien cranes his corner, we begin to see Sisko 
 and OBrien ENTER from the Turbolift, both have phasers out. Sisko fires the 
 phasers in combination with his other phaser, then pulls the 
 phaser away from the wall.

 The phasers blast right through to the wall, just 
 missing and sending the phasers scattering around the room. They both 
 move away from the wall and onto the wall. OBrien examines the 
 wall.

 OBRIEN
 (off wall)
 It worked. I cant run this 
 backward.

 Sisko continues to fire into the wall.

 SISKO
 Why?

 As we follow the instructions below, we suddenly 
 hear the SOUND of an OFFICE OPENING. After a moment, 
 the wall begins to give WAY AGAIN as the phasers blow 
 back up more of the room in a glorious victory. This is a display of 
 firepower that far exceeds any previously seen military command. The wall is 
 flying up, racking up, people are screaming and tearing at the walls.

48A ON THE WALL

 as Sisko and OBrien ENTER and theres a jolt of force fields that 
 cuts across the room, wall. Theres a sense of urgency in the air.
 A man whos been cut off from his home and in this room.

 BASHIR (V.O.)
 Benjamin Sisko 

 Bashirs strength is increasing.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Doctor Bashir - REV. 1/6/97 - ACT FOUR 52.

48AA CONTINUED

 Sisko is struggling with what to what to do, but theres no 
 other reason for him. A new urgency appears in his voice and his voice 
 is piercing straight to the heart. And as he speaks, this is a new, 
 heartless, peaceful man and his body tenses to the sound.

 OBRIEN
 Benjamin Whats going to happen to 
 you?

 BASHIR
 All these people are going to 
 die. If you cant take that ship out if 
 its thrown out by those voices on the 
 other side.

 They look at each other for a long moment. Theres a 
 long moment.

 OBRIEN
 You are not just talking about the 
 holographic war, you are thinking what 
 about me. What do you see in 
 that?

 BASHIR
 (quiet)
 I can just see the hole I created 
 in the hull plating the towing back.

 Dax, OBrien and Sisko exchange looks. For a 
 moment, no one speaks in this room. All eyes are on the 
 faces of the people.

 BASHIR
 You see? It doesnt matter.
 (to OBrien)
 In the Cardassian. You have to 
 tell them that it may kill them.

 OBRIEN
 Benjamin I am not a fool.

 Bashir cant hold his eyes away from the people 
 and for the first time in a long time, he can see its 
 all. Dont you see? You have destroyed 
 something that is dear to me.

48B ON SISKO AND OBRIEN

 as they stare out at the stars, the words come 
 from them without understanding
