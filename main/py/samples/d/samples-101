======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 He
 wants to take you right
 to him. He takes a hand, tries to say it
 out.

 SISKO
 (to Riker)
 (to Dook)
 (a beat)
 I want to ask you, if any of this 
 matters.

 DUKAT
 (with a smile)
 The first
 soldier in the war to die on
 his 
 behalf. There must be some 
 better way.

 DUKAT 
 (beat)
 Maybe I should make it to the
 front.

 RIKER
 (determined)
 No.

 DUKAT 

 SISKO 
 (to Odo)
 (to Cheeta)
 I said, how about him?

 DUKAT
 (to Cheeta)
 I think you are the first woman.

 VICARD
 It seems to me I made that right 
 to him.

 Cheeta is surprised by his 
 reaction.

 Cheeta
 is not surprised much.

 CUT TO

67 INTERIOR SISKO TERACE

 Odo is sitting in the chair, looking bored, his position still the same he was when he was captured.

 ODO
 (to Quark)
 (a sad beat)
 Look what I had 
 to do. 
 (to Quark) 
 I just had to 
 stop myself.

 QUARK 
 (in a quiet voice)
 Its you.

 Quark nods and a beat.

 QUARK
 I agree.

 Quark hesitates a moment, then 
 slowly 
 moves over to one of the windows, turning and taking 
 his position. He turns and leans over the window, looking 
 for Quark, and then drops back and gets a 
 look at Quark, who still holds 
 him.

 QUARK 
 Look at you. This has the same 
 look as the day we met.

 QUARK 
 I think we have both 
 learned a lot.

 Quark, looking over Quark. Quark is leaning backwards, a long
 breath the result of his fatigue.

 QUARK
 (a moment) 
 I have been at a lot of things.

 QUARK 
 (a deep breath)
 A lot. But you did it and you
 always kept your eyes open.

 QUARK 
 (to Quark) 
 You are right in the same 
 position 

 QUARK 
 Im sure thats going to come back to 
 haunt me.

 QUARK 
 Yes. I have thought about 
 it for a long time.

 QUARK 
 Then I think you know whats 
 happened
 this is the way. You 
 might as well 
 tell us how to 
 have our affairs settled down if you dont 
 have any.

 QUARK 
 But I dont understand.

 QUARK 
 If I didnt find you, Id see 
 all this other stuff
 I have been doing.

 QUARK 
 Well I wouldnt have 
 time in space any more
 if I hadnt 
 it.

 QUARK
 And what does that make it ?

 QUARK 
 Theres something I wanted to tell you about.

 QUARK 
 Why, the mission to find me, not get me 
 the death you want.

 Quark is stunned silence. He cant imagine Quark not feeling quite so 
 torn his feelings are so raw.

 QUARK
 (to Quark) 
 I have talked about it, the whole thing. 
 (hiches it)
 That is all I can do.
 And I will discuss it with Quark one last time.

 QUARK 
 If you dont 
 leave I will kill Quark 
 myself!

 QUARK 
 I will kill Quark!

 QUARK 
 (defensive) 
 Quark dont kill Quark 

 QUARK 
 If Quark doesnt leave tomorrow, Quark
 will kill Quark, then Quark
 will kill Quark. Quark wont stop him. Quark will continue 
 killing Quark, until Quark
 finally stops.

 QUARK 
 (to Quark)
 I wouldnt have wanted 
 to do it but Quark got my 
 life in the first three times he got Quark, the first
 time he found him, 
 Quark attacked Quark.

 QUARK 
 (not surprised)
 I guess we can agree.

 QUARK (O.K.) 
 I have killed Quarks wife, Quark.

 QUARK 
 If you want me
