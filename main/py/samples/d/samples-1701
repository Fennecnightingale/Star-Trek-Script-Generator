 to see a Starfleet soldier, dressed in 
 the same robes as a Klingon.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Way You
 Look Tonight, at least its wearing Klingon
 uniform.

 It is clear by the beginning that this is a Klingons
 uniform, and Worf is no match for it. Worf has
 taken an enormous effort to get the look of the man he
 is dying out of a man-like,
 but finally Worf gives him only a fraction of the man.

 Worf looks to Worf with equal solemnity. Picard glances at Worf,
 and Worf realizes Worf is losing.

 WORF
 The light is not going to lighten my
 face.

 One man at a time in history, is one man
 worth saving.

 WORF
 I hope one day of the light will be
 Daxs face and not mine.
 (beat)
 A little in the future the darkness
 of space will set up the foundation
 of my life upon.

 Worf has won.
 The moment of triumph hangs in the air as they savors
 each other for a great victory and a triumph.
 And we have the feeling that this is just as a man-
like man as it is. They exchange
 glances between them and in time Worf looks to a small,
 man-like, young man whom he knows, looks on the
 brink of greatness.

 Worf holds out his hand to Worf.

47A WORF

 lowers his hand and Worf looks to them, in
 the manner of victory on the young man.
 Worf pulls his gun and Worfs features begin to
 take shape on the screen of his life. Worf is
 suddenly an ancient man, in his very
 own era.
