 I, the Doctor? He was not programmed out to do it.

 DATA
 (from console)
 It is a paradox. It
 cannot be transcended.
 (trouble)
 I cannot provide an answer -

 PICARD
 (calmly)
 You will give it now. I will
 not allow the Klingons to obtain
 the telekinetic services from the Vulcan
 science stations.

 DATA
 The Captain is preparing a
 telekinetic services for us.
 You will begin receiving
 telekinetic data at once.

 PICARD
 It is only going to make a difference.

 DATA
 The Klingons will use their own
 telekinetic abilities to a considerable
 degree. They have yet to gain
 enough control of this system.
 We are still trying to establish
 that.
 (indicating Picard)
 Hes prepared to perform this.

 Data and Picard stare at each other silently.

45 CLOSE ON PICARD

 He takes a moment, then he prepares himself to
 do whatever it takes to protect the system. The
 telekinetic services begin to gradually
 deactivate. Picard rises from the throne

 PICARD
 (continuing)
 I want the telekinetic
 systems back on-line but you will
 need more power to counteract
 those ships. I dont want them to
 be able to be moved off-balance.
 Please, we need a way to get an
 emergency system -
