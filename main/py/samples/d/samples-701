RI.
 (beat)
 You are a brave man and I
 commend you.
 (beat)
 But I have a feeling there are
 more things we can do.

 STAR TREK "Birthright, Pt. III" - REV. 01/06/94 - ACT TWO 61.

60 CONTINUED

 NOG
 You are not just a man.
 (beat)
 You have done everything.

 NOG
 You cant do this.

 PICARD
 You are the Commander.

 NOG
 You have the permission to do it. Id just
 like to try to let him do it.

 PICARD
 I havent had permission.

 NOG
 Theres something wrong with asking another
 man to do this.
 (beat)
 Tell me.

 And with that, Nog EXITS.

 NOG
 (continuing)
 You want me all to get
 used to being a computer?

 NOG
 I dont want anything.

 PICARD
 And when we get out of here to
 Rhea?

 NOG
 Hes right here.

 Rhea considers a beat.

 Rhea
 What happened?


 STAR TREK "Birthright, Pt. III" - REV. 01/05/94 - ACT II 62.

61 INTERIOR CAPTAIN OFFICE

 Riker is staring into the distance, as Picard
 comes up behind him.

 PICARD
 Computer, report.

 COMPUTER VOICE
 The transmission was intercepted.

 PICARD
 Well, Commander, I dont want to hear another
 word about the problem here.

 INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 Picard looks back to the corridor, where Picard and Data ENTER.

 PICARD
 Data, report.

 DATA
 Not an interesting idea, Captain. The
 problem is very complex.
 It contains large subspace energy,
 which may be a large drain of subspace energy.

 Picard looks around, and he has become more concerned.

 PICARD
 (disappointed)
 The next thing you would think to do would be
 try to take out the plasma flow.

 Data agrees with Picard.

 DATA
 Perhaps that would be ideal.

 PICARD
 You could, Data, change the subspace energy matrix
 and take out all power on this transmission.

 He moves quickly by Picard and removes his communicator.

 PICARD
 Acknowledged.

 Picard and Data EXIT. Off Worfs face as this
 continues to happen to his father.

 CUT TO

 FADE OUT.

62 INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 Picard looks at his brother, who is staring at his communicator.

 PICARD
 (unconvinced)
 This is the Captain.

 PICARD
 Well, Lieutenant.

 As they stand there.

 PICARD
 We are moving.

 Picard hesitates for a moment, a quiet beat.

 PICARD
 Can I see, Mister Data.

 They both go for a beat.

 COMPUTER VOICE
 What are you looking for?

 PICARD
 He might need assistance.

 A beat, Captain.

 COMPUTER VOICE
 The situation is very
 important.

 PICARD
 Is it?

 COMPUTER VOICE
 Very.

 NOG
 The problem is, Lieutenant.

 PICARD
 I don’���������t understand.

 NOG
 Yes.

 Picard contemplates for a moment.

 PICARD
 Lieutenant.

 DATA
 What can I say?

 PICARD
 Data, you are in charge here
 now.

 INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 Picard watches with a moment as Data and Rana ENTER.

 Rana
 How are you, sir?

 DATA
 (interrupting)
 I am in charge.

 They share a moment.

 RANA
 Then.

 As they EXIT the area, Picard looks up into
 the corridor.

 INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 Picard watches Rara leaving with Picard waiting.

 PICARD (contd)
 My presence would be preferable
 if you were given a look.

 INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 Picard watches as Rana, Picard and Data watch as
 Rana returns, but the situation is very important
 now.

 A beat is missing.

 INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 And Picard is disturbed. They are all
 watching as Rana and Picard ENTER.

 Picard watches to see whether they will ever ever see
 this kind
