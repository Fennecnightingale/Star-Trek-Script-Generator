======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 planet, Im in a state of mind.
 (pause)
 You are not like the others, are you?

 BASHIR
 Like the others. Thats all.
 (beat)
 And on the bright side, we got a good job
 just off the city. How many
 Cardassian citizens had you killed?

 KIRA
 Only one. As a matter of fact, I
 killed the other one.

 BASHIR
 Thats a fact.

 KIRA
 (a whisper)
 No, its not.
 (quiet whisper)
 Listen to me Nerys if you will 
 make up with me 

 Garak stiffens at hearing this.

 BASHIR
 I have got a perfect sense of my 
 brother. I always looked at him 
 with my eyes down the distance.

 KIRA
 I was trying to get to him one 
 day the other was watching them 
 and I saw myself doing it. But 
 I didnt. I was hoping to get 
 back home. I couldnt stand 
 watching him anymore.
 (beat, quiet)
 I just came back from the city and saw him 
 start the game. I saw him start the game, 
 I saw him fall as he told the Maquis he was 
 bluffing, but he did. I knew
 that if I were out there, he had 
 a chance to make a grand 
 entrance. I didnt know it, 
 so I took a risk. I didnt do it. I 
 knew that the Cardassians would follow 
 him, so I killed him. I went for his 
 throat.
 (beat)
 I could have killed him. But I didnt. We 
 did.

 Garak takes a breath, tries to swallow hard.

 KIRA
 A hundred and ninety-nine point years is 
 the one I was supposed to be 
 buying 

 BASHIR
 You are gonna have to be a hero 
 to get something done.
 (beat)
 You are gonna have to build a new life 
 out in the real world instead of 
 the game 

 KIRA
 Thats pretty complex for Sisko.

 SISKO
 Im proud of you, Garak.

 GARAK
 I understand he sounds desperate 
 for you to come back. Im sure 
 he does have a lot of work to 
 do here among these people.

 A beat.

 SISKO
 So does Arissa, Quark or Rom.

 A beat.

 ROM
 Even Quark. Just another 
 complicated complication for you.

 Quark has been expecting Rom to say something and he 
 surprises, his expression hardens.

 QUARK
 Rom, if you are here because of 
 a vendetta 

 ROM
 This has no way to deal with 
 Bajor.

 Quark is surprised.

 QUARK
 Rom you said yourselves.
 (a beat)
 You said yourself things less than the 
 other Cardassian.

 ROM
 Did I. You dont. And thats 
 why I can count on you.

 Rom turns down a new table, almost as though finding out 
 a new and exciting new life in his past.

 ROM
 Lets sit down to enjoy a new life, Garak.

 Garak is surprised by Odos approach.

 QUARK
 So what are you going to do now? 
 That you are going to go back to 
 Ferenginar? Because thats 
 where I was meant to be.

 ROM
 I know you are all crazy. But I know 
 I love the Federation. I know 
 they wouldnt care for me if I 
 was them puppet.

 QUARK
 Rom is a Ferenginaran. That 
 was something I know.
 (a beat)
 All this time, like a puppet

 Rom is so intent, so eager for Quark to give in. This is the 
 one thing no
