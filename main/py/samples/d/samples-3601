58 CLOSE ON SISKO

 As he looks out at the carnage.

 CUT TO

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Musell - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FOUR 36.

59 INTERIOR RIO GRANDE - AIRLOCK

 The airlock OPENS and close. Just as before, Sisko and
 Dax ENTER to find Sisko and Dax standing there, flanked by the
 others.

 SISKO 
 Commander. I believe you made some
 of the necessary repairs in the
 air system.

 DAX
 And you were willing to risk getting 
 the systems back on-line?

 SISKO 
 I didnt want that.

 DAX
 (not buying it) 
 Commander, look at this.

 SISKO
 (not buying it) 
 Look at the things I said to myself 
 out there - the things I meant to do.
 Thats an honest mistake. Let him
 know that he wasnt going to blame
 himself.

 DAX
 Maybe all the blame was on my
 mother. But it wasnt going 
 to happen. All the time, we talked
 about it, and now Im 
 afraid we will be stuck with 
 the same problem -
 (sighs) 
 But I dont think I can change 
 it.

 Sisko and Dax both look at each other, and they both know it.

 DAX 
 I just dont understand. Why not
 give me a ship? It sounds 
 like we are not living in his 
 world anymore.

 SISKO 
 Its so easy to believe. Theories 
 say you always have wings and always 
 let the cat wait for me. So 
 let me just show them.

 Sisko looks at Dax for once, but her face softening a bit.

 DAX
 (gently) 
 Dont let them. I just dont 
 know - and I can barely remember a part of me 
 anyway.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Musell - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FOUR 36A.

59 CONTINUED

 And with that, she turns to Sisko, who smiles with gratitude.
 As Sisko turns back to the airlock door, he looks at it.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Musell - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FOUR 37.

59 CONTINUED (2)

 And on that image, we 

 FADE OUT.

 END OF ACT FOUR 

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Musell - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FIVE 38.
 ACT FIVE 

 FADE IN

60 INTERIOR RIO GRANDE - AIRLOCK

 Sisko and Dax ENTER to find Sisko waiting for them.

 DAX
 We will just go back and check if you 
 can find anything.
 (beat) 
 That will have to hold another 
 close.
 (beat) 
 But we should have a cover-up 
 solution. Something simple to implement.

 Just then, OBrien ENTERS. She motions to get to the 
 airlock door.

 OBRIEN
 Theres no way we can tell.

 DAX
 How do you plan on going back?

 OBRIEN
 We will leave the airlock. We will find 
 out whats going on.

 DAX 
 The only logical solution is to get 
 him out of there - and then we can 
 figure out whats going to be 
 going on.

 SISKO
 (re their parting glance) 
 You dont give yourself choice, dont 
 you?

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Musell - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FIVE 39.


60 CONTINUED

 OBRIEN 
 I know where to look.

 Off their reactions 

61 INTERIOR SICKBAY

 Bashir is finishing up some last minute. After a moment, he looks up, 
 smiling. Hes not looking forward to getting back, but hes 
 sure the future holds up better than he had ever imagined.

 BASHIR
 Well, I was looking forward to
 going back, I suppose. But the 
 Challenger will be waiting for me.

 OBrien ENTERS the room, and is not at all what one might expect of Qu.
 He quietly introduces himself to her.

 OBRIEN
 Excuse me if I interrupt.

 QU
 Sorry, Im afraid you are still 
 under house arrest.

 OBRIEN
 You know, I have heard things 
 about that one day.

 QU
 What?
