point, she smiles and turns to the computer station Sisko moves next to her. In the
 background, Keiko and Jake walk up, they are in the bar and serve
 customers.

 QUARK
 Very well, what do we do now?

 JOSEPH
 Quite the opposite, but you see,
 no matter how far they travel, a chance
 will comes to encounter a worthy adversary in
 their own way. So you are going to
 be my nemesis.

 Quark walks off before OBrien can respond. In the
 background, OBrien hears the comm voice calling him to Ops.

 RACAD
 OBrien!

 OBRIEN
 Look, I need you to do a lot better than
 he does. Can you get along?

 RACAD
 You have never bothered me before in
 this manner.

 OBRIEN
 Im not as easy on myself as I sounded.

 SISKO
 Its ok all right. You were right 
 its not wrong.

 OBRIEN
 No, it isnt 

 Quark and Jake walk out together  Jake tries to find
 them with his large cackling, but is held back as well
 as if hed rather run into a dog 

 QUARK
 Wait and see how the big
 problems look. It might
 be in here.

 to see the door to the Infirmary OPEN to reveal
 Brunt, Morn and an N.D. Bajoran male
 Officer, weighing her case, graciously.

 BRUNT
 What do you want?

 QUARK
 (re PADD)
 I need to speak with Lieutenant
 Uhura. Please help
 me find my mother.

 BRUNT
 Shes still on board the Nacoli.

 QUARK
 I could think of it. I dont
 want my mother in front of an admiral
 looking at me like a bull.

 BRUNT
 You think this is a big
 step?

 QUARK
 I dont know. You
 do.

 BRUNT
 I didnt mean this as a comment.

 QUARK
 (defending himself)
 What you just did was brilliant.
 But I want more than that.
 I want my business with Erika
 finished.

 BRUNT
 You would?

 QUARK
 (definitly)
 Is it too late for that.

82 NEW ANGLE

 as all eyes turn to see Brunt turning to face Quark and
 as he speaks, he looks at Quark with a calm, kind 
 and compassionate inflection as if everything thats
 been happening to his soul is reawakened and
 the two of them look at each other, not even a
 hostile expression on his part 

 BRUNT
 It was a wise choice.
 (a beat)
 Which is the one thing I still
 think.
 (a beat)
 I want the truth.

 QUARK
 What does it need to be told?

 BRUNT
 Nothing. My personal
 history indicates I lied to you at
 the very earliest time you
 accused me of being a
 criminal, Admiral.

 QUARK
 You are lying.
 (definitely)
 A lot of people, maybe.

 BRUNT (Contd)
 But if I had, you know she
 is NOT what you made up of,
 Admiral. She is a woman I have
 known I regret that choice.

 Rom gets up and moves closer to Quark.

 ROM
 You do remember the day I told
 you to take a walk on the beach?

 QUARK
 Just curious, I guess.

 Dax reacts to something off-screen as Quark
 speaks.

 QUARK
 When did I remember the day?

 DAX
 A few days ago, a Starfleet
 officer came in to wash
 my bathing suit. No idea
 what it ended.

 QUARK
 (re PADD)
 At the time the door to my quarters
 OPENS and Kornan
 ENTERS this room. By the
 time I had been gone, hed
 already been gone. When I had
 the chance to talk with Brunt
 some other day, he might have been
 looking for you.

 Quark shakes his head as if its too painful.

 QUARK
 No Im no-

 DAX
 Dont tell me about Brunt - what
 will he do?

 QUARK
 I dont know. No one will stop me
 when
