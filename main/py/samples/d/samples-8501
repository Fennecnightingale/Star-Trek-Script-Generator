39 EXTERIOR SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND BARYON BEAM (OPTICAL)

 Looking relieved 

 DATA
 (continuing)
 What have you looking forward 
 to?

 HANNAH
 About your target?

 DATA
 Bajoran. A member of your past 
 who is destined for it to be -
 the Bajoran.

 HANNAH

 DATA
 No, that is true.

 HANNAH
 Why did you change your mind?

 DATA
 It was necessary to change me.

 But it was a necessary step and the result of that 
 act is a new one 

 HANNAH
 I dont understand.

 DATA
 (continuing)
 You need more light than this 
 to support your memories. I 
 found that to be difficult 

 DATA
 Which is why I am here 

 HANNAH
 Is that what you want?

 DATA
 It would be very difficult for the
 android to achieve an objective
 which requires elimination of the
 genetic material 

 PICARD
 What would you call this? Your
 goal? To perpetuate your
 own creation?

 Data, who is completely incapable of
 answering - begins instead to simply
 destroy it 

 HANNAH
 "Infinite" is meaningless! You are
 destroying one that has
 possessed memories of valuable
 importance!

 Data approaches, speaks up 

 DATA
 There is a question that might
 amuse you.

 watch while the android builds?
 All the things she values. One building
. On the building move. She moves off 

 DATA
 What are you doing?

 HANNAH
 Its necessary for the survival
 operation.

 DATA
 Then you are planning to
 disobey my orders and
 build on the remains of your
 predecessor.

 HANNAH
 No sir. That is not my
 intention.

 Data is gratified to know that shes serious.
