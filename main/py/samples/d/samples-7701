 and before it can completely collapse, a small metal
 pulsing drives the ship toward us.

 GEORDI
 It better go right ahead and
 check the power transfer
 patterns before you engage
 warp engines.

 RIKER COM VOICE
 Understood.

 On the viewscreen, our small ship swoops
 directly toward us.

 GEORDI
 We have got less than five seconds
 before life-support fails.
 (to Worf)
 Prepare to engage warp engines.

 Worf works the console.

 WORF
 The warp engines are offline.

 GEORDI
 (to his crew)
 Geordi to engineering.

 The ship shakes.

 GEORDI

 La Forge here.

 Geordi hits his console - and the ship shakes
 again and Worf rushes over.

 La Forge 

 Geordi sits back down, and they both watch for a beat.

73 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE RIZerently Aster (OPTICAL)

 The ship is slowly turning on a course toward the asteroid
 asteroid, a small fragment of the ship still sticking toward it.

 Geordi looks up.

 GEORDI
 Sir, small energy particles are
 coming from the aft asteroids.

 Geordi stares at his instruments.

 GEORDI
 (beat)
 They are drawing their energy from the
 asteroid. Its being reflected by the
 fragments of the ship.

 He looks to Worf.

 GEORDI
 Thats enough for the ships
 shields.

 WORF
 It will not be enough for the Enterprise.

 GEORDI
 (beat)
 I cant take life-forms on
 board - not the way they want.

 Picard studies his console.

 PICARD
 Mister Data, analyse the
 particle density in the shields.

 DATA
 The fragments of the ship seem to
 possess some kind of energy
 propulsion. Life-forms are
 generating unusually high, high
 radiation levels on their
 shields.

 GEORDI
 Its the reverse, Captain -
 Im just telling the ship to come back for
 a run.

 PICARD
 Understood.

 KAREEN
 (to Worf)
 Prepare to fire on the Enterprise.

 WORF
 Aye, Captain.

 Geordi and the bridge crew fire. Kareens
 tactical console is jolted to its knees by enemy fire 
 Kareen rushes to his console - she begins to work the
 console. Suddenly the ship goes to RED ALIEN and the Fire
 starts.

 Seska rushes to her console.

 SESKA
 The shields are at full power now.
 (to Worf)
 Lower shields.

 WORF
 (working)
 Shields down to sixty-five percent.

 KAREEN
 Geordi, look at this. The
 shields are collapsing because of what
 the ship has
 done to the hull. The ship is giving out
 massive FIRE. The entire bridge has been
 ROCKED (and a few consoles SWF) 

 WORF
 Shielding systems are at thirty-two
 percent. Shields are holding.

 KAEEMO
 (to com)
 Bridge, emergency beam-down here!

 A bright light shows the Bridge crew - Riker and Data
 at their stations as they run to the console.

 RIKER
 Go to visual-view, Lieutenant Yar.

 A short silence.

 WORF
 We have lost the shields.

 Riker reacts as he realizes that everyone is on the
 verge -

 SESKA
 Geordi, lets go!

 Geordi and the rest of the Bridge crew EXIT the
 console, leaving the Bridge and the entire Bridge in
 position.
