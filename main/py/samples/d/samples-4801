41 INTERIOR ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING

 (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY SCENE 33C)

 Wesley in the Engineering section of the ship 
 looks like hes just entering some sort of subspace 
 channel to the com system.

 WESLEY
 (to com)
 Geordi. Whats going on here?

 INTERCUT

42 WIDER

 Worf and Tasha walking quickly along. Worf is on the
 upper level, while Tasha has her case. The boys are
 clearly in a different corridor, with their hands on
 various computer controls.

 WESLEY
 (frustrated)
 Whats going on?

 TASHA
 I dont know. I just dont
 feel. Its like if I dont know
 whats going on, I dont know
 what might have some kind of help 

 Wesley and Tasha continue walking, their hands
 trembling.

43 WIDE ANGLE - AS YOU GUARD

 Suddenly, in the midst of the players, we see Roms
 ship come tearing around the Enterprise. Roms ship is large,
 well-armed, but just barely, so he might touch it 
 hard. The boys scramble away, and Worf, Tasha and
 Worf move to help Wesley. Roms ship is in a
 different corridor, and has different equipment. His
 ship is in a laboratory. It has different
 lighting, and different electronics.

44 WIDE ANGLE - WESLEY AND TASHA

 Worf and Tasha watch Wesley and Toran come running 
 from Roms ship.

 WESLEY
 (to Toran)
 I guess we have them, Data.

 TASHA
 We have them, Data.

 But before Tasha can get a good idea whats
 going on, Roms sudden appearance in
 Engineering, and a few other players look on with
 varying degrees of relief.

 RIKER COM VOICE
 General quarters.

 STAR TREK "Lonely Among Us" - 7/07/93 - ACT FOUR 49.

44 CONTINUED

 WORF
 Please come, Crusher. Its
 urgent.

 WESLEY
 (to Data)
 Data, the children should get
 away from there, or there will be
 force fields and other restraints.

 The boys freeze with emotion as Data looks
 back at them.

 DATA
 As I am Commander Thomas Halloway
 of the United Federation of Planets, I
 find that I am unable to ignore his
 recommendations.

 RIKER
 (to Riker)
 He could be here. We dont know
 that.

 Riker reacts, and moves to the bridge.

 RIKER COM VOICE
 Data? Data, report to
 Engineering, and we will await your
 signal when I have command of
 the Enterprise.

 RIKER (Contd)
 (then pointing a phaser at
 them)
 Lock, Lieutenant 
 (points it at Wesley)
 Stay in mind, Data. I hate
 for you to have to deal with
 something that you dont
 understand.

 Data, Wesley, and the boys look at Data with a
 puzzled look. Data is standing before a wall of flame, and
 the fire is burning, and the boys stare at it with fear.
 Off this disturbing sight, we go to -

45 INTERIOR ENGINEERING (FORMERLY SCENE 33D)

 where the boys are sitting on a few different
 controls. Data turns to them. The boys are
 confused, unsure what they have done. They look as though
 hes completely blank-faced. Data is trying to put things
 together as he goes to his console, his voice
 crackling.

 DATA
 (to com)
 Data to Engineering. Im here.
 I am here. I am here.

 Data steps back.

 DATA
 (to com)
 Data to Engineering. Im here,
 too. I understand nothing.

 Data then turns to Wesley, who seems to be at
 a loss. On the image of them, we SEE that the burn has
 been extinguished.

 RIKER COM VOICE
 Engineering to Riker.
 (no response)
 Data, I have the same thing. We have exactly
 left one of our own vessels. We have no
 intention of leaving it.

 DATA
 We will take it into our ships
 immediately.

 RIKER COM VOICE
 Acknowledged.

 Data nods. Wesley and the ship shakes.

 WESLEY
 (off console)
 The burn on our shuttle was
 extinguished when we discovered the
 truth.
