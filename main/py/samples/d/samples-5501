 there and start the fight

 KIRA
 Theres nothing wrong here for you to 
 worry about now 

 SISKO
 I dont think you are following me yet, you 
 dont have much control 

 KIRA
 Just trust in me and dont let the 
 F.C. go off on your own you wont 
 regret it 

 SISKO
 Thats all I need to say 

 Now Kiros eyes widen 

 KIRA
 Now where?

 SISKO
 It doesnt matter what you have 
 thought about you there are options 
 to do it from now on your own terms 

 Kira realizes Sisko is telling her the truth 


 DEEP SPACE NINE "Extreme Measures" - REV. 03/31/99 - ACT FIVE 62.

 And Kira knows it and cant help but be a little 
 moved by it.

 Worf (with gileges) is being chased and nearly falls, an old

 We see a beat on Worf as he tries not to get up but 
 the fight quickly begins to kick in

 to see the three JemHadar soldiers in front

 the impact of the blows

 As the JemHadar soldiers head for the air a short distance behind 
 Worf and Brunt, who have joined Worf through the lift and 
 push. Worf reacts to the approaching troops of 
 the bridge 

 WORF 
 How do they open the hatches?

 Brunt works the helm console and reacts with surprise when 
 several Romulan soldiers appear from the Promenade 
 and across Quarks table in the b.g.

93 CONTINUED

 BRUNT 
 You are not in a position to 
 fire at my own people 

 SISKO
 Theres no way to be certain.

 BRUNT 
 Then I suggest you start the 
 attack 

 After a beat 

 KIRA 
 (to Quark) 
 No, but when you make the 
 attack, you are going to 
 expect us to retreat and 
 cover us.

 Quark starts to move away and to Worf pauses and 
 contemplates what these people would do to 
 him 

 DAX 
 What about you, Quark? There 
 were a few hundred of them in the 
 Promenade who were the 
 only JemHadar I was able to 
 see was this you and this 
 we didnt want to make it 
 through this without 
 help.

 A beat and Worf again looks forward to what they will 
 do and finally admits it with a simple but firm 
 determination 

 WORF 
 I think they are just like you 

 But for this moment we see that the promise of this 
 was just not true, Worf realizes what he must 
 do - He picks up his rifle, and 
 shoves a couple of Romulan soldiers, all heading for 
 Sisko - but theres still time to be done 
 and he grabs it with a hand and
