 I have got three days left.

 QUARK
 (thinking his job is
 up to the best)
 How about two?

 ZEK
 (a beat)
 The higher the better.

 QUARK
 If you think about this, when the
 two of you get this through with.

 ZEK
 I dont suppose you mind cutting your
 fingers if Im being so tired?

 QUARK
 Im not hungry.

 They share a smile then Zek walks away.

38 INTERIOR HOLDING CELL

 Bashir and OBrien are looking at each other again
 wondering as he watches over his shoulder, when suddenly he
 turns and grabs him by the arm, grabs him and
 pulls him toward the end of the cell.

 BASHIR
 Hey, hey. I told you 

 They react. Bashir, OBrien and Quark look at each other again, as
 Bashir, OBrien, Quark and Leeta stand.

 OBRIEN
 You know what you got, Julian?

 BASHIR
 The last thing I have tried to do
 was convince the JemHadar to stop
 attacking us.

 OBRIEN
 And now they have us.

 BASHIR
 Well, in the meantime, I got some
 work to do.

 OBRIEN
 So what do you think?

 BASHIR
 Its the JemHadar. They are
 going to be here.
 (a beat)
 We will have to go through them
 when the JemHadar does.

 KIRA
 I will decide when we are ready.

 BASHIR
 You cant make a good choice
 at this point. The JemHadar
 lives more than just a few
 months. We will have to be on guard
 at all, because they wont
 let us escape even though we
 dont want to.

 OBRIEN
 You dont think so.

 BASHIR
 Yes, I think you do.
 (a beat)
 Im not sure its my gut feeling
 right now. But I just
 tell myself what the 
 JemHadar do. They kidnap people in
 a few hours, kill them. They
 then kill the rest of their
 prisoners. Then they drive
 the rest of their
 JemHadar out of their military
 life support and then they run
 on, their next target is the
 USS JemHadar. I
 think we have got to work on a new supply
 line of nanoprobes as soon as
 as the warheads are loaded.

38 CONTINUED

 OBRIEN
 Then we go looking
 through one another all the rest
 of the JemHadar ships.
 (off his look)
 We will be ready for them at
 the time.

 BASHIR
 How do you know you wont attack
 anyway?

 OBRIEN
 Its obvious he is.

 BASHIR
 Of course.

 Bashir starts to turn back, then OBrien gets to his feet and
 starts heading for the forward door. OFF

 CUT TO

39 INTERIOR CARGO BAY

 Bashir is with OBrien and Quark watching as his
 back door opens for the new cargo. OBrien is carrying the
 bulkhead, as is Bashir, with

 OBRIEN
 We have cleared the forward door.

 OBRIEN
 (to Bashir)
 Ready to start loading.

 Bashir is already thinking as much about the
 JemHadar as he does. OBrien is having some
 fun at this, although hes a little reluctant to
 acknowledge the whole gesture.

 OBRIEN
 Well, we have got a heavy cargo to worry
 about, is that what?

 BASHIR
 When is your shipment due?

 OBRIEN
 One hundred tomorrow afternoon.

 BASHIR
 Then go on.

 OBrien starts toward the aft cargo door at his desk, as
 Bashir reacts in surprise he gets the feeling he
 wont like this.

 BASHIR
 Uh, how could I forget to have
 this in my mind?

 OBRIEN
 I dont need or as much fun
 as you can.

 BASHIR
 Nice. You should relax a few
 and let us open the bulkheads.

 OBRIEN
 All right.

 BASHIR
 (bristling)
 Open them.

 OBRIEN
 Thank you.
 (a beat)
 We have got a lot of cargo to beam aboard
 right now.

 BASHIR
 We are not leaving without the
 intention
