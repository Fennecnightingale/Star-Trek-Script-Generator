 PULASKI

 PULASKI

 you.

 OBRIAN
 What is that?

 OBRIENANTOICARDAGEALADULUM. She
 is sitting there, her voice a raucous
 sputus rhythm.

 OBRIEN
 You have got it?

 N.D. OBriens glance her is
 so rhythm of moving
 motions, so intense that in
 moment I stopped, I almost
 killed her. The
 rhythm becomes so irregular. At
 the wrong frequency it makes the song
 impossible to
 play.

 OBRIEN
 (temper still)
 You played the last song.

 She moves about the room, a beat 

 OBRIEN
 (moving toward
 the door of her cell)

 OBRIEN

 understood)

 and picking up an
 instrument)
 I used an open D-D tunic.

 N.D. OBRIEN
 (tied by Riker)
 And you.

 N.D. OBRIEN (Contd)
 Go ahead.

 OBRIEN
 You must be here.

 They react to the instruments.

 OBRIEN
 (trying to be calm)
 I can try.

 OBRIEN
 (firing on instrument

 in her voice)
 I know, Im not supposed
 to let you run.

 OBRIEN
 (to OBrien)
 This is wrong.

 OBRIEN
 (suddenly intense)
 You dont have to do it.

 OBRIEN
 No we are not going to play the
 song.

 OBRIEN
 I have a friend who does.

 OBRIEN
 (trying to talk)
 Its not the time.

 OBRIEN
 We are not going to make friends.

 OBRIEN
 (realigning up
 to her own pace)
 Its going to hurt.

 OBRIEN
 It takes us a minute.
 (to Nog)
 If we cant get the music,
 we will end up playing
 the music of
 "A Simple " - REV. 2/14/98 - ACT THREE 26.

 listening to it.

 N.D. OBRIEN
 What about the others?

 OBRIEN

 That will do me.

 N.D. OBRIEN
 (to
 OBrien)
 Give him a good song in
 case he cant think it all
 over. The ones we want all
 the music for was

 that school.

 OBriens not so lucky, and he doesnt even feel the
 vibrations.

 OBRIEN
 Try your hand, sir.

 OBRIEN
 But you know its a lot of good.

 OBriens trying hard enough to get the music -

 OBRIEN
 The music doesnt feel all right
 for you. I dont know why
 theres something so
 long after I was so
 much better than the
 music from 

 RIKER
