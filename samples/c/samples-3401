======== SAMPLE 1 ========
..
CHAKOTAY We have a perimeter alert. All hands, battle stations.
CHAKOTAY On my way.
JANEWAY Janeway pi one one one.

(Jaffens Quarters)

YERID Acknowledged.
YERID I have accepted the challenge.
YERID What is it.
YERID I will show you. The other is more powerful than the third, and the other less powerful. They will eventually yield to
YERID Its not the same.
YERID I have been waiting in the Federation for this. You have always believed
it.
YERID But you have deceived yourself. The system cannot be defeated. We have prepared
an escape route.
YERID We can leave.
YERID Then I will show you the way.

(Cargo Bay Two - Corridor)

YERID Go. The other is to take the system.
YERID We have been prepared for this. You will not be harmed. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> PART THREE
YERID (Contd)
YERID The other cannot. It is the same.
YERID We have tried to convince you that the system is not the place for us. Please
ignore them. Go home when you return.
YERID No. I have already prepared a way to leave!
YERID Yes, I have.
YERID If you do not comply with our order, this duel will become
more intense than the last.
YERID You have the last word. Theres a final final solution to this,
YERID. Now.
ADMIRAL You may regret that. This is the final solution to this, and its time for you to accept the
convenence of the Elite.
YERID Yes, please. Dont trouble.
ADMIRAL Youd be surprised what a difference this will make.
YERID (contd) Not if it saves lives.
YERID (contd) Nothing in the galaxy would make that same.
ADMIRAL Yes.
YERID (contd) Nothing.
YERID You have been testing your ability, and the results are the same.
ADMIRAL This is a waste of time.
YERID Then I would have told you, you are not the only One. Other members of your
crew will join you. You will win. If you win I will see less of your activity. I may
offer support in the event that an alien presence remains the Alpha quadrant.
ADMIRAL Other members of your crew are your allies. They will attack us from the surface. They will find us.
YERID I are preparing our fleet for battle.
ADMIRAL Your troops can deploy themselves by means of warp seven. However, I doubt
your fleet can stand by for the battle to be won from the surface.
YERID I cant believe you say that.
ADMIRAL There are a few things going on that wont be
easier. Captain Janeway is my guarantee that these alliances will last
through their rear. If she wins the battle, I will be forced to
assimilate her. That means if we are going to win.
YERID If you win I will give you my fleet.
ADMIRAL Your crew? I guess you could call them allies.
YERID You are wrong. They dont know what alliance means here.
ADMIRAL They dont know our capabilities and you know
I will win my fleet. The truth is that the alliances are not
necessarily permanent. The best outcome is what happened.
YERID Which means if we have an ally we may be able to turn out

(Corridor)

YERID I havent slept myself in.
ADMIRAL You are awake. Are you able to sleep?
YERID I have tried every imaginable relaxation imaginable way. But I am trying to
compensate for your weakness. You could say that if you could. Just give me another
chance.
ADMIRAL Im still helping you through your head.
YERID You have only to worry about one thing, Seven. My trust in you. Tell
us I want to be patient. I will help you.
ADMIRAL You do well. Give her another chance.
YERID Its not too late. I know what your enemy does on the
surface. It is time. Go.
ADMIRAL Give him time. Hes not what he thinks to be happening.
YERID I think I have been avoiding you lately. If one of your men gets into
your way, I will put them
