======== SAMPLE 1 ========


 Odo stands up, pacing like someone lost a step.

 Odo looks around for a place to hide the fact that hes out of sight
 to the others.

 ODO
 I thought the boy would get you out of the
 picture.
 (to Troi)
 I assume you took him,
 as soon after he left.
 (to Troi)
 I want you to help him now.

 TROI
 Im not doing anything to hurt
 his life. If you want
 him to suffer for the rest of his
 life, I feel a
 little obligated to allow
 him to see this helpless boy,
 as though to absolve him.

 ODO
 What, lady, is this some part
 of the settlement?

 TROI
 I couldnt tell. As soon as they
 leave, he will be able to turn his
 into a member of any community
 and settle in.

 ODO
 I think hes already had a
 chance to atone for atrocities
 committed by the Khitomer massacre.

 Riker and OBrien look at him.

 RIKER
 (to Troi)
 How are we going to help him?

 TROI
 As through the crowd, he will tell
 them what happened and how to go
 where he needs to go, and he will join
 them.

 ODO
 His eyes wont leave hers,
 Counselor.

 RIKER
 It wont until we find
 where he wants to go.
 (to Troi)
 Counselor, what exactly is it
 about the Khan who doesnt want
 to see him?
 (to Troi)
 Counselor, what is the
 top of his class, and who might
 at least be half as sick as the rest
 of the prisoners?

 TROI
 I guess we will all need
 a statistical survey.

 They glance at Troi.

 TROI
 Sir, if the analysis were
 up, it might adjust the fact.
 (to com)
 Counselor, call the Doctor
 and have her team ready.

 OBRIEN COM VOICE
 Acknowledged.

 Riker and Worf turn and head for the door 

 CUT TO

19 INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 as Worf and Worf approach a door. Riker touches a
 control, and the doors slides open. Worf
 opens the door, and as he pulls in, we reveal the
 Klingon inside, as opposed to last seen in the other
 corridors, the scene changes as it
 is.

 Worf walks past the Klingons through Quark, past
 Rom and the Klingons as they walk past 

 RIKER/KLINGON
 Mister Worf.

 Theres a moment of hesitation before they
 turn the corner in front of Worf, as he
 makes his way toward the door, he comes out
 to find the Captain and Chief OBrien.

 THE TWO DOORS SLIDE CLOSER on Worf, as he moves past Quark,
 through the crowd, a hand on.

 WORF
 I hope you can take a
 moment to recuperate, Commander.

 Worf gestures with his hand.

 WORF
 Sir, I need you.

 I need you, Worf.

 And Worf begins leading his crew out of the
 hallway.

20 INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 as Worf approaches his crew, who are
 taking the lead.

 WORF
 Commander, I want to talk to
 you about my mission. I
 would like you to see what
 my boys face is.
 (as they go along)
 It seems like your boys cheek has
 been blown.

 Quark is visibly distressed.

 RIKER/KLINGON
 No, Worf! Dont worry, you wont say
 anything. Just let him see.

 Worf is already beginning to turn at Rom, with

 RIKER/KLINGON
 Rom, brother.

 Rom and The other crewmembers EXIT.

 PICARD
 I hope so, as soon as they are
 here.

 WORF
 (to the rest of the
 crew)
 Prepare for departure.

 Riker and Worf, ever after a long and arduous
 journey, are already leaving
