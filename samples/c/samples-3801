======== SAMPLE 1 ========
OUNLY DISAPPEAR DISAPPEAR a handful of the
 objects. A BELL o.s.

 CHANG
 You are all right. Whats your name?

 BELL
 Vera. The Bajoran name.

 PICARD
 Vera.
 (beat, it seems)
 We have come here to deliver our
 manifesto.

 PICARD
 Yes, I was surprised you knew that.
 We are going to help the prisoners find
 a way to live but now
 theres nothing else on
 our minds.

 CHANG
 Thats it?

 BELL
 Yes!

 PICARD
 Your mind is racing -

 CHANG
 It will never stop - never
 stop losing its relentless pursuit.

39 INTERIOR MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD, TROI, TROI, WORF,
 DATA, PULASKI, WESLEY, FEMALE

 PULASKI
 How much longer?

 DATA
 It will take several hours at first.
 That seems to be all we are having
 at this time, Commander.

 STAR TREK " Icarus " - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT THREE 36.

39 CONTINUED

 PULASKI
 Data - we are getting reports of
 Bajoran casualties. At this rate it will feel
 a jolt to the entire solar system in less
 than an hour.

 INTERCUT

40 EXTERIOR TEN-FORWARD OLDERLY STREET - NIGHT

 Riker and Picard still sit and chat. The
 Bajoran bartender is dead silent, too.

 Riker and Picard get on with their plan.
 They are now going to the bar.

 DATA
 How much time do you need?
 (beat)
 As opposed to fifteen
 hours ago, I began my experiment.
 And what I found surprising is
 this the most advanced learning
 technique. But what caused that?
 It was designed to combat all
 manner of bodily damage.
 This is a very sophisticated
 neural transceiver. Very sophisticated.
 But I have never used it on an
 adult subject to test a method thats
 considered taboo.

 They were being served drinks, but it was
 still the same as the champagne?

 PULASKI
 Thats because the Dax that served
 the neural net.
 It seems that it works here.

 STAR TREK " Icarus " - 2/24/89 - ACT THREE 37.

40 CONTINUED

 Riker and Picard exchange glances. They are
 both looking down, but they are
 still both trying to comprehend.

 RIKER
 Its not like we have much of
 experience, and because our
 neural net wasnt designed to
 accommodate that. Instead, I found
 a way that will will accommodate
 myself.
 (beat)
 They should go right ahead and they will
 get a better idea.

 PULASKI
 Maybe we should just start with all
 the theories.

41 OMITTED

 RIKER
 The Dax we knew about is married.

 PULASKI
 I have never met her.

 RIKER
 Thats not a fact.
 (beat)
 She was here last night 
 in my bed.
 (beat)
 It seemed strange when she showed
 me the name "Nana
 Oda" three star of astrometrics.
 Her names got a little different.

 PULASKI
 I dont understand.

 RIKER
 Perhaps you will have trouble with
 that.

 PULASKI
 Or you might find out theres
 nothing there. But there are a dozen
 stars there, more than
 I can figure out how we got there?

 Riker looks pensive, trying to understand what
 are trying to explain. He goes back to work.

 STAR TREK " Icarus " - REV. 2/25/89 - ACT THREE 38.

41 CONTINUED

 PULASKI
 Thats right. Theres
 nothing there. But there have
 been a lot of them.
 (charming, friendly
 little smile)
 I guess they owe you a debt,
 Commander.

 RIKER
 Thats too personal,
 imbecile. How does that
 make you feel better?

 PULASKI
 Better than medicine, Commander.
 We dont know which side, which side
 we are on. But all my
 friends say my wife and I are the
 same. And shes married me.

 RIKER
 Well?

 PULASKI ISN
 Then thats it.

 PULASKI
 My first wife.

 RIKER
 Then Im asking with them. Which
 side?

 PULASKI
 I dont know
