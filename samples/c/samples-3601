 Dukat takes a few steps toward them 

 DUKAT
 There they are again. I
 find a human right. And
 its called being paid.

 (Dukat is smiling again)
 This is a simple transaction.

35A INTERIOR KLINGON CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

 Odo and Lwaxana ENTER and they start to MOVE down
 the hall. The lights have changed and the
 hallway is no longer a dim, menacing
 place it could have been.

 Suddenly, a massive Dukat figure emerges, leads Dukat
 toward the door. A few people are still getting ready to
move.

 Dukat stops and stares at the figure.

35F Dukat stops and faces the apparitor.
 He can clearly see the IMAGE of a ship and
 people inside the Great Link.

 as Dukat realizes what it is, places
 his face squarely between the faces of the
 stars. He is transfixed by the
 sight of the people on the viewscreen.

27 EXTERIOR SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) (STOCK)

 The ship seems a bit larger than a normal "
 station" orbiting Daxs ship.

28 INTERIOR SECURITY OFFICE

 Dax is talking to a slightly irritated Leeta about some
 station business.

 LEETA
 What are you doing here?

 DAX
 Making repairs.

 LEETA
 I found a problem. Its
 affecting my cloaking
 device.

 DAX
 (stressed)
 You are sure it wont affect
 your pilot?

 LEETA
 (a little more
 calm)
 Im not certain.

28A INTERIOR OPS

 Worf and Klitane at their stations. The
 Turbolift drops to normal and Dax is
 relieved of duty. Dax, frustrated with the lack
 of her replacement, storms into the
 Turbolift and heads in the
 opposite direction. As soon as she gets
 behind the Turbolift, she turns and heads back
 toward the Turbolift.

28B INTERIOR DEFIANT - BRIDGE - ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)

 Dax is staring out the windows. She reacts to
 something she sees - a vague outline of a figure.
 She reacts to it and rushes toward the Turbolift.

28C Dax pulls back behind her.

28D Dax grabs a security arm and points the
 rifle directly into the direction of the figure.

28E Dax has a feeling it might be a
 security emergency rather than a
 warning.

 DAX
 Im just checking the
 flow sensor logs but I have
 been reading sporadic readings
 from the outside 
 (indicating a look
 on the Console)
 - maybe we are looking at
 some sort of tactical
 mission 

 He nods.

28F Dax starts to get an idea - turns to an
 Okudagram

28F CONTINUED

 DAX
 I dont want to make another mark.
 It doesnt look like this is some
 kind of a problem 

 She looks away.

 DAX
 Just keep me posted 

 She EXITS and he is frustrated - his anger and feelings
 have overreacted
