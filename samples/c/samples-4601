======== SAMPLE 1 ========



 KIRA and I have brought the fight
 home, and I have won
 every time it has come to my
 attention and now you have brought
 it here. Why have you
 destroyed this entire Valinians
 ship. Why? Why have you
 betrayed us and destroyed it
 all? Why?! Why?!
 (trapped by
 Kirks sound)
 Why why? Because I said so.

 But Kirk now cuts Kiras again with a
 glance.

 KIRK
 (continuing)
 What are YOU doing? Let him
 win?

 BEVERLY
 There are so many questions!
 And one unanswered,
 is why. Isnt there anything you can
 do to help him? Why and
 why not?

 What is the hell that shes about to say?

 DATA
 (raspy)
 Why do you? You appear to have
 much to work with the Klingon
 authorities, and perhaps with
 us too 

 BEVERLY
 (not wanting to go
 on)
 You have already admitted that. There are
 too many questions.

 KIRK
 What about this? A time when you
 may be able to help him.
 A time when he may even
 feel your touch. Your
 knowledge and understanding of
 Starfleets customs are
 sufficient.

 BEVERLY
 But what is our knowledge and
 philosophy of life? If Dr.
 Data is correct, he
 may yet. We will
 still have to have men to perform.

 (beat)
 We will continue. But we need men
 to excel at each others tasks,
 to know the rules, the norms,
 the tools. And men
 must also excel at each others duties.
 (beat)
 Now you sound like a
 Ferengi.

 KIRK
 Absolutely. And thank you.

 Doctor Beverly nods and leaves. Data and Beverly EXIT.

 TASHA
 (worried)
 Wait, Captain I think you
 should leave.

 PICARD
 (puzzled,
 weary)
 I cant do it to your advantage.

 BEVERLY
 But theres an advantage to
 something I will be doing.
 (shaking her
 head)
 You are a commander in the Imperial
 Guard. The captains authority does
 belong to the captain.

 PICARD
 To what end?

 BEVERLY
 You are becoming a great leader.
 The people will follow you and
 you will have already proven your
 worthiness to rule a First
 Officer.

 Data and Beverly EXIT the scene.

20 INTERIOR CORRIDOR - UPPER LEVEL

 Data and Beverly exit the turbolift.

21
 INTERIOR RIKER QUARTERS

 Data and Beverly ENTER from the turbolift. They
 cross into the corridor and look in the
 dark corridors.

 DATA
 My quarters.

 Beverly pauses, looks over their direction. She
 raises her hand in surprise 

 BEVERLY
 (softly)
 I heard that before. I
 think you liked your hair.

 DATA
 When I have heard that I have
 had many requests for it.

 BEVERLY
 (soft)
 I have many requests 
 (beat)
 Have you ever had a wig?

 DATA
 Yes.

 BEVERLY
 It should start this.

 DATA
 (softly)
 Would you mind if I gave one
?

21 CONTINUED

 BEVERLY
 (softly)
 Would you mind if I show you
 one of those?

 DATA
 Certainly. But I would hesitate to
 give you his own personal opinion 

 BEVERLY
 I will keep your opinions. But if I
 had my doubts.

 Data crosses to the bench.

 DATA
 I do not believe a word you
 said until I have researched you
 thoroughly.

 BEVERLY
 The truth is, I have
 been feeling emotionally I have
 been sure about why that
 is - and I certainly have
 not enjoyed being your Chief.

 DATA
 That is clearly part of you and
 I therefore find it difficult to
 understand.

 BEVERLY
 Then you are saying I have
 felt emotionally responsible for what I have
 done. But so far, I
 feel neither emotions at the
 cost
