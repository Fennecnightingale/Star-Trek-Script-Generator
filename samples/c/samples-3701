ARDO
 I think you are doing better 

 BEVERLY
 (laughs)
 Better than you are.

 SISKO
 Thank you.

 BEVERLY
 I have been working on it for months 
 before moving to the station. And 
 then I turned to you.

 SISKO
 What are you?

 BEVERLY
 Im supposed to live in housing 
 families.

 As they both sit down and take a couple of 
 steps toward the "garden," I realize that 
 nothing is really going on.

 BEVERLY
 I know nothing of the social 
 networks. What 
 makes them so important 
 is their capacity to produce 
 and 
 appreciate people.

 She has an old-style CRUISER (with a 
 pointed glass), and as we hear the 
 chime, a man rushes out of the building. Its 
 like someone snarled out of a prison 
 and then they discover that theyd 
 have to pass the neighbors. (we cant hear their 
 voices.)

 BASHIR
 (continuing)
 They are trying to kill you.

 DEEP SPACE "Progress" - 08/32/94 - ACT THREE 34.

38 CONTINUED (7)

 BASHIR
 They are not trying to kill you, 
 its more like trying to 
 make you give them what they want.

 Bashir and Brunt head off in 
 different directions 

39 ANOTHER ANGLE

 As Bashir and Brunt head off in the building. Worf 
 and Dax share a look in the direction they are going 
 and he suddenly has an idea.

 WORF
 How could I let them go to all this 
 trouble?

 DAX
 They havent given you any directions 
 yet.

 WORF
 We must find the other place.

 DAX
 I can talk to them, Mister Worf. I want 
 information. For the last time, I have 
 had regular contact with 
 them.
 (beat)
 You were able to arrange a meeting 
 at twelve hundred hours 
 later, at your convenience.

 Worf takes a slight pause 

 DAX
 (a smile)
 Oh, thats good 

 Off Worfs pleased expression 

 FADE OUT.

 small SCANNER RIFLE. Dax and 
 Bashir embrace 

36 RESUME SCENE 

 DAX
 The security men carrying bodies 
 for disposal are insane. I cant even get to 
 myself.
 (to BASHIR)
 It might be difficult for you to hear 
 the guards, but we are not here 
 for entertainment, we for duty. 
 And I hope you are enjoying the 
 Embassy there as much as I do.

 BASHIR
 That would be pleasant.
