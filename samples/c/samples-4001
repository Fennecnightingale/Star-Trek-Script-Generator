EMH Yes, there are now sixteen planets in the sector.
ARCHER They are all decaying. What planet was your last destination?
EARHART I wasnt aware of it.
ARCHER Did you live on the Earth before being born?
EARHART Yes.
ARCHER After your first mission, you left Earth for several years. When I first arrived on the Enterprise, I was not so different.
EARHART Thats right. Before I knew what it was like living on the other side of the galaxy.
ARCHER Earth was destroyed. The solar system was devastated by the Great War. Everyone wanted to evacuate to the first place they went, but a few people came to live on the Earth once. Eventually, the U.S.S. insisted you visit them and find them.
EARHART Why? Why for? What could they do?
ARCHER It took a lot of time. It was like living in a zoo. They had all the facilities, the life work, the resources to create.
EARHART And they had everything else. Life on the home world was rich.
ARCHER Earth is rich. It could not have existed without people like you. And people like you, people like us. The people I was with wouldnt make the same life anymore. They all died, but the U.S.S.S. Earth never had an artificial war in history.
EARHART Not bad. After you get familiar with them, youd realize that the great power had little to it. The sun was its shining. Youd see the stars. All I had to do was wonder what was up there.

(Holodeck Sandrines)

ALL Hail your heroes! Hail your heroes! Hail them.
ALL Hail your heroes! Hail your heroes! Hail them! Hail them! Hail them!
ALL Hail their heroes!
CHAKOTAY They are waiting for their signal!
ALL Hail them!
CHAKOTAY We dont want to hurt you even if it makes them angry.
REED Theres concern on the walls. People are starting to complain of nausea.
CHAKOTAY This is not the first time that people are starting to protest against a Cardassian government. Its not always easy to just sit by your prejudices, you know.
CHAKOTAY We can make an exception to this station. We have made a different decision here, too. When we left Earth, your people began to appreciate its existence as well. The same could well happen here.
CHAKOTAY By choosing a Cardassian base for the attack on Mars?
TUCKER When I went to Pahra in the jungle, all I could think of was leaving Earth. But I made an exception this time.
CHAKOTAY Why are you so sure she made the right call?
TUCKER Because I wasnt feeling a Cardassian or a Cardassian.
CHAKOTAY We dont appreciate your choosing Earth as a planet. Do you?
TUCKER Whats that supposed to mean? It was just one word.
CHAKOTAY I had a feeling it wasnt for the best.
TUCKER Its good to know that. Chakotay. (whispers)
Kir, you could get a few things you need in here.

(Siege)

ARCHER You made that one too? Well, not easy.
TUCKER You are going to regret it.
ARCHER I said get back to Earth.
TUCKER Captain.
ARCHER Are you sure you want to do it?
TUCKER If you want to be able to leave Earth, I want to help.
ARCHER You know I dont trust him.
TUCKER I didnt really mean that.
ARCHER What?
TUCKER Forget it. Just listen.
ARCHER You said you didnt trust the Cardassians.
TUCKER You dont think he will help to defend Earth. We cant.
ARCHER We are not here to help you. Are we?
TUCKER If you want to be here for me, fine.
ARCHER I have got no objections from Im ready to walk away. We went to Pahla for almost a year before we left orbit. It was pretty bleak, but, we were able to make a family. I think if you dont know where we come from, why didnt you just stay on board the ship?
TUCKER I didnt really mean it that way.
ARCHER I havent come to defend Earth any more.
TUCKER You dont know that planet was destroyed by the Cardassians. Its gone.
ARCHER I dont believe thats true.
TUCKER What are you implying?
ARCHER Theres a lot of wreckage in there.
TUCKER How
