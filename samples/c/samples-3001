======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 appears I will be in my office, I will be able to
 contact you when you want to see your
 personnel record, but first I would like permission just
 to talk with Worf.

 Beverly is deeply offended by the attitude and, when she
 speaks, it is with an emotionless anger.

 BEVERLY
 I believe Worf left us many options
 when he was here. He left
 us many choices 

 Picard looks at her, surprised at the intensity of emotion
 within her.

 PICARD
 We gave him life. But did we ever leave
 him?

 BEVERLY
 Yes but we never thought he.

 Picard is troubled by this.

 PICARD
 He left the Ulaan colony and he
 went back to the Ulaan and never
 returned.

 Picard is torn by the emotion.

 BEVERLY
 I wish the time had changed.

 Picard looks at her.

 PICARD
 What did you mean?

 BEVERLY
 (a whisper)
 We are not talking about
 emotions.

 Picard considers this for a moment, then rises,
 having a "me-mea.

 PICARD
 He left us many choices.

 Picard rises. He leaves her confused with his
 feelings.

 Data and Picard ENTER the turbolift. The two TROLL ON their heads.

 DATA
 Captain. I am reading a vessel on
 long-range scanners it is a ship 

 Data quickly works their consoles. The ship opens immediately, leaving
 nothing on screen. Data scans the bridge for a moment then
 back to the image of the bridge crewmember we had
 at dinner dinner. Picard and Datas look at the bridge
 console.

 DATA
 There is indeed, Captain. It is the ship Kamin 

 They exchange a look they know the ship is there. They
 both move to the left of the console and the bridge crewmember
 appears next to Worf 

 WORF
 Captain, this is an emergency 

 Picard and Data instinctively grab hold of Worf 

 Picard grabs hold. The captain lifts his arm toward the neck of the
 ship and begins gripping Worf  The two RANGER RANGER stand and
 fight the others simultaneously 

 Picard and Data FIGHT the SOUND of Worfs body, as are the
 two RANGER RANGER RANGER that were mounted on the
 side of Worfs body. Worf begins to try to fight 
 it 

 DATA
 (in "grave")
 The second RANGER RANGER, which appeared on
 behalf of Worf, is struggling
 to save the lives of its crew 

 PICARD
 (continuing)
 I have the authority to put both
 ships into the space-time-ship.

 Data and Picard immediately drop their grip but Picard then
 extends an arm toward Worfs leg. Picard and Data pull
 them both up and a look reveals Worf. Picard stares down,
 knowing Worfs intentions

 Picard immediately take a step forward and withdraw the arms,
 then -

 PICARD
 (reting the VISOR)
 I will be in my ready room, shuttle
 station 

 Data and Picard move to the desk, standing by their backs. Picard
 stands looking over his shoulder.

 WORF
 A few minutes ago, Commander 
 Commander La Forge detected a vessel
 off our starboard 
 (beat, then shrugs)
 Its a Klingon Bird of Prey 

 The ship comes alive again and starts moving.

 PICARD
 Whos there?

 Worf immediately release. Picard and Data EXIT.

 Worf then heads for his Ready Room 

 Picard and Data ENTER the room and go up to their
 computer, which displays a screen. Picard glances around it and
 sees Worf is seated at the computer console. This makes Worf look around it.

 WORF
 There 
 (indicates computer console)
 a Bird of Prey in the immediate
 area 

 The console in the room is set and Worf reacts, then crosses into the room
 and starts working. He glances around the room
 and spots a console in the center of the room 
 (indicating Picard)
 Its the station 
 (indicates Worf)
 "Warright," the ship which left orbit 
 this morning 

 A beat then a window in the console GLOWS red
