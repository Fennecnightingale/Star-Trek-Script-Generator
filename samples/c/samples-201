WICHEB
 If you
 wanted to do that, you
 would have left a home
 behind. I know this, but this is an
 important day. It will shape my entire future.
 It will determine whether I want to be a
 citizen of the Empire.
 And it will determine whether I want to
 be a part of that empire or not.
 And now we turn to one another.
 And then?

37 NEW ANGLE

 With the last few days passing, Captain Sisko turns down the
 phaser and goes to his room after the last time.
38 OBSERVATION

 It would appear that Captain Kirk did not
 trust Sisko, and that there had to
 be more tension than we had ever come
together.

 CORRIDOR

 We would say that.
39 NEW ANGLE

 OBrien turns down the phaser and heads away from
 the Captain.

 OBrien heads for the door, his head still high.

 OBrien turns down the phaser and heads off the screen
 while Sisko continues at the Captain. He is not
 wearing his shirt. He looks
 like he can see the anger in his eyes.

 OBrien turns down the phaser, but Sisko remains on
 the screen for a beat.

 OBrien heads over to Sisko and puts his hand on his back.

 OBrien is holding some food, the kind that goes
 on the table. We do know that food that goes on the table
 is made from animal flesh.

 OBrien is no cook.

 OBrien stands up to make room.

 OBrien puts the food down on the table in front of the chef.

OBrien sits down. And as Sisko sees this, he says to OBrien
 while he sits,
 " I will be right back.

 SISKO
 Im afraid I will just
 be going to dinner tonight.

 OBrien sits up and nods thanks to Sisko, sitting, and then, to him,
 smiles to him. He sits down.

 OBrien heads down a table, but SISKO watches
 the table for a moment.

 SISKO
 Its just not so good.

40 NEW ANGLE

 While Sisko is at his table, he looks up at his tablemate, who sits
 just above, and smiles at the table, then moves up to his side of the
 table and sits up.

 SISKO
 Come back in a few hours, and tell me what Im
 gonna do.

 OBrien heads off the table. Sisko reacts to the table for a beat, then looks up at his
 table, smiles at the table, then looks up at his table.

 SISKO
 Im sorry.

 OBrien sees why he was so upset.

 OBRIEN
 Im sorry.

 SISKO
 It was our table, the captain.

 DEEP SPACE "Children" - REV. 3/17/97 - ACT THREE 32.


 The room is crowded and Sisko is there at the restaurant table.

 SISKO
 Where is your table?

 OBRIEN
 I cant say I like it. But I
 thought you said it was just my
 taste buds.
 It might have been.
 But I thought you were my
 taste buds too. You
 were my taste buds.
 (beat)
 Im hungry. Let me get me an a cup of tea. It
 tastes fine.
 (to the waiter)

 Please.

 The waiter delivers a plate.

 CUT TO
40 EXTERIOR BOUD

 Sisko brings a bottle of tea. He drops it for
 three to a table. At the counter, he glances up at Sisko.
 He stands up, nods thanks.

40A INTERIOR STORE (OPTICAL)

 As the waitress prepares a meal. Then, Sisko enters.

40B INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 As the restaurant prepares for dinner. As Sisko enters and sits on the table, the waitress enters. Sisko
 speaks in his own tongue in an effort to please his guests.

 SISKO
 Are our tables just the same?

 SISSKO
 Yes.
40C INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 As before.

 SISKO
 (sarcastic)
 We are just different places.

 SISKO (sarcastic)
 It is just that. We may be talking about
 different things.

 SISKO
 Why arent we talking?

 SISSKO
 Because there is no one else sitting here. We are
 guests at the restaurant who
 serve
