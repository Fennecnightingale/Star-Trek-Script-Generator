EP. But hes already here, and we wont let
 them down easily.

(Engineering)

NEELIX I did an earlier analysis and I was just going
to look at Kaminars console. I thought there was
some kind of subspace interference.
TORRES I dont believe my VISOR (OC) has caused this distortion.
NEELIX How long until we clear the warp gate.
TORRES In less than another two hours, the Kaminarra
will be in warp range.
NEELIX We cant suppress our systems unless we clear the warp gate.
TORRES (OC) Thats an important step forward, sir.
NEELIX I told the crew that the ships gonna be back in orbit.
TORRES If thats the way they want it to do, then they can expect us not
to come home.
NEELIX I will try, its the ship will not be as stable as our
ship.
TORRES (OC) We have got to keep the shields on. If it ever needs a
reset we will be back before we
TORRES (OC) Lieutenant, please take a few steps aft.
NEELIX (OC) Im not sure this will be a problem.
TORRES Well, if it does, we will be all right, Commander.
NEELIX Im sure you are.
TORRES All right, Im not. Lets go. I will need the Neacortics to hold
balance.

(Cargo Bay two)

TORRES I will need to try an hour before we hit the Kaminarra. Then
we should try again.
JANEWAY (OC) Torres to Neelix.
TORRES Hey, Im in here. I need you to bring her in.
JANEWAY (OC) Go. Youll see to the Bridge. I want you
to get out.
TORRES Sure I will.
JANEWAY (OC) Torres out?
TORRES (OC) Yes?
JANEWAY Torres to Neelix.
TORRES (OC) Sure, but I want to know if you try taking your eyes
off me, what you may not see inside them. I dont give orders. (the
Khal.)
TORRES Thanks. We will try again.

(Shuttle Bay two - Bridge)

TORRES Captain, the Khal is not responding.
TORRES (OC) Yes?
TORRES (OC) I have asked her several times to try and suppress the
subspace distortions.
TORRES (OC) Not just one. You can try and
TORRES (OC) I cant think of anyone else, Captain.
JANEWAY Tom here with Neelix.

(Shuttle Bay two - Bridge)
<|endoftext|>NEELIX Captain, the Khal is not responding.
TORRES (OC) Im sorry, Mister Neelix does not seem to like us 
SEVEN We have been attempting to suppress the
subspace distortion for the past week. It would
stabilise if you were here, Captain.
TORRES (OC) I dont believe why we must remain here for six hours

(Shuttle Bay two - Bridge)

TORRES What were this time?
KELIX The past week, I have looked at
Torres and I felt she was lying.
TORRES (OC) Then we just need two more moments to
clear the warp gate, then it will explode.
KELIX I cant think of one thing to clear the
up.
TORRES This is not a chance
TORRES And if we lose our sense of

(Shuttle Bay, Bridge)

TORRES Captain, I cant think of one thing to
clear the up. I hate these

(Shuttle Bay - Bridge)

TORRES And if we have to do that, we will die!
(Shuttle Bay, Bridge)
TORRES (OC) Captain! I cant believe this is necessary
at this point.
TORRES (OC) I dont like it for you, Lieutenant.
TORRES (OC) If I had to die for you?
 TORRES Im not. If you take on me, you will

(Shuttle Bay two - Bridge)
TORRES (OC) For as long as I can, I will die.
TORRES On what?
TORRES Because I dont want to.
TORRES (OC) I dont believe what Im trying to

(Shuttle Bay - Bridge)
TORRES This is terrible.
TORRES (OC) But if you dont stop, you will lose your
sense of humour, Captain.
TORRES I cant give you that, either.

TORRES (OC
