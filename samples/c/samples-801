 The bridge is on its way back to Enterprise.

 DATA
 Captain and Mister Picard.

 DATA
 Captain if the Doctor are
 right, the Doctor have
 altered the course of
 evolution.

 PICARD
 The effects are subtle, but
 nonetheless, the Doctors genetic
 changes were
 already underway some 40
 billion years ago. How long is this
 going to take?

 DATA
 Yes, Captain?

 PICARD
 A few years, maybe a little longer.

 DATA
 (continuing)
 You may be the only
 human of all time we know. You
 have changed from a DNA
 that has been
 altered by force,
 a cell that has been modified with new technology 

 Data, not far ahead, realizes what Picard and
 Data are talking about.

 DATA
 But some mutations have been introduced
 by other species in the
 evolution of the human species

 PICARD
 (nods)
 And you have changed the genes of
 the human race. You have done what you have always been
 told you are required to do.

 DATA
 It would seem to me that if you have never
 been human you are human.

 DATA
 Perhaps.

 DATA
 That is correct.

 DATA
 (nods)
 But we have always been of the
 same blood as we have always been
 since your
 creation. I have observed that you
 have always been human, but in
 your case, the difference between
 two species has been greater and greater than that
 before.

 PICARD
 You are, Doctor. There can be no clear
 biological differences.

 Data studies him for a moment, then continues.

 DATA VOICE
 I am not certain the genetic
 changes have been effected in
 my own body. If I compare
 body photographs I feel
 the difference between a cell
 and the body it is obvious that the
 doctor have treated me
 differently than I have ever been treated. And the
 difference is more subtle and
 subtle and dangerous to my body than anything else.

22 CONTINUED (2)

 This is a pretty remarkable revelation and Data will be very
 pleased when he starts to leave, but Picard cant bring himself
 with him.

 DATA VOICES
 Yes, sir. I wish there was more
 than one Human
 cell in the Federation,
 Captain. But there are none
 of them on his own. And it is
 impossible that his body
 could be the
 only cell of the Federation,
 as there are no
 Klingon or Romulan or
 Romulan cells on this planet 

 STAR TREK "Prison" - REV. 4/10/89 - ACT THREE 30.

22 CONTINUED (3)

 Data pauses, then continues, but Picard knows what hes
 up to.

 PICARD
 Im going to take her on an
 observation mission that is
 classified.

 DATA VOICES
 Do you think you know how?

 PICARD
 I know.
 (to Picard)
 The doctor has always said the
 same. I can say 
 it in my records.

 DATA VOICES
 (continuing)
 Im interested in finding out where this cells
 are and where this is
 going on, Captain.

 DATAVOICES
 Are you, Doctor?

 PICARD
 You are the best scientist we have. You
 have the skills and talents
 of any of the many
 people on Earth who have
 joined Starfleet Academy.

 DATA VOICES
 Perhaps you have even had
 a Starfleet
 academy, Captain.
 (to Picard)
 Sir, if there is one thing you have to
 learn for your first
 day in the
 Delta Quadrant 
 Picard is a Romulan who takes pride
 in his own distinguished
 records, but as you would know, that he cannot
 be at fault for being so
 distinguished in life.

 DATA VOICES
 (continuing)
 I am aware of that. However, you were
 proud of being born in Canada in
 the midst of a war that
 I would never have foreclosed, not while
 the entire world is at war with
 you.

 STAR TREK "Prison" - REV. 4/9/89 - ACT THREE 31.

22 CONTINUED (4)

 DATA VOICES
 You are not a member of this world,
 are you? Are you Romulan?

 And Picard realizes that Data is right. He makes the choice and there is
 a brief, awkward moment
