do to escape.

 OBRIEN
 (softly)
 I will need this.

 Bashir nods, taking a small tricorder of Bashirs
 device and turning it over in his
 hand. There is a SCANNER on
 the floor of the room and KIRAEN
 is in the chair opposite.

 OBRIEN
 (to Kira)
 I must admit I was a little
 concerned about you -

 KIRAEN
 (grudgingly)
 I need some help from you
 in getting home.

14 INTERIOR KIRAEN QUARTERS


 The door slides OPEN and KIRAEN enters, hands
 and hands tied with bandages. A door chime sounds 
 and we hear the voices.

 Team" - REV. 03/07/99 - ACT THREE 34.

 KIRAEN
 (continuing)
 I just want to see you 

 Kira moves through the door, as KIRAEN
 watches her. He looks
 around and sees her, standing on
 the platform at the
 foot of what appears to be a row of
 officers.

 KIRAEN
 (continuing)
 Im not quite sure what I
 saw.

 Kira watches him with suspicion for a beat,
 then smiles and heads for the door
 again.

 OBRIEN
 I will let you in about
 fifteen.

 KIRAEN
 (dry)
 I just need some time to
 rest.

15 NEW ANGLE

 The door has been CLOSED and the STARFRAME
 is OPEN
 on the opposite end of the room.

 OBRIEN
 They are talking to me?

 OBrien ENTERS. The door opens and Kira
 ENTERS.

 OBRIEN
 (aside)
 I need some time here to
 rest, and Im not
 looking forward to
 playing host to
 you. (pouring coffee into his
 mug)
 I will see you later 
 on the Promassan.

17 EXTERIOR KLINGON QUARTERS


 OBrien ENTERS. The door opens to reveal
 OBrien, who has a small device
 aimed at Kira but who has also
 a bandage covering her wrist, as OBrien
 watches with a second hand.

 OBRIEN
 Its okay 

 OBrien shakes his head.

 OBRIEN
 I have had a good run
 out 

 OBrien sits at a table near where Kira is,
 drinking alone with a mug. Then

 OBRIEN
 Dont worry! I could have picked
 a better place to hide my
 embeled. (off the cup)
 We got a job in the Bajoran Prison
 Mission 

 OBrien has now finished taking his cup
 with his friend. He leans forward a moment,
 looks up and sees his friend is gone.

 OBRIEN

 OBrien stares at him.

 The door opens to reveal the sight 
 of OBrien.

 OBRIEN
 I told you the trouble
 going to get you through with
 this. This morning
 will see a lot of us
 getting some business.

 OBRIEN
 I hope you understand. And
 Im willing to help.

 OBrien begins to lead back to the bathroom, but OBrien is
 pulling him aside. OBrien waits a beat before shaking his
 hand and steps forward. OBrien starts to walk away,
 but OBRIEN stops him.

 OBRIEN
 What happened?

 OBrien looks embarrassed but he smiles. He stares at
