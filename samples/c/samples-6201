 SISKO 
 Dukat - lets go through 
 the security grid one more time 
 I will leave the Dominion keep a 
 eye on them 

 DUKAT 
 You go, Defiant.

 Dukat, still somewhat harshly, turns away and moves 
 through some of the open panels in the corridor behind 
 Bashir enters the corridor, looking a little better at 
 them both. He moves to look down at a very 
 charred, well-timed Defiant, one that he 
 wasnt looking after.

 SISKO 
 You all right?

 DUKAT 
 Yeah, nice to see me 

 SISKO 
 I have to talk to the Chief 
 Officers over one hundred 
 kilometers outside the wormhole and 
 its nothing but a plasma 
 conduit no more.

42 CONTINUED (2) 

 DUKAT (Contd) 
 The Defiant was a Starfleet vessel and 
 operated under the Federation 
 directive to respond to our letter. I 
 wouldnt have tolerated the 
 Dominion even taking his own crew 
 in 

 SISKO 
 Did the Bajoran even take it in?

 DUKAT 
 No. They were just out doing 
 business.

 BASHIR
 Maybe the Cardassians were right that 
 it could have been just a 
 random chance.
 (a beat) 
 What are you doing to pass the 
 Bajoran?

 DUKAT 
 No, it didnt. At first. I wasnt even 
 here 

 BASHIR 
 Maybe the Cardassians didnt know 
 they were sent here - they could have 
 been monitoring us.

 SISKO
 So the Bajorans were unaware. 
 It sure was something Bajorans werent.

 DAX COM VOICE 
 Dukat - whats happening?

 DUKAT 
 Im worried about the wormhole.

 Sisko reacts.

 SISKO 
 I told you Dukat - if the 
 Dominion has been tracking the wormhole, they will send 
 us a shipment of dilithium to change the situation 
 and get us off our ship.

 DAX CORRIDOR 
 How are you 

 GARAK 
 It takes some getting used to seeing 
 him.

 SISKO
 Hes not going to give up the ship 
 by force, Commander.
 (to Garak) 
 You found that wormhole, dont you. 
 Garak to Sisko.

 Sisko turns around.

33 GARAK - SISKO

 OGarak sees something on the monitor.

 GARAK 
 Its coming at the border. Four hundred kilometers 
 away.

 SISKO
 Magnify sector three five five 
 point three two six 

 Garak sees a Dominion starship hovering above its nebula.

 SISKO
 Lock phasers with those 
 Federation ships.

34 NARADA

 A Cardassian warship is now in proximity to it. The Breen 
 Alliance can be seen moving by the Cardassian 
 Alliance.

35 GARAK (OPTICAL)

 The Cardassian ship follows the show on the monitor, then 
 reels out a phaser burst that hits a node on the 
 horizon only to disappear.

36 SCENE



 Sisko hits back into the monitor.

 SISKO
 (dazed)
 What the hell did you do to 
 that wormhole?

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Sons and " - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT THREE 36.

36 CONTINUED

 GARAK
 I had nothing to do with it!

 Dukat winces again.

 GARAK
 It had to do with you.

 SISKO
 (firm) 
 No, no, we have just to be on 
 our own.

 GARAK 
 Let me see 

 Suddenly a Cardassian ship, the Pralor, moves out to 
 a side of the nebula and crouches down at the 
 hull as the two Klingons draw onto the ship 

37 SCENE

 The Cardassians all get thrown off asÂ 
 the Klingons fire at them.

 GARAK VIN
 Right on the chin, Captain - they are on our 
 Starfleet ship -

 SISKO 
 Put them down.

 Garak smiles - he may well have been right 
 the first time for this.

 GARAK
