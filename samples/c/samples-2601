text - and a new security barrier will make the ship safer 
 for the inhabitants.

(Cargo Bay one)

MICHAEL Im not sure if we will hold that long.
JANEWAY Stay away from me. This is Captain Janeway and Science
 Officer John OBrien.

(Cargo Bay one)

MICHAEL I have a plan I have to work with you to help you protect the
sixty-seven people on board this ship.
JANEWAY You will protect my ship and a crew you care about. Then I
cant tell you anymore.
MICHAEL They are friends, John, but they are not my life.
They are just tools.
JANEWAY Why not?
MICHAEL I like you better.
JANEWAY Thats because you have the same potential as they do.
MICHAEL You are flawed. You are just as unique, but
we will do it together. We will find a way to protect my crew from the
pain of forgetting what happened right before you joined the project.

(Cargo Bay one)

JANEWAY Now, you can do this if the people on the station know that this is my plan.
And if they dont, your people will stop you from doing it - and youd be dead.

(Cargo Bay one)

JANEWAY We must do this.

(Cargo Bay one)

JANEWAY What if I kill my Captain?

(Cargo bay one)

JANEWAY We are going to have to do this.

JANEWAY The sooner we talk?
MICHAEL Yes. The time to prepare.
JANEWAY You have already shown great care for your crew. I wonder
if you can show them even they are dead.
MICHAEL Yes. For your own benefit.
JANEWAY You said you think youd ever see any of those people again.
MICHAEL Not anymore. I have been looking out this
for three years. Nothing has worked. No progress. A year ago 
JANEWAY Is this project over you - or us?
MICHAEL No. My own life is full of choices, but I have been waiting
for someone.
JANEWAY You have waited a long time. I will prove your wrong.
MICHAEL Not that I ever was. I will finish the work.
JANEWAY I promise we will.

(Cargo Bay one)

JANEWAY I think we will hit three key areas, but I feel
we need to get out of here.
MICHAEL How wrong?
JANEWAY All you need to do is get out of there.
MICHAEL No, not yet.
JANEWAY Well, because the Captain isnt Captain and not a
human he can get a Captain to show him he
cares well. But he does know thats not going to happen. We will
cork from the ciderine.
MICHAEL No, no, not yet. When this project is finished, you will take care of all
the people who were on board. Now, you will take the
responsibility.
JANEWAY We will leave.
MICHAEL Michael?
JANEWAY Whats the use?
METRON I will take some readings. You will know how
this is worth, Michael.
EMH My crew may not be immortal, but our
knowledge of their lives and our history shows that we
can accomplish their goals without them.
EMH But we dont risk destroying them.
MICHAEL Not as long as you are here!
JANEWAY But we have to tell its true.
MICHAEL I know it. Its only a matter of getting out of there. You
dont know what that is. A ship can take a lot of
training.
JANEWAY You will work with him, all right, and I will teach you
things.
MICHAEL No.
MICHAEL Michael, you must. Dont talk to me. You are dangerous.
If you let him work this project without any success.
You are going to end up like Tom Paris.
JANEWAY No, not exactly. Dont talk to me anymore. All right? You are with me!
You know I will not talk to you anymore.
MICHAEL Okay.
EMH I know you. I knew I couldnt stand this
project.
MICHAEL Im not a hero just anymore.

(Cargo Bay One)

JANEWAY Dont cry.

(Cargo Bay one)

JANEWAY Im just trying to protect you and your crew.
