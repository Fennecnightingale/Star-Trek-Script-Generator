74C, or one of the other Bajorans
 may take that as a valid
 indicator of the success of his plan.

 RIKER
 I could be mistaken. Or maybe
 bad.

 WORF
 Or one of the Bajoran cultists.
 Or one of the Ales on
 the lower continent.

74J CONTINUED (2)

 RIKER
 But why?

 WORF
 They are unconnected with the
 other Bajoran sects.

 RIKER
 Maybe thats true, but I cant
 think that leaves them
 any hope of becoming a
 member of the group.

74J CONTINUED (3)

 KIRA
 What about the other five members
 of the away team?

 RIKER
 All of them leave the Bridge.
 All go to the Infirmary. You
 cant let them get away.

 KIRA
 Then you do us both a favor.

 Riker nods and they EXIT.

74I INTERIOR GUEST QUARTERS

 Seska is tidying up somewhat aimlessly, lost in
 thought. It seems to her that the door on the
 other side of the house has been left open and everyone
 left in there is inside, as if on a moment ago, but
 Seska is just trying to keep a cold look on her face.

 SESKA
 I guess if you ask me 
 no more questions? Maybe not.

 SESKA
 I will just have something to think
 about.

 As she stands, there is a flash of lass.

79 EXTERIOR KAMIN HOUSE - NIGHT

 The light is now. The house is dark. She takes a breath,
 feels a rush of emotion.

 SESKA
 We are on the Enterprise?

 The door opens and she outranks her way.

80 CLOSE ON PICARD

 He still holds her gaze, but its getting
 stranger by the moment.

 PICARD
 (continuing)
 Yes, but for how long? I can
 tell you only time.

 She reacts. Relieved.

 SESKA
 It is going to be all right.
 (as she backs out)
 I will do fine.

 She turns to move to the window and he follows with
 a smile. She looks him straight through.

 SESKA
 This is the answer. The
 secret is to never let your
 secret go. Thats how you do at one
 thing or another.

81 INTERIOR ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

 The other four members of the away team react - some
 tremble, even Scott. Seska takes the commanding
 position.

 SISKO
 How strong is the beam?

 WORF
 It will be strong until the
 ground is completely saturated.

81 CONTINUED

 SESKA
 Then what? We cant hope to
 outrank the others.

 WORF
 We will do the best we can I
 wish you would - and keep that
 beam strong.

 SESKA
 Thats not enough! We are out
 of range. We are out of range.

 Worf looks up at the others. This is tough for
 her, but she knows she has no place else to go.

 WORF
 Not if I can help it.

 He turns and moves to leave.

 SESKA
 Let it go.

 And she feels it, but the others are left less
 able to argue.

 WORF
 How heavy are the beams,
 Scott?

 SESKA
 They are heavy.

 WORF
 Then let it go.

 She turns to the others.

 SESKA
 Let it go.

 As they step out of the turbolift, she stares into
 their eyes. For a time, she speaks quietly, but
 there is a tenderness that burns burning into her.

 SESKA
 Let it go.
