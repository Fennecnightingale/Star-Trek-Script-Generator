 Look, Romulan Senator, I 
 didnt want anything from

 life. (off their look) 
 If theres anything I want 
 to get back to you, I will let 
 you know. 
 She smiles, stands, turns her attention on him. 
 ZORABA 
 I will be on there 
 (trying to convince 
 herself) when I get back 
 to my quarters.

 be easy.
