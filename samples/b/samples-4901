 to the 
 past. I am only half-human. 
 (then she rises to leave) 
 KIRK You mean? 
 SPOCK No. 
 SPOCK I assume that she means it. She musters some sort of 
 nervous reaction. 
 KIRK Whats going on here? 
 SPOCK Not that I can answer. 
 KIRK Well, there must be something we can do for you about it. 
 (Spock goes down to study a painting) 
 SPOCK Identify yourself. 
 KIRK Paint. No sketch. No sketch. No ideas. No ideas. 
 KIRK Well, the idea of painting is definitely attractive. 
 KIRK But what about it? 
 KIRK Yes, there is. 
 KIRK What about it? 
 KIRK Yes, there must be something we can do for you. We call it the White 
 Ink. The problem with the old fashioned way of life. 
 KIRK And what about the old fashioned way of life? 
 KIRK Of course. Its not that simple, and frankly I 
 know how to get past that barrier, Mister Spock. 
 KIRK I am sure that, Mister Spock. You go first. 
 SPOCK No, this idea of painting, is that it also takes an 
 emotional and physiological 
 personality at play. 
 KIRK That will get over. No, no, no. Not easily. 
 SPOCK We will need help, Captain. Help! 
 KIRK If we can handle it 
 (as the ship enters the asteroid) 
 (Bridge) 
 (Space debris. A landing ship approaches) 
 SPOCK Fascinating. 
 KIRK How did these things get here? 
 SPOCK Not by design, Captain. These things must have been an organic 
 element the asteroids meteor made it. 
 KIRK An artificial intelligence. I mean, it requires intuition. 
 SPOCK Precisely. 
 KIRK The problem with the planetary control systems is simple. We cant simply 
 turn the controls into blind. 
 SPOCK The astrometric staff was more correct, Captain. 
 KIRK But we will be ready to do it. 
 SPOCK And at critical mass we will not cope with this problem for some time. There 
 is time to learn. To study, to meditate. 
 (Bridge) 
 SPOCK Immensely. 
 KIRK All right. We will try to come up with a plan. 
 SPOCK I need more time. 
 KIRK Yes, yes, we will. Computer, begin programme.

 CHEKOV I have never seen Greerian in this sector before. 
 SMILEY I know him, we played to his liking. 
 CHEKOV Well, we are not quite friends yet. 
 MILEY So you already have. 
 CHEKOV No? I mean, we. We dont know what hes 
 up to. 
 MILEY We do it, we just let him go. 
 CHEKOV We are not exactly privy to Greerian. 
 MILEY Hes ours. We dont mind if you want to see him. 
 CHEKOV Thats what we are thinking. 
 MILEY He has a sense of humour, wont you say? 
 CHEKOV This is none other than a healthy male. We have been working 
 together for six months. 
 MILEY But six months? You are thinking of him. 
 CHEKOV Oh, that is not much time. 
 MILEY At a time when you wouldnt be able to do what he says, 
 you, you cant just stand there and do nothing while you still can. 
 CHEKOV No. 
 MILEY Then what? 
 CHEKOV Im not joking, you are. 
 MILEY No! No, no! No, no, no! 
 CHEKOV You must realise Greerian is highly intelligent. He can very easily control 
 himself. 
 MILEY No, no, no. No, no, No! 
 CHEKOV What is it? 
 MILEY We cant just sit here and do nothing while we are out here. 
 DEKOV Sir, briefing personnel report, stardate 45616.9. Commander Riker, 
 issue number four. Greerian to engineering. You may have found a personal 
 vulnerability in the meteor shower. This is a plan which, in turn, proposes a 
 new, more permanent solution
