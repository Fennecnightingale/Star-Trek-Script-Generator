 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
 A Cardassian disruptor. 
 Weyoun stands in the middle of this group and 
 speaks clearly. 
 WEYOUN 
 Our new objective was to 
 pacify the populace at large 
 gatherings like these. 
 The purpose of the shaka is to 
 deter people from taking action. 
 Weyoun speaks for all to hear. 
 WEYOUN 
 We will begin a nationwide 
 mass mobilization - 
 demonstrations, protests, people doing 
 anything to support 
 this cause. 
 Weyoun reaches for a jar containing an orange ball 
 wrapped with colorful symbols. 
 WEYOUN 
 I hope that all goes well. 
 Dax picks it up and tosses it 
 behind her head. 
 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
 It seems unlikely. The 
 movement began almost ten weeks 
 ago and there are no records of 
 previous protests. 
 WEYOUN 
 Over the past two weeks. We 
 heard that a government official 
 in a city was assassinated. He could 
 have been killed. 
 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
 That could explain why we have heard 
 nothing more. 
 WEYOUN 
 How the hell are you without an identity 
 or even a name? Any ideas on 
 new ways to organize the resistance 
 to Cardassia. 
 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
 Weyoun is leading a conference on 
 the Cardassian Central Command. 
 WEYOUN 
 How many people are you talking 
 about? 
 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
 About three hundred. 
 WEYOUN 
 Thats hard to believe. The last 
 we heard what happened to Odo, he 
 was nine months old. 
 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
 So if he were nine years old 
 too, and if he came in today, 
 he might have been a part of the 
 resistance? 
 WEYOUN 
 (nods) 
 That still applies. Odo 
 could be an example. The movement 
 has gotten so long, Odo is becoming 
 a leader almost everyone knows what he 
 wants. 
 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
 (nods) 
 I have a lot of things I cant 
 remember from the conference on 
 Cardassia. Things that happened to 
 Odo after he was exposed. 
 WEYOUN 
 Nothing happened to him. It 
 was like hearing whispers. 
 FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 
 You dont understand. The Secret 
 Operation felt it necessary to explain 
 everything. It was a meeting 
 you went to and hearing 
 what everyone was to say. 
 WEYOUN 
 Actually, I was lucky. I 
 had people who were sympathetic 
 to me. People who werent there 
 expecting me. Now people who 
 would say that I know exactly what 
 right people can do to people who have 
 problems. Im going back 
 to put that on their 
 face. 
 KIRA 
 I will have it made to Quark. I 
 dont need any more lectures 
 from you. 
 YOSTAY 
 Thanks. 
 
 Dax takes a breath as they watch her go we

 11 EXTERIOR INTERIOR SECURITY 
 Odo, in handcuffs, leads BASHIR and MORN walk the 
 way to a room - the woman carrying a purse of 
 roses in her hands. Weyoun is sitting at 
 one side of them, staring into her eyes. 
 ODO 
 I hope everyone in this station 
 feels that. 
 MORN 
 Of course I do. I have always 
 found people who try to convince 
 others of their own. I have always 
 believed that good people trying alone gain 
 the respect of the good, even as good 
 people trying to convince others. 
 (smiles) 
 I think you have got to be one of the 
 good people in the world right now. 
 ODO 
 (simply) 
 Who did you think you were talking 
 about when you tried to gain my 
 respect? 
 MORN 
 People who try to convince others of their 
 own. I know how it 
 works
