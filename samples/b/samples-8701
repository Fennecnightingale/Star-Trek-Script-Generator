======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 NISKO 
 Its a Klingon honor. 
 
 KOLRAMI 
 Honor is cheap. 
 She moves to Kolkars side. 
 KOLRAMI 
 (repeating the 
 challenge) 
 Am I worthy of your scorn? 
 (challenging Worf) 
 Who are you to mock? 
 Worf easily answers her challenge, then 
 moves back to the mock. 
 WORF 
 I am called Rozhenko. 
 His mocking voice spreads across the room. He stares 
 at the image of the boy for a moment, then calls 
 out to her. 
 WORF 
 He is the son of 
 Mogh, and he is 
 prepared to challenge me. 
 KOLRAMI 
 (sarcastic) 
 Have you chosen him for your 
 personal benefit? 
 Worf finally comes to a decision about how 
 to keep his word. 
 WORF 
 Yes. 
 KOLRAMI 
 (sarcastic) 
 It would be illogical to assume 
 anything on the child 
 is sacred. 
 (picks up book) 
 All of our ancient texts describe 
 the monster as a primal, 
 evil-like figure. Perhaps 
 the Talosian Children 
 could be the first to formulate 
 that phrase. 
 WORF 
 The Child is a part of 
 the pattern. A wise 
 interpretation 
 It is also a symbol of the 
 struggle that the human 
 species has 
 experienced. If we allow 
 ourselves to experience it 
 personally 
 WORF 
 You are not part of it. 
 KOLRAMI 
 What brought you to Metall 
? 
 STAR TREK "Reunion" - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT TWO 24. 
 24 CONTINUED (3) 
 WORF 
 For the first time in our history 
 a child has been separated from its 
 mother. 
 KOLRAMI 
 It is a rare gift. If a 
 Talosian child does live with a 
 parent, they gain a chance 
 to recognize their mothers. 
 Worf looks to Kolkars wife, who looks at it with concern. 
 25 INTERIOR MEETING HALL 
 Kor, Worf, and OBrien are all 
 looking at a monitor displaying Dominion ship 
 operations. There is a series of SCREENS - some 
 of them ALIEN, some not. At the top of the 
 screen we can see the shapely rear end of a 
 Talosian ship. 
 OBRIEN 
 (reading) 
 the Talosians have 
 changed course to intercept 
 the Garenor star. 
 KOLRAMI 
 Changing course and heading 
 this way 
 As OBrien works his controls 
 26 INCLUDE MONITOR 
 which shows an OKUDAGRAM image of a Talosian 
 ship. (This is the "Q" 
 viewscreen.) 
 OBRIEN 
 Its the one showing the 
 fight between the Badlands and the 
 JemHadar. Do they 
 want us to change their 
 approach? 
 KOLRAMI 
 They do. I just saw one of 
 their ships on the monitor. 
 OBRIEN 
 But they are thin and light. 
 They should be a little more open 
 than before. 
 KOLRAMI 
 Why dont tell us about them? 
 OBrien freezes. One look at his mother, then another 
 before putting a comforting hand to Kolkars 
 face. 
 OBRIEN 
 I dont know some way of 
 handling this, but for the 
 moment, I think you are right. 
 (re her batleth) 
 My batleth is like a shield. 
 But like the bird of prey, theres a certain 
 pride in my achievements, as I always do 
 with my family. 
 (a beat) 
 I still do justice with my 
 family, Sarek. I slay what I kill 
 to satisfy my thirst for revenge 
 that goes with every life I kill 
 to answer your question I 
 do with every day. 
 KOLRAMI 
 (reading) 
 You have committed many crimes of 
 terrorism 
 OBRIEN 
 (re his own 
 batleth) 
 And you did what some would call 
 a heroic 
 violation of the law. 
 And they punish you
