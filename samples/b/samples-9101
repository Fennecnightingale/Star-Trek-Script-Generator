 Dax is startled and confused, but suddenly realizes that 
 KIRA 
 Commander I was the first one to 
 develop the tractor beam but 
 we had no tractor beam. I 
 panicked and docked. Our entire ship 
 had a ruptured core. 
 She works her console for a moment-frame, 
 then gives a mechanical look of relief and 
 then has to be quiet and secure her voice as she 
 presses a few buttons to move the console forward 
 KIRA 
 (off console) 
 All stop . 
 Worf is not answering immediately and the ship moves 
 away as Kira moves to get in front of him 
 KIRA (O.S.) 
 (quietly to Kira) 
 I have been working to do this for 
 the past twenty-two hours.

 And Im getting some time away

 Look at this

 It will be a while before the

 Sisko, Kira, Dax, Odo, and Dax at their positions 
 look at each other with mounting tension. Approaching at the 
 turbolift, the door CLOSES behind him 
 KIRA 
 What happened, Commander? 
 ODO 
 (in fullness) 
 Remudimentary, considering the 
 damage we caused, but we are going to be 
 all right. 
 As they all look down at the console, Dax tries to get up and 
 moves to it to get at the computer panel

 Dax works for a moment is at what she thinks is Daxs best 
 seat to get in front of an away team, then she tries 
 to get her back in the chair. 
 DAX 
 There. 
 (strokes her panel controls) 
 Set a course for the Bajoran 
 border. 
 Worf, Dax, and Odo set to the turbolift and face each 
 other as they wait they all head back to the ships 
 quarters after this 
 16A EXTERIOR LAB AREA - NIGHT 
 Bashir can see Dax and Kira coming. Bashir 
 moves to take Dax, Kira and Worf out of the way as 
 they move through the deserted tunnels. The moment passes as they move through the 
 cramped space 
 BASHIR 
 (to Kira) 
 We have cleared the interior of 
 the tunnels. Be ready to execute 
 orders. 
 OBRIEN 
 (working) 
 All right. 
 Bashir crosses back to Kira, leaving Kira alone in the 
 Cargo Bay. 
 KIRA 
 (to Worf) 
 The ship? 
 Worf looks back at Kira, who shrugs modestly. 
 KIRA 
 (sarcastic) 
 Do you have any idea what kind 
 of life here must be on? 
 The Klingon at the door, as though he knew someone was coming, 
 moves to get his bearings and then meets with Dax at a table, 
 utensils hes always had a conversation at.

 KIRA 
 I want to know her 
 familys history and their 
 actions. Is this Garrett? 
 Worf considers Bashir. For a moment hes as close to 
 his chest then leans toward Kira. 
 Dax tries to get up as the JemHadar looks at 
 Kira with admiration. 
 WORF 
 (working) 
 I will notify you once Doctor Crusher and 
 Doctor Crusher are on the 
 surface. 
 A small silence settles between them 
 KIRA 
 There. 
 It does something, and Bashir can tell that Kira is 
 really concerned about her people 
 opinions hes finding a way to keep his
