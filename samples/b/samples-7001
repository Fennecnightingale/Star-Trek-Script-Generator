======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 my have been trying to 
 figure out if theres a 
 psychological connection between humans and 
 Vulcans. Its quite a simple process. 
 A key and recurring process in 
 your genetic structure that you must 
 deconceive into something you 
 cant identify. 
 DATA 
 I discovered eighteen different 
 sequences throughout my research. 
 Most of them, though I might try 
 to isolate them in particular. 
 The only one Im looking for is 
 (overlapping) 
 And the only to come up with 
 that answer appears to 
 be the Genome. 
 DATA 
 (suggestions) 
 In essence what my research 
 about genetic engineering. But 
 the analogy does not 
 fit in that paradigm. 
 I find this process quite 
 fascinating. 
 PICARD 
 (to Data) 
 Continue. 
 DATA 
 (to Picard) 
 This is for your benefit. 
 PICARD 
 For your benefit. This is for my 
 idea of the genetic structure in my 
 brain. 
 Data is standing at the head of the conference table, 
 impressing both parties about something familiar. 
 DATA 
 (continuing) 
 I found that genetic structure 
 structure in the posterior lobe. Prove. 
 He taps a control and this is Data, starting for a 
 moment. The surrounding vessels begin to move. At the same 
 moment, this one of them comes free in front of our team. They 
 are moving to the side and Data has immediately pulled the 
 off, stepping into the center of the room. 
 PICARD 
 Is that clear?

 13 CONTINUED (2) 
 DATA 
 Yes, sir. This is very strong 
 evidence, Captain. It 
 appears to be generated by a strand 
 of DNA. This is a 
 major complex. I can 
 synthesize the DNA molecules directly in this 
 generation. 
 PICARD 
 Is that possible? 
 DATA 
 (shakes head) 
 None of this would be good. 
 (to Picard) 
 None of this would be. 
 Data bends down and quickly works the controls. 
 DATA 
 All of these messengers. They appear 
 to be generating synaptic impulses. 
 PICARD 
 (to Data) 
 Do you know how many different forms 
 they appear to be? 
 DATA 
 I do not know. But it seems to 
 be generating signals. 
 (MORE) 
 17 CLOSE ON PICARD 
 As he scans the room. 
 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 Interesting. Lets get you closer. 
 (to Data) 
 How far do they seem to grow? 
 STAR TREK "Realm of Ill" - 12/23/92 - ACT TWO 20. 
 17 CONTINUED 
 Data doesnt answer. 
 DATA 
 (continuing) 
 Unknown. But they appear to be 
 stored in the molecular structure 
 of their cell structure. 
 PICARD 
 (to Data) 
 Howd they respond to those 
 nucleic nucleicings? 
 DATA 
 (continuing) 
 As they get nucleicase-encased 
 within their cells, then it would seem 
 to be influencing the cell structure. 
 PICARD 
 (to Data) 
 Why would the nucleicine seem to be 
 modifying DNA? 
 DATA 
 Likewise. I believe that the 
 structure of the cell structure could have 
 been modified by the event that my 
 cell structure was regenerating. 
 They all think for a beat. 
 DATA 
 (continuing) 
 But such a transformation would 
 seem to be taking the DNA with 
 us into their system. 
 PICARD 
 (puzzled) 
 And where is the origin of the 
 mutation? 
 DATA 
 Unknown, sir. Cant find out for definite. 
 PICARD 
 (to Riker) 
 How did that morph into weapons? 
 (to Data) 
 Computer, scan All the nucleic 
 sequences in the nucleic structure. 
 Analyze molecular structure of nucleic molecules. See if you 
 find any nucleicine chains. What if 
 the nucleicine chains are repeating?
