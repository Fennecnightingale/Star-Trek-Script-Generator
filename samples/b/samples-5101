 matter how many people are 
 inside. 
 WORF 
 What are they doing here? 
 Picard and the others exchange a bewildered 
 look. 
 DAWID 
 The captains conducting a medical 
 expedition to find the answers. 
 No one will come aboard unless 
 its a distress 
 signal is received first. 
 WORF 
 You heard the Captain. Everyone stay 
 in the ships bay until they find 
 the signal and stop 
 their instruments.

 DAWID 
 We are not making peace with these people, 
 Captain. 
 She starts to move off, but stops and then smiles at the others. 
 DAWID 
 They have a message. They have 
 they have brought a virus. This is only 
 an isolated phenomenon. 
 WORF 
 They have no idea they are 
 infecting it. 
 DAWID 
 (off their reactions) 
 We should know. They look like 
 a subspace virus.

 Picard listens to 
 WORF 
 (continuing) 
 For this man, the only safe way to end 
 the Pandemic is to end 
 the patient, of course. He 
 understands, but hes not about to let it slide 
 like this.

 WORF 
 There is a survivor aboard 
 that ship from the future has 
 not been discovered. 
 Picard looks over his shoulder at Worf for a moment 
 then 
 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 This is not about a virus. 
 Perhaps 
 Worf is right. But there is another 
 way to deal with it 
 WORF 
 The only way to deal with the 
 unknown is to eliminate 
 the entire area with 
 counterviral therapy. 
 PICARD 
 Mister La Forge, I agree with 
 what you are doing, Mister La 
 Forge, in the interest 
 of your medical 
 research. 
 WORF 
 Captain, I have an arrangement 
 which 
 offers us both every opportunity to probe 
 the minds of a patient 
 in Sickbay. 
 
 PICARD 
 An away team should be at least 
 equipped with sub- 
 subspace radio so as 
 Commander Riker has his chance to 
 scan his mind. 
 
 WORF 
 And we will do our best to find 
 out why.

 PICARD 
 And I intend to help you 
 as soon as we reach the bridge, 
 you will be free to 
 explore the uncharted galaxy. 
 Worf and the others glance around the room, 
 trying to make sense of everything. 
 RIKER 
 A journey like this only 
 offers up a few openings in your 
 psychosophical search. 
 WORF 
 It opens the door.

 WORF 
 But in many ways it is the only way 
 to keep your mind off the 
 problems. But more 
 important, if you do find 
 an opening in that room by 
 my side, we can offer our 
 assistance. A 
 Huron and a hand in the door. 
 As, before they move away, we hear the ship begin 
 to move. 
 A beat. Worf and his crew turn to watch an opening opening hatch along with 
 the shuttlecraft. 
 WORF 
 (continuing) 
 Your shields are failing, 
 and the injector tubes have dried.

 15 CONTINUED (4) 
 The shuttle craft moves to a platform, which is moving toward them with 
 great care and dignity. 
 RIKER 
 What about the Huron? 
 WORF 
 Your shields will not stop 
 withstand it. 
 The Huron is about to move away, then suddenly
