======== SAMPLE 1 ========
  I was thinking Id offer 
 to help. 
 Worf reaches inside and pulls out a phaser rifle. He checks a readout 
 on it, then 
 WORF 
 Would you like a drink tonight? 
 He leads the 
 23rd FOINT 
 at the bar. A huge Klingon watch (like yours) 
 beamed to the room. (It is the 
 Klingon equivalent of a big boy with his 
 whisk or a dagger) is set 
 for the bar 
 WORF 
 (re the Klingons) 
 I am here to serve as your 
 personal gladiator. 
 GOWRON 
 (a little shocked) 
 You mean that? 
 WORF 
 Yes.

 23 CONTINUED 
 WORF 
 So it doesnt matter if you are 
 holosuite or not 
 (beat) 
 But the Klingon Empire has to 
 be in full agreement 
 to respond to that 
 Worf is about to insult this 
 honor with the 
 Klingon 
 (re the Klingon) 
 well, he makes a mistake 
 (reassuring) 
 Klingons are too gullible 
 for anything to see. 
 Suddenly the Klingon on the bar 
 steps up to his full imposing height, and 
 for a split-second we can see a face 
 of pleasure erupting on his face 
 He smiles his bright smile 
 Worf listens. 
 WORF 
 (off-screen) 
 What have you to say to that 
 Klingons? 
 A Klingon 
 WORF 
 (re Klingons) 
 You are not Klingon. 
 A Klingon gesture. 
 A Klingon take a guess 
 of it. Worf studies that 
 face

 WORF 
 (re Klingons) 
 They are so similar. They are 
 indistinguishable from one another. 
 WORF 
 One is Klingon. And if we are 
 not, I will exclude you. 
 WORF 
 What would be the point? 
 A Klingon 
 Worf is immediately concerned and he fights the 
 impulse to tell the truth. 
 WORF 
 And that is not their concern. 
 A Klingon would not lie to a lie. He takes 
 that lie and holds it up to his head, 
 testing it. 
 WORF 
 Would you like me to take a 
 Klingon hideant? 
 He nods with satisfaction. Worf takes a 
 sip of bloodwine. 
 WORF 
 Good. 
 Worf clinks his glass in a toast, and then slumps. 
 WORF 
 (re Klingons) 
 That is a Klingon drink. Now drink 
 Klingon ale.

 23 CONTINUED (3) 
 He holds it to Geordi with his other hand, 
 closes the glass, and pushes it between 
 Klingons to his lips. 
 Worf takes a drink, then sets it down before 
 snitting at his lips, and then takes it back up to 
 the bar for a Klingon drink. (NOTE This should be a 
 clean one, not a Klingon cocktail.) 
 WORF 
 (re Klingons) 
 The Klingon style of drinking 
 Klingons is different from a Klingon 
 Empire, which is more politically 
 liberal. On the face 
 of Worf, there is a 
 little more in his demeanor, more 
 confident than before. 
 WORF 
 I am Klingon. 
 Theres an odd moment when they stare 
 at each other in an indescended, 
 bewildered silence. Then, with a 
 Klingon bartender serving a Klingon 
 beverage, Worf goes over to the bar and joins his 
 friends. He sets the cup down near Laforge, and then he 
 goes over to Worfs face. 
 WORF 
 I am not only half-blooded, 
 but I am also half- 
 intelligent. If you 
 were not to encounter my 
 prejudices - in fact 
 you are something of your 
 intellectual abilities could 
 be very useful to the 
 leader. 
 WORF 
 Im sure it is.
