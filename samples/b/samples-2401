 BOSIAH 
 Its too late. You are supposed to be a 
 familyman. When we were growing up 
 we assumed that people 
 had careers in 
 science and literature, 
 that they loved our 
 books.

 BEVERLY 
 (nods) 
 We thought that one of the 
 ways of showing appreciation for the work 
 that it was so hard 
 to do was that every department had a 
 priority, a priority 
 that they did not forget about 
 - an order. 
 The idea that the whole crew was focused 
 on excellence 
 is beginning to appeal to Data. 
 DATA 
 (emphatic) 
 It is not easy to say that 
 the entire crew is motivated. I believe they are motivated 
 to believe that the entire crew is motivated. 
 GEORDI 
 No, no. That is a big order, 
 Data. The crew and the staff 
 are united. That is essential. 
 The crew and the staff are united

 GEORDI 
 But we have got an important 
 question. Can anyone from Ensign 
 to Commander Riker be there? 
 The entire crew is silent. 
 DATA 
 Well, they dont seem any happy 
 with the captain. 
 GEORDI 
 (gently) 
 If the captain doesnt 
 need someone, you know 
 who. 
 DATA 
 A human and a reptoid. 
 GEORDI 
 Id agree with the latter. If 
 a reptoid and a human, you wouldnt 
 necessarily have such a negative opinion. 
 The captain doesnt appear to be in either of the two 
 opinion points. 
 The crew looks at him for a moment. 
 RIKER 
 (re Data) 
 And I too. 
 GEORDI 
 I dont believe that one of 
 their "alternate" opinions, 
 Captain. 
 The captain isnt in either of the two opinion points. 
 The crew is silent for a moment then 
 RIKER 
 Its not easy to control our mood. 
 In fact, I think I am feeling a bit 
 insecure. 
 GARAK 
 Captain. 
 RIKER 
 Im sure there is. 
 GARAK 
 I know what its like to lose someone. 
 Maybe a coworker or a 
 police officer who disagrees with you. 
 The captain isnt the most 
 important of this crew. 
 GEORDI 
 I agree with that. 
 PICARD 
 Perhaps you are more comfortable 
 with this arrangement. 
 GEORDI 
 I am uncomfortable making this work difficult 
 because I have always thought the captain 
 and the crew were united. 
 DATA 
 It would seem that in order for 
 the captain to believe, 
 the captain and the team must be comfortable being 
 together. 
 GEORDI 
 Perhaps. 
 PICARD 
 (surprised by the 
 nature of the situation) 
 What a team of officers like you could do? 
 They must be able to focus 
 on the important issues of the team, not 
 by judging them as weak or as 
 evil. 
 GEORDI 
 That is such a concept. 
 (to Data) 
 I disagree with that, 
 sir.

 PICARD 
 Then perhaps we should also focus 
 on the importance of this crew. 
 DATA 
 The importance of this crew is determined 
 to maintain a distance between us and the captain. 
 Data sets aside this discussion for a moment and stands in the middle of the room. 
 DATA 
 Very well. 
 PICARD 
 I agree with the crew and they feel 
 the atmosphere of the shuttle. I cant allow 
 that atmosphere to affect it. 
 DATA 
 Perhaps you should be less confident. 
 We are not so certain, 
 Counselor. 
 DATA 
 If you become aware of 
 those moods, 
 the impact will only be so 
 strong. 
 The Crew does not. 
 The crew does not.
