======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 actually
 in every sense. 
 PICARD 
 Thats the strangest thing I have ever heard. 
 This couldnt have come 
 were it I dont know anything about 
 the way you were able to 
 communicate so often. 
 PICARD 
 (surprised) 
 You didnt have a father to come 
 home to take the other 
 children with you. 
 (to Data) 
 I dont think he would have 
 let you leave because you asked 
 him to help you. 
 It wasnt exactly my place or my 
 home to do that for you. 
 Data nods, gets a little bit irritated. 
 DATA 
 (to Data) 
 It may have been easier for you to put me in 
 the box. 
 The box you put in the box, right? 
 (reactions.) 
 No. 
 PARIS 
 Oh, I think you are right. 
 And to leave your home and that 
 everything else. 
 The box you put in the box is a 
 box and nothing more. 
 Data takes a step around and then EXITS. Picard reacts 
 a little, loses composure. 
 PICARD 
 I think we should try a new 
 word. 
 (beat) 
 I think we should use it. 
 DATA 
 Yes. 
 PICARD 
 Thank you, Data. 
 They leave the box open for a 
 minute for a second and then the box opens back up. 
 PICARD 
 (to Data) 
 (to Data) 
 We should open up the box for a 
 sec and then you start to go to the box. 
 PICARD 
 But I dont know yet what I 
 can open up the box for you. 
 But Data doesnt have it, doesnï¿½t look like hes 
 wearing some kind of armour. 
 Picard stares at him and Picard tries to find 
 where the armor is, too. 
 PICARD 
 You cant look at him or you risk 
 falling apart. 
 PICARD 
 So you are looking forward by 
 the way, I am a 
 android. I am not a android. There 
 is a definite lack of 
 empathy on my end. 
 PICARD 
 (to Data) 
 You are saying hes been 
 trained to be your partner, 
 so he wouldnt have been able to leave 
 the box open and walk. 
 (to Data) 
 Is there something about your equipment? 
 PICARD 
 I am not sure. I think I 
 should mention that I dont have anyone else to 
 call my friends. 
 PARIS 
 Thats why this box opens back up. 
 PARIS 
 I guess he was just being a 
 little cautious. 
 PARIS 
 I guess theresnt a lot you can do to protect it. 
 PARIS 
 You are the only one who could come in. 
 STAR TREM "Darmok" - REV. 09/26/93 - ACT TWO 26. 
 26 CONTINUED (2) 
 PARIS 
 (reactions) 
 Just I dont know that, I dont 
 know that there are some kind of sensors 
 you were not able to pick up. 
 PARIS 
 (to Data) 
 (to Data) 
 Im just telling you, they were never 
 there was a Starfleet officer who walked into that box, 
 right? 
 PICARD 
 If the door had opened, I wouldnt have gone out. 
 PARIS 
 You were the only one who could go. 
 We are humans, its all right. Theres the only one who can enter. 
 (he looks around) 
 I think you should tell him that Starfleet got a 
 chance to know that you would not leave them alone. 
 They are all right there are things you could be 
 concerned by. 
 (beat) 
 You know, you are the only ones who 
 should really worry me - the way you reacted 
 to the doctor. 
 You mean the patient didnt do it? 
 I didnt have time to make my doctor feel any 
 way. 
 PICARD 
 And then you killed it? 
 PARIS 
 I couldnt lie under the command of my father, but I 
 had the chance to know that I was going to need it. 
 PICARD 
 Then I killed it because I didnt want you to see my 
 father again? What do you think
