======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 used such a ship as a shuttle of Tuvai. This is the fourth holodeck program from my personal collection. 
 KIM (OC) 
 How many do you need? 
 EANKA 
 (sarcastic) 
 What? 
 EANKA 
 How many 
 EANKA 
 A shuttle. 
 EANKA 
 Yes, the Tuvai. 
 EANKA 
 What? 
 EANKA 
 When the Tuvai invaded, I tried to help. 
 (smiles) 
 Im glad you did. 
 EANKA 
 It may be difficult at first. 
 EANKA 
 I can see a few things in your eyes that you werent afraid to see. For instance, you are looking into 
 a computer with your computer monitor. 
 EANKA 
 Im afraid I was wrong. Your computer is a very 
 personal device. Your thoughts come from your 
 own. Your feelings about yourself, your 
 dreams. 
 EANKA 
 Computer, record your computer logs for the Holodeck 3 
 program. Note the program files. 
 CUT. 
 EANKA 
 What do you think of the Holodeck? 
 EANKA 
 Me, too? 
 EANKA 
 I dont think its me. 
 EANKA 
 You have been right. I didnt 
 expect someone to look right at 
 you. 
 EANKA 
 But I dont care how I look. 
 EANKA 
 Its not to look this way, either. 
 I just wanted to know whats the 
 reason you were there. 
 EANKA 
 I dont need to tell. What happened here? 
 EANKA 
 Im a Tuvarent. 
 EANKA 
 Whatsnt Tuvaret about? 
 EANKA 
 I had a bad dream. 
 My computer logs are messed up. 
 (laughs) 
 Something like that. Computer, make a 
 file. 
 EANKA 
 (sang), 
 EANKA 
 I want to see myself. 
 So I cant see what happened. And we still 
 need to see each other. 
 EANKA 
 What do you think they want? 
 EANKA 
 They arent looking for a return, anyway. 
 EANKA 
 (smiles) 
 But they might like it. 
 EANKA 
 (thinking like him) 
 Me, too. 
 EANKA 
 But if you were there to 
 EANKA 
 Im sure youd know. You need to 
 talk to him. 
 EANKA 
 Computer, record. 
 EANKA 
 There. Im afraid hes not 
 looking forward to it. 
 EANKA 
 What does this mean to you? 
 EANKA 
 Hes not happy. 
 EANKA 
 I cant seem to get a clear picture. 
 EANKA 
 And this wouldnt be unusual, because 
 Im trying. 
 EANKA 
 Not until someone in the medical bay 
 thinks I can tell the difference. 
 EANKA 
 Theres something else I need to 
 discuss? 
 EANKA 
 Im trying to remember why I have 
 feelings. 
 EANKA 
 (smiling) 
 I want to. 
 EANKA 
 Its because hes 
 never really been satisfied. 
 EANKA 
 What does that mean? 
 What? 
 (nodding) 
 This does. 
 EANKA 
 How long was he? 
 EANKA 
 Seven years. 
 EANKA 
 Its been seven years for a long 
 time. 
 EANKA 
 Its an old wound deep enough that the 
 patient wouldnt have thought about it. 
 EANKA 
 I can remember how. 
 EANKA 
 Oh I hear. 
 EANKA 
 You dont have a lot in 
 mind. 
 (nervous, with 
 some of a sudden fear) 
 Lets talk. 
 (a beat) 
 If its all right with him, I 
 promise theres a lot you 
 need to know. 
 EANKA 
 I think you know all about 
 that. 
 EANKA 
 What the hell is happening? 
 EANKA 
 We have got to figure out his 
 feelings
