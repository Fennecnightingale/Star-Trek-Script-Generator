 chose the 
 two months ago, 
 I gave you the command and control 
 of this station. 
 NOG 
 Well, you havent done a job, 
 has she. And in a few weeks, she will lead the 
 Dominion and put an end to these 
 occupation movements.

 NOG 
 (to his mother) 
 I dont believe Dax would be surprised 
 if she were here for a victory by the 
 Dominion. 
 NOG 
 (beat) 
 I see why you are worried about this 
 situation. 
 (beat) 
 Shes a good woman, and she is a great 
 person.

 TALIK 
 Thats what you care to say. 
 NOG 
 (firm) 
 Not that Im here. She is here. You cant stop her. 
 You cant help but respect her. 
 I dont want you to go down here 
 and pretend to love her before I do 
 it - because she is my daughter. Isnt 
 that what you are supposed to tell? 
 (a beat) 
 I can. She is my daughter. And I need her. 
 TALIK 
 (surprised) 
 It would be nice to hear you say that out loud, 
 Dax. 
 (beat) 
 But Im here and my daughter. I need Dax 
 right now. I need Dax now. 
 PICARD COM VOICE 
 Acknowledge. 
 18 INTERIOR INTERIOR QUARK QUARTERS 
 QUARK 
 Now you have got to say it. 
 QUARK 
 (to himself, shakes his head) 
 I see, there 
 is a certain pride in what you 
 have here. 
 QUARK 
 Theres not much to be proud 
 about. In fact, when the 
 Dominion comes in the north, 
 you will have to be ready to let the 
 people know. 
 QUARK 
 (wry) 
 How can I not? 
 QUARK 
 We will have to discuss it. 
 Quark has looked at his 
 daughter. Quark thinks about this for a moment, then 
 EXITS. 
 KAK 
 Quark. 
 QUARK 
 Its not that nice to leave a 
 woman 
 QUARK 
 (to Quark) 
 You cant leave a woman like this. 
 QUARK 
 I will leave, I will leave 
 QUARK 
 The problem is Im not a monster. 
 QUARK 
 She could not be more than a 
 woman I have never met. You need me 
 to find a new wife. 
 QUARK 
 Im not the only monster 
 in this galaxy, any species 
 or a monster 
 Quark reacts, surprised. 
 QUARK 
 We would be best as ever if we got a new 
 wife. When I first came to this 
 planet, Id have a chance at that 
 planet. Where the hell do you suppose 
 that woman could have taken her? 
 QUARK 
 (to himself) 
 So you are right in the wrong 
 way to die? 
 QUARK 
 I dont know. I donâ€™t care. All I 
 care about is my daughter. (to Quark, with 
 an edge) 
 Quark and I can together find a better 
 home for her than I care about 
 right now. 
 QUARK (Contd) 
 Thats not such an option, Quark. 
 QUARK 
 You will have to take me there 
 and talk with me about that. 
 Quark gets up, EXITS. Quark starts to leave 
 QUARK 
 Well I dont think she would understand the 
 reason I was here. I was here a week ago, and 
 I was here a fortnight ago. 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Dax" - REV. 02/23/96 - ACT TWO 24C.

 QUARK 
 (to Quark) 
 Dax has something in common with Quark. 
 Quark thinks he is right. 
 QUARK 
 No. I wont do that.
