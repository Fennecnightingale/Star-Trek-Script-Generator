 last one with some of my own. 
 But now its a chance worth 
 taking and I cant take it at 
 mine own hand. 
 Theres no way to get home. 
 But theres no way to get out. 
 Theres no way back. Theres no escape. 
 I will have the only way back. 
 I have to take the risk. 
 To take the risk. 
 Now if Im not wrong, I have spent more time away from her, 
 with more eyes out for her, but 
 I washes the 
 memories of her every time I got here on the Bridge of 
 Kahless, no matter how I feel. Im 
 able to remember what she looked like, the 
 people who looked like her, and the way shes acted. 
 In her memories she would know the way 
 to speak and act. 
 But now I have to take sides, and there 
 is no side. 
 Tuv and her husband are dead. How could Im in control of this? 
 Tuv? 
 How? 
 We have only got the one. 
 Tuv, my mother, my little sister, and my 
 brother, but theres no 
 family. 
 Tuv, my father. 
 Tuv. My brother. 
 Tuv. 
 Tuv. 
 Tuv, my sister. 
 Tuv. 
 Tuv. 
 Tuv, my brother. 
 Tuv, no you have. 
 
 Tuv, my sister. 
 PICARD ANCIENT HOLD - MORNING (OPTICAL) 
 PICARD ANCIENT HOLD - MORNING (OPTICAL), ACT TWO 23. 
 Picard is seated on a bench. PICARD 
 stands - he has no bench to 
 protect. He crosses to the bench. 
 PICARD 
 I dont know, Commander. I dont know. The 
res no bench for me. 
 He sees Picard sitting there - with no bench to protect 
 his entire self-image - in a way that he 
 understands. 
 PICARD 
 No? 
 PICARDS ANCIENT HOLD - MORNING (OPTICAL) 
 (PICARD is playing darts on the ground.) 
 PICARD 
 Come. 
 PICARD 
 (reluctant) 
 Come. 
 Picard starts playing darts - 
 PICARD 
 Where are you going? 
 Picard heads for the bench, his eyes on Picard. 
 PICARD 
 I think we need to get 
 out here. 
 (a beat) 
 I suppose Commander Riker has got a 
 point to make. 
 PICARD 
 You dont have one. 
 PICARD 
 Commander, no doubt. But the best way 
 to save lives is to take the risk. 
 And this problem is one for you, Commander. You 
 are the best people in the galaxy, 
 the brightest people in the quadrant. 
 PICARD 
 Are you sure? 
 PICARD 
 I assure you that you are. You are the only way 
 we will get home - and now you are the best people in the galaxy. 
 PICARD 
 I didnt mean to call my sister a child. I 
 meant to say "the best" or "the best". 
 Its the only way, PICARD 
 She knows her. She knows her. She knows 
 PICARD 
 Well, Im glad - you dont know her. 
 PICARD 
 I knew she. 
 PICARD 
 (overriding) 
 Im sorry. That kind of conversation is over. 
 Picard is not the best human, he knows that. He knows that the only 
 way out is to be human. 
 PICARD 
 I didnt want to be human. 
 PICARD 
 Myself, Im not human, 
 Im not. Now I know there 
 is a human and someone who knows me, 
 as much as anyone. 
 But if he has to say it - he knows his name, knows 
 that hes not human. That he can speak to his sister - 
 he knows that hes never gonna be human. He knows for sure. He knows. He knows what he is. And he knows that he can tell the rest of us - 
 that hes gonna speak to a new kind of self - something no one else knows. 
 (a beat) 
 He wants us to feel 
 good for him. But
