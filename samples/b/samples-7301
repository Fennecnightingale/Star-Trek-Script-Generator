 BASHIR 
 (continuing) 
 Captain, arent you forgetting? 
 OBRIEN 
 No, for not. 
 BASHIR 
 Oh, no, theres no forgetting. 
 BASHIR 
 (thinks) 
 Well? Well, maybe it will make 
 you smile. 
 OBRIEN 
 But I havent laughed a bit. 
 BASHIR 
 Actually, maybe its nothing. I can 
 tell you this ship took nine 
 trips before they 
 crashed on your starbase. 
 OBRIEN 
 We passed into the Dominion and 
 they sent the Enterprise here 
 to find a way to reach us.

 BASHIR

 OBRIEN

 BASHIR 
 So can I. So can I. So can you? 
 OBRIEN 
 I can. 
 BASHIR 
 So can I. So can you? 
 OBRIEN 
 We have a plan to destroy their 
 base. 
 BASHIR 
 Like that. 
 OBRIEN 
 Or we? 
 BASHIR 
 Well you can have mine. 
 OBRIEN 
 Well I have to try to cut here in 
 a hurry. 
 BASHIR 
 Hurry. 
 Bashir works to get up the chair, get ready 
 to leave, then pauses just so OBriens too 
 disappointed in him. 
 BASHIR 
 There will never be 
 forgiveness, Chief.

 OBRIEN 
 I guess it will be hard to 
 accept as the Dominion 
 invaded your galaxy. 
 BASHIR 
 So can it be better? 
 OBRIEN 
 Better? 
 BASHIR 
 (smiles) 
 Better than this. 
 OBRIEN 
 You have a plan? 
 BASHIR 
 Its just a matter of me getting 
 access to the library. 
 Off Odos reaction,

 Odos in b.g., looking out the 
 window 
 OBRIEN 
 (from his cell) 
 What would happen to us if he dies 
 to get rid of him ? 
 OBrien has no choice but to pretend he 
 knows no plan. 
 OBRIEN 
 I just couldnt agree more. 
 Off Odoks surprise

 the floor 
 OBRIEN 
 Bones put me through to the doctor 
 OBrien reacts to the pain 
 OBRIEN 
 Are you all right? 
 OBRIEN 
 Better than that melon- 
 acid messney. What happened? 
 OBRIEN 
 (examined) 
 I was thrown away by the 
 Anderson but Im all in 
 b.g. 
 B. A beat as the three of them look at each 
 other. 
 B.P. 
 I have been dreaming about something like 
 this for a long 
 time. 
 OBRIEN 
 What did Melon-Acons tell you about? 
 B.P. 
 (reacts) 
 A gang of killers. 
 OBRIEN 
 Which one? 
 B.P. 
 I will pass that on to the guards. 
 OBRIEN 
 The prisoner was not informed that 
 you were going to be placed 
 here. 
 OBRIEN 
 I just got word - you are going to 
 have to come with me. 
 B.P.s hands move 
 OBRIEN 
 Come on.
