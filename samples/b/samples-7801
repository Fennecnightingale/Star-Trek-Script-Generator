======== SAMPLE 1 ========

ARD 
 Mister Data, open a channel to 
 Captain Picard. Im a private 
 operator and unfamiliar with 
 these 
 telepathy devices. 
 DATA 
 Understood, sir. 
 Worf and his Romulan counterpart study each other 
 for a moment, then Picard moves to stand next to Datas 
 comrade. 
 WORF 
 Your Captain is astute, Captain. 
 PICARD 
 We have a very advanced technology 
 this. Its the power weapon I 
 have for bringing us all together. 
 Worf reacts to a computer terminal. 
 WORF 
 Access denied. 
 GEORDI COM VOICE 
 Worf, can you handle it? 
 WORF 
 I dont know, sir. 
 Picard and his Romulan counterpart, CALIEN, 
 is standing by. 
 PICARD 
 (to Picard) 
 Mister La Forge, open channel to 
 Captain. 
 GEORDI 
 (hits communicator) 
 Sir, there is a ship. 
 22 INTERIOR CORRIDOR 
 Picard and his Navigator are walking down it, a hooded cloak in 
 black robes, trying to look normal. 
 GEORDI 
 Captain, its unusual that none 
 of us understand it. 
 PICARD 
 It did not strike a nerve.

 GEORDI 
 Like hell, sir. 
 RIKER COM VOICE 
 Captain, its unusual to see Worf move 
 alone and not with someone 
 else. 
 PICARD 
 (gently) 
 We are being pursued by a Romulan 
 vessel. 
 GEORDI 
 Thats not a Romulan vessel, Riker. 
 It was designed to take advantage of our 
 position. 
 (beat) 
 This is Captain Picards 
 intention.

 RIKER 
 That gives us some time. You have a 
 question mark two. 
 GEORDI 
 (acknowledges) 
 Correct. We require the 
 sensors from our own ship to 
 help guide the helmsman. 
 PICARD 
 Without sensors, the ship would be 
 heading for a course back to 
 the planet. 
 (beat) 
 It would suggest that we 
 dont have much choice. 
 They EXIT into -

 23 INTERIOR TROI QUARTERS (OPTICAL) 
 TROI looks around with an intense feeling of 
 deja vu. She touches the computer terminal and picks up 
 a picture of her father. 
 TROI 
 Hello? 
 WORF 
 Hello, TRoI. 
 They sit around the room for a moment 
 STAR TREK "Liaisons" - 07/06/93 - ACT TWO 27. 
 23 CONTINUED 
 TROI 
 Its beautiful. 
 WORF 
 Yes 
 TROI 
 Id like to ask why. 
 WORF 
 You are a mother? 
 TROI 
 Yes. I believe people are 
 responsible for their physical 
 health and if they dont 
 they might get to what it 
 comes to be. 
 WORF 
 What kind of protection do Romulan 
 children have? 
 TROI 
 (sighs, "humiliating" 
 gives away 
 understanding) 
 Its simple. A mother takes the responsibility of 
 her husband. I do not share that 
 sentiment. 
 WORF 
 Then maybe you would like to learn a 
 thing or two about yourself. 
 TROI 
 I was doing a research. 
 WORF 
 You have done a complete examination. 
 STAR TREK "Liaisons" - 07/06/93 - ACT TWO 28.

 TROI 
 But I am not a mother. 
 WORF 
 I am an android. 
 TROI 
 A computer. A holographic 
 image. 
 WORF 
 What does that have to do with 
 me? 
 TROI 
 Not that it matters. 
 WORF 
 Why is that? 
 TROI 
 You are
