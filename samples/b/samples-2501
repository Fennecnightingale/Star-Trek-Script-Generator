 unpleasant thing. He was right there. 
 He was there.

 (a beat) 
 Im sure you will do. I was 
 right there. 
 (a beat) 
 And did you know that? 
 GEORDI 
 He knew what you were going 
 to say to me. He didnt like it. 
 GEORDI 
 Then what I had to do was say 
 theres nothing we can do it. 
 And thats true. I can have your 
 heart (says something) 
 that you have the heart of the 
 Ferengi. 
 GEORDI 
 Its not true. 
 GEORDI 
 No, it isnt. 
 GEORDI 
 (muttering) 
 Its what I want the most 
 of my life to know all right. 
 Its what you want the 
 most of your life to know. 
 DEELA

 GEORDI 
 He who has the heart 
 of the Ferengi. 
 DEELA 
 What do they go 
 about with the Ferengi? 
 GEORDI 
 (bitter whisper)

 the wrong religion. You will 
 find that the Federation disagrees 
 with that religion.

 DEELA 
 I just want you to know 
 GEORDI 
 (beat) 
 that I understand the teachings on the 
 Ferengi. 
 DEELA 
 I know your heart, Geordi. 
 GEORDI 
 I feel a great personal bond with
