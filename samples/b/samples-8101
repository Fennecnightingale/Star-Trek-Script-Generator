ER 
 (continuing) 
 My nephew Rom. He was 
 going to be here an 
 hour ago. 
 ZIYAL 
 Did he say anything to 
 you? 
 DEEP SPACE "The Passenger" - 11/25/92 - ACT TWO 24. 
 42 CONTINUED (2) 
 OBRIEN 
 No. He just made a mistake. 
 ZIYAL 
 (puzzled) 
 It sounds like a man who has made a 
 mistake. 
 OBRIEN 
 If that happens again, I want 
 to see him now. 
 ZIYAL 
 If theres anything, I want you to 
 know it. Right now I want you to 
 help me track him as 
 well. 
 OBrien raises and moves away, the crewmen behind him starting to 
 leave. 
 ZIYAL 
 (continuing) 
 I owe you that, Uncle. 
 OBRIEN 
 (not happy) 
 I can track him, using a 
 repliant. 
 DEEP SPACE "The Passenger" - 11/25/92 - ACT TWO 24A. 
 42 CONTINUED (3) 
 (finishing his task) 
 I can help you get your people 
 all transported up to the Dome. 
 ZIYAL 
 (disagreed) 
 All transported up to the Dome? 
 If they are all dead, the 
 Federation will be destroyed. 
 And as the crew returns to the shuttle 
 EXITS. 
 43 INTERIOR SECURITY OFFICE 
 Kira ENTERS Odos office. 
 KIRA 
 You wanted to see me, Constable. 
 DEEP SPACE "The Passenger" - 11/25/92 - ACT TWO 25. 
 43 CONTINUED 
 KIRA 
 (off his look) 
 I already did. Its urgent that 
 the Defiant undergoes a 
 thorough post-warp check. 
 ODO 
 Why? 
 KIRA 
 We have a good deal of dilithium 
 crystals they need. 
 ODO 
 (showed) 
 Of course. 
 KIRA 
 You said that on your ship? 
 ODO 
 Of course. 
 Kira looks at him. 
 DEEP SPACE "The Passenger" - 11/25/92 - ACT TWO 26. 
 43 CONTINUED (2) 
 KIRA 
 You mean you are not going to use it? 
 ODO 
 Dont worry about that. Why dont you 
 use the universal translator and just 
 speak the language. 
 KIRA 
 This isnt helping. I think 
 your people are on the 
 brink of creating a new life for 
 themselves. The people need to be 
 focused on their job. All I can 
 do is watch them construct their 
 weapons systems. 
 Odo looks away, his face hidden from view. 
 ODO 
 I can stop them from 
 killing me or from doing what you 
 think is best. Im sure 
 you can. 
 And with that, Kira turns and heads for the door. Odo 
 takes a long beat, then looks back at Kira. After a beat, 
 ODO 
 I want you to pay a visit to 
 Vantikon Argus Three. I think 
 your ships in fair shape. 
 DEEP SPACE "The Passenger" - 11/25/92 - ACT TWO 27. 
 43 CONTINUED (3) 
 KIRA 
 Excellent. 
 ODO 
 You even know how to fly that 
 thing. 
 KIRA 
 You. Me? 
 ODO 
 I Want to take a closer look at this 
 Odo nods. Kira EXITS. Odo continues to WORK as he gets out of 
 his office. Kira approaches. 
 KIRA 
 (in a different position than 
 "personage"). 
 Once you complete the tests of 
 the Cardassian you will want to 
 see what you are done. 
 DEEP SPACE "The Passenger" - 11/25/92 - ACT TWO 28. 
 43 CONTINUED (4) 
 ODO 
 I will make that case. 
 And he heads for the door. As the guards 
 get up again , 
 44 CLOSE - THE REST OF THE SHAPER 
 As Kira looks back. 
 KIRA 
 You are different than I expected.
