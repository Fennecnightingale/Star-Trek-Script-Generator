VEN 
 Captain Picard. 
 He 
 (beat) 
 has been on the Bridge. 
 Odo gives him a cold glare. 
 ODO 
 (to the viewscreens) 
 What if he wants to leave Starfleet 
 again? 
 PICARD 
 Perhaps he will forget that 
 on seeing 
 (holds) 
 what hes seen. I have to 
 tell you, he didnt do anything 
 that was dangerous. 
 Odo does an equally hard 
 look. 
 Odo turns to the turbolift 
 PICARD 
 Hold on the Viewscreen 
 Odo is back into the turbolift 
 PICARD 
 Captain! 
 Odo steps into turbolift 
 ODO

 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 Lieutenant 
 (a beat as he 
 tries to explain) 
 We are taking a shuttle 
 trip. 
 On the viewscreens 
 BADD-ADER 
 I dont know whats up, 
 I dont know. 
 PICARD 
 Im on my way to your 
 cell to get you to your 
 cell 
 BADD-ADER 
 (to Odo) 
 I don’t care. 
 ON ODO/PICARD (OPTICAL) 
 Odo is about to leave. 
 ODO 
 I havent been there 
 in weeks 
 BADD-ADER 
 I don’t care. You’re all 
 going back to your cells. 
 OBRIEN COM VOICE 
 I am sorry to see you are 
 suffering out of the spirit. 
 PICARD 
 (a quick flash) 
 Im sure you’re all going 
 about your business having 
 a fine time. 
 She looks to Odo 
 OBRIEN COM VOICE 
 I have to see you, Odo.

 DEEP SPACE OQ (PART TWO

 Odo, Bashir and Leitat are sitting around a table, all of 
 the players having drinks on hand 
 BASHIR

 Odo doesnt have any friends. 
 ODO 
 (to Bashir) 
 We should meet up a good 
 time at Odos Bar 
 BASHIR 
 So you mean, come and

 BASHIR 
 What do you mean? 
 Odo doesnt have any friends 
 ODO 
 (to Odo) 
 If they havent put in a 
 good word for you, I suggest you 
 Odo hasnt put in any 
 word either 
 ODO 
 I dont suppose I can help you find 
 any kind of good. 
 Odo takes a deep breath 
 ODO 
 Its not easy to take the other way 
 around 
 Odo tries to put on a good face 
 ODO 
 There’s nothing easy about 
 being an easy guy 
 
 Odo, he could be hard to get 
 to talk to. 
 Odo and the others exchange a look 
 ODO 
 How can you deny 
 a friendship we all 
 have 
 Odo and Leitat are at first, but then 
 ON Odo 
 Odo, Leitat and PICARD 
 They are a trio 
 ODO 
 (to the others) 
 They are a trio 
 Odo sees the problem 
 Odo 
 (to Bashir) 
 I will say one thing about 
 them is that their 
 numbers are inflated 
 Odo and Leitat turn their 
 attention to Odo 
 Odo and Leitat 
 BASHIR 
 Odo hasnt seen any of them

 BASHIR 
 (to them. 
 Odo) 
 Hes coming. 
 Odo has to turn to Bashir 
 ODO 
 Is he even coming? 
 BASHIR 
 Odo cant be I dont even think 
 hes gonna 
 ODO 
 (re Odo) 
 Im a betting odds man 
 BASHir is a little more 
 confident to see him 
 BASHIR 
 (to the others) 
 Hold on the two of them.
