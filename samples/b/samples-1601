======== SAMPLE 1 ========

 
 ODO 
 Do you have any idea what a 
 transporter might accomplish? 
 LORA 
 I have studied several models of 
 transporter replicators that I have 
 observed as successful with the 
 technology as yours. 
 DEEP SPACE "Odo " - REV. 08/15/93 - ACT TWO 18A. 
 14 CONTINUED (2) 
 ODO 
 We are the best model in the 
 world - our technology is second 
 to yours. 
 LORA 
 We wouldnt be so good with 
 the transporter. 
 ODO 
 Thats good. 
 LORA 
 The only one of your group that 
 can 
 ODO 
 Why? Is it because 
 LORA 
 This is a new technology 
 ODO 
 It was invented by 
 the people behind the bar. 
 (as they look at the 
 mirror) 
 I will take you a look - see to the 
 transporter work 
 LORA 
 We can do it 
 ODO 
 (indicates mirror) 
 Just one of our technology 
 LORA 
 We have been experimenting with 
 the same kind of technology 
 for centuries we only 
 had a few years to catch 
 up 
 ODO 
 You were a transporter model at 
 your university 
 LORA 
 I have a friend on this station. 
 I will see what I can do. 
 A beat as Odo hands it to Loran, who is standing over 
 the window looking at a PADD for a moment. 
 ODO 
 Do it. 
 LORA 
 (smiles) 
 You did make the perfect choice 
 for your mission. 
 LORA 
 That was very fortunate, 
 to be so close 
 (to mirror) 
 What do you think it will do? 
 ODO 
 Its a transporter 
 LORA 
 What about the mirror? 
 ODO 
 The mirror is built into 
 every ship 
 LORA 
 What about that? 
 ODO 
 The mirror is made up of a 
 transporter component 
 LORA 
 (surprised) 
 You must think it worked on 
 something? 
 ODO 
 I have been looking at 
 some new technology 
 She moves to look to the mirror 
 (quickly) 
 The warp field 
 created by this 
 system 
 DEEP SPACE "Odo " - REV. 08/23/93 - ACT TWO 19A. 
 14 CONTINUED (3) 
 LORA 
 Its a warp control 
 matrix 
 She sees the mirror has been moved toward a 
 wall panel. Odo reaches in to remove the mirror 
 ODO 
 Get the refractory to the main panel 
 LORA 
 (re mirror) 
 The secondary 
 Odo moves the mirror to a wall panel. 
 She moves the mirror toward a wall wall panel 
 LORA 
 I will run the auxiliary 
 system 
 Odo takes the mirror and starts to walk it 
 over to Loran. 
 LEADER 
 Youd better go 
 She moves to the wall panel which 
 has been moved toward the wall with other mirror 
 replacements 
 LORA 
 (continuing) 
 I will go see your 
 system 
 Leads and goes off as Loran moves to where 
 the mirror was laid down 
 LORA 
 (continuing) 
 I want to put in a new 
 one 
 (re mirror) 
 But what about my other 
 replacement? 
 LEADER 
 You had your chance. 
 LORA 
 (continuing, 
 as they leave) 
 You were in the mirror 
 LEADER 
 In the mirror? 
 LORA 
 We made a different variant. 
 LEADER 
 Yes 
 (trying to reach the mirror off 
 the wall) 
 You have got your work cut out for you. 
 Leads quickly and he takes a few seconds - and 
 off this disturbing thought 
 CUT TO 
 15 EXTERIOR SPACE - DEEP SPACE NOR (OPTICAL) 
 in orbit just as before. 
 16 INTERIOR LOREY - LIVE IN ON LOREY, WIDE ON the mirror; a LOREY, LATERIAL and 
 distant, she seems comfortable at the mirror,
