======== SAMPLE 1 ========
. 
 We have been ordered to cross into 
 Lysian territory 
 (pointing) 
 and destroy their Central 
 Command. 
 OBRIEN 
 We are coming for a battle, 
 a battle which we dont want 
 to involve. But theres 
 been a great deal of loss. 
 RUSSOM 
 And theres still time. 
 OBRIEN 
 And if the Ferengi forces us to go 
 on our own 
 RUSSOM 
 I dont have the chance to argue that 
 because the Federation forces in 
 the Imperial Guard just retitled your 
 old head of operations. 
 OBRIEN 
 The Ferengi probably told you all this. 
 RUSSOM 
 The best way of making that sacrifice has 
 allowed us all our long careers 
 (beat) 
 And I suppose we will make it. 
 OBRIEN 
 All right, lets do it. 
 RUSSOM 
 If not, with luck Id say, in the end, for a 
 long time. 
 OBRIEN 
 (sotto) 
 We are not going to need all our 
 guns. Just one more 
 word for that. 
 RASMUSSOM 
 We wont talk about this. 
 OBRIEN 
 All right. 
 RUSSOM 
 So, this meeting is over. 
 RUSSOM 
 Meet me in the transporter alcove. 
 OBRIEN 
 (sotto) 
 Ress, come with me.

 WAVENS enveloping the area, buzzing about 
 in the air, churning it like a whirlwind. 
 Shes wearing a huge cloak that covers her arms. 
 Geordi and Wesley look around the room. 
 WESLEY 
 (re the tricorder) 
 What a surprise 
 WAVENS 
 (re tricorder) 
 Its a Ferengi trick named Takana. I 
 dont think 
 GEORDI 
 (sotto) 
 Sakkaran tea 
 WESLEY 
 I think I got it. 
 WAVENS 
 Its been a real big hit. 
 Wesley runs to a computer panel on the wall. 
 WESLEY 
 What ? 
 WAVENS 
 (to com) 
 Do you want me to go to your 
 quarters? 
 WESLEY 
 (as if in a trance) 
 Say yes. 
 WAVENS 
 I will come with you. 
 WESLEY 
 (softening) 
 Thats all I hope for.

 WAVENS 
 Its only a little water 
 RIKER 
 It will get real soon enough. 
 Worf walks through the shadows, comes closer to the entrance. 
 WAVENS 
 Your quarters will probably take care 
 of it. 
 RIKER 
 I will take care of it. 
 Worf enters the tiny chamber hes been in for a 
 moment. He touches the chamber, which has a wooden 
 furniture. He is between a rock and a flower. 
 WORF 
 (continuing) 
 And also because my people 
 are sensitive 
 RIKER 
 (off the tricorder) 
 Are you sure these plants cant 
 replicate tricorder? 
 WORF 
 Certainly not. 
 RIKER 
 (quickly) 
 Thats it? 
 Worf reaches inside and pulls out a vial. 
 WORF 
 The Andorian Agricultural Ministry 
 "adopted" my brother and sealed his 
 mouth 
 (beat) 
 and taught him to be 
 precise in pronouncing 
 it. 
 RIKER 
 I will have to study the body. 
 WORF 
 And he? 
 RIKER 
 And you really ought to study 
 the technique. 
 WORF 
 You cant help to think like 
 this. 
 (beat) 
 It does not make sense.
