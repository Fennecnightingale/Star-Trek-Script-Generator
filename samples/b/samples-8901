======== SAMPLE 1 ========

, who else is in charge? 
 ODO 
 Most of Bajorans are. 
 KIRA 
 We are a long shot. But I want to 
 know who they are talking to here. 
 OBRIEN 
 A lot of them. We need to 
 know who they are planning to 
 hire. 
 KIRA 
 A lot of them. Who is 
 they? 
 Odo doesnt answer, and he seems to be listening. 
 WORF 
 They are mercenaries. They are just 
 trying to get information. 
 KIRA 
 If we could get more information, 
 the rebels could start working towards 
 capturing your people. 
 WORF 
 What would happen to them? 
 KIRA 
 Id be hoping they didnt hire 
 mercenaries.

 13 INTERIOR JAKE HOUSE - MINUTES LATERNITY 
 With a flash of anger, Jake hit the button on the door, 
 which caused the door CHIMES. 
 JAKE 
 Come in. 
 SELBETH 
 We were just talking about the minefield. 
 Jakes head snaps open. 
 JAKE 
 Did you ever do anything you really 
 want me to do something you dont want me to do 
 yet, do you ever say anything 
 anything you could think about 
 anything I could happen to you hurt me or something 
 would you ever do. 
 SELBETH 
 That was the first thing we did. 
 JAKE 
 The first thing we did is build a trust. We were 
 in the middle of a war and you 
 couldnt give us the better way. 
 (a beat) 
 So we left the village 
 area with the three of our men, 
 then hid it from them until they 
 got here. 
 (a beat) 
 These were the first smart 
 decisions. 
 Sela is a thoughtful beat. 
 SELBETH 
 Are you really sure you want 
 to go through the wormhole? 
 JAKE 
 We have been there three times 
 and I can honestly say they were 
 always going to pull me out of the 
 gravity well before the 
 gravity field. So they put me in the 
 ground 
 SELBETH 
 They could use their gravity 
 field for dejected 
 energy. 
 JAKE 
 Theres no reason they would need 
 so. 
 SELBETH 
 Theres a possibility they are 
 not going to need it.

 13 CONTINUED 
 SELBETH 
 Maybe they are not the most 
 genetically inclined. 
 She is about to reach for one of his head wounds. 
 SELBETH 
 If we can regain control, 
 the damage will be to their head 
 pain, their brain damage, their 
 children, their families. 
 They are desperately trying to reach out to each 
 other. 
 JAKE 
 I can get them out of this, can I? 
 SELBETH 
 Its going to be a while. 
 They need to regain control 
 now. 
 He reaches a last nerve pinch, then makes a go for it 
 he crushes back the strap and pulls himself free.

 14 EXTERIOR JUNGLE - DAWN 
 Jake and Nog are walking through the jungle as Jake and Nog watch. 
 JAKE 
 I have never seen a mouse-sized animal 
 and I wish I could help you. 
 NOG 
 That must be difficult. 
 JAKE 
 If you are not feeling well enough, 
 I will take the pain off the flute 
 Jake moves to help her and between them, they physically 
 pry the doors apart and the air is more volulent. 
 JAKE 
 If we can
