======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 You. 
 KEL 
 Why? 
 MELANDA 
 (quickly) 
 Because it’s true. 
 (beat) 
 That’s how we know. 
 KAL 
 So it’s true. 
 MELANDA 
 Are you mad at me? 
 KEL 
 No, please, dont you have a 
 better idea? 
 MELANDA 
 Why should I be? I’ve got to tell 
 you, we don’t know this is what it 
 says! 
 KAL 
 We have never. 
 MELANDA 
 And we don’t. Now I’ll leave. 
 KEL 
 It’s my leave. 
 The door opens and Quark enters, followed by a 
 determined expression. 
 QUARK 
 I was trapped here in the bar . 
 Were all of us really mad? 
 What’s going on 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Penumbra" - REV. 02/24/96 - ACT TWO 21. 
 24 CONTINUED 
 QUARK 
 There’s a reason I was 
 able to set up that hearing log on the 
 planet. It’s to see what God knows 
 about us. But it’s not true. 
 A beat. 
 QUARK 
 I set the hearing log here, because 
 you know exactly what God knows about us. 
 And even though he speaks with some 
 unusual candor, a passion for us 
 that says, "We only have one 
 and I’m not letting them know about it yet. 
 But that is the way things have always been. 
 And what are you so interested in? 
 QUARK 
 To see. 
 QUARK 
 And you are a holos. 
 QUARK 
 The holos? You are a holos. 
 QUARK 
 What? 
 QUARK 
 You are Morag, and you want me 
 to tell you about my secret. 
 QUARK 
 But I only want to know. 
 The door suddenly CHIMES. Quark immediately 
 motions to see Garak coming. 
 QUARK 
 GARAK! 
 GARAK 
 He came to the bar to say hi. 
 It takes a beat for Quark to realize she looks 
 like he was just talking to himself. 
 QUARK 
 Really? 
 GARAK 
 He came to me to tell me about 
 your new mission. 
 QUARK 
 But I never said it was important. 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Penumbra" - REV. 02/24/96 - ACT TWO 22. 
 24 CONTINUED (2) 
 GARAK 
 (dry) 
 I told you. 
 (beat) 
 After the mission. 
 QUARK 
 And then you come back with a 
 couple of hunchies. Im sure 
 you’d love to do that. 
 Garak pauses with a long look on his face 
 then looks out the window and thinks about what his 
 friends have seen. 
 GARAK 
 You never really know. 
 (beat) 
 Now I do know you have never been 
 able to tell us what you really are and 
 neither have I. I did it to 
 myself. 
 QUARK 
 So it matters. 
 GARAK 
 You never know how I’d react. 
 QUARK 
 I didn’t either. And now you know. 
 You’re here. Now I just threw 
 up a bad word. 
 GARAK 
 I’m sorry. 
 QUARK 
 But I’m sorry. You can go. 
 He EXITS and Quarks feeling a little 
 better for himself. 
 FADE OUT.
