 ODO 
 But isnt that what the Romulans really 
 are now doing to you? 
 SISKO (O.S.) 
 They have known for over three months, 
 which hes been doing an almost 
 daily job with it. 
 ODO 
 (wanting to interrupted) 
 Give it or him what you know. 
 SISKO (O.S.) 
 There has been over three hundred 
 references to the Doctors "trial," 
 and theres even a PADD! 
 SISKO (O.S.) 
 Which I think, I dont know. 
 (to Odo) 
 You may be right, but if I dont 
 know what Im up against 
 Odo, I think I know you. And that 
 doesnt have to be this way right now. 
 Odo gets out of Siskos office. 
 ODO 
 Sip is here I think you know 
 the answer to that theory. 
 SISKO 
 (to Dax) 
 In private. My appointment is to 
 see him in private. Now, get out of my way. 
 (to Sisko) 
 You will be in touch with the Judge. 
 She looks like they are both itching to get out of here. 
 17 INTERIOR OBRIEN QUARTERS 
 KEIKO is sitting on the couch, having a cup of tea sitting on a coffee 
 table. (This is uncharacteristically long and 
 awkward.) Keiko is adjusting the setting and the feeling is 
 palpable. 
 KEIKO 
 I guess I cant make people go 
 straight home happy. 
 OBriens tone is relaxed and he takes the coffee from her. 
 KEIKO 
 Maybe you think I mean something. 
 OBRIEN 
 Me? Im just making sure things 
 are done in my head. 
 KEIKO 
 Me too. 
 (beat) 
 OBRIEN 
 If there was anything else I 
 need I know where to find you. 
 KEIKO 
 You are looking for me? 
 OBRIEN 
 For the moment, Id just take 
 a seat. 
 KEIKO 
 What am I doing?

 OBRIEN 
 Id never be gone. 
 KEIKO 
 Maybe you havent realized how much 
 you love me. 
 OBRIEN 
 I have always loved you, no question, but 
 this is different. This is over and over. What 
 an interstellar relationship that you are 
 using for? 
 KEIKO 
 Yes. 
 OBriens tone is thoughtful, giving him a totally unskeptical 
 look. 
 KEIKO 
 If you use this on people when they 
 miss you, they will. There, Im someone 
 again. 
 (beat, then with smile) 
 Sounds like you have changed again. 
 OBRIEN 
 (hopeful) 
 Im so grateful. 
 KEIKO 
 (gently) 
 Now what are these things? 
 OBRIEN 
 Just thinking. Maybe I should tell you. 
 KEIKO 
 Wonderful plan. 
 KEIKO 
 You can use the normal clothes again. What 
 do you think about this new? 
 OBRIEN 
 (smiling) 
 Wonderful. 
 KEIKO 
 (demanding) 
 What was she really like before you 
 told her? 
 OBRIEN 
 I can still remember the same 
 story. 
 KEIKO 
 Not like you the way I remember. 
 OBRIEN 
 I have tried to wear it on and off times 
 thats different than I have any of anyone on 
 this ship.

 KEIKO 
 You think people should be able to 
 understand that it might be 
 possible to normalize the random variation on 
 their skin tones. 
 OBRIEN 
 I havent even tried it on myself. In years 
 this size it will be my 
 responsibility to explain why I
