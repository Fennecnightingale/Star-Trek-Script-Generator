======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 L. Odo is there to 
 greet her son as she steps over to pick a flower. 
 ODO 
 Good morning! 
 HOLD ON KIRA 
 Good morning! Its a lovely day! 
 ODO 
 You are a handsome woman, Hoshi. 
 I am Tofil, from the town of 
 Tornia. 
 HOLD INTORIOR TEMPLE THE CAPITAL CITY 
 Establishing. 
 The capital city is a big dome. 
 ODO 
 The reason I was unable 
 to give you room is you 
 have left town. 
 The ambassador nods, moves away into the distance. 
 HOLD INTORMAL AND HOSTILE 
 exchange a small salute. A procession of 
 high-tech girders and metal-lungs leads the way to an 
 enclave complex. From a vast distance, 
 a large cloud of starships is seen moving across 
 the cloud. 
 Its a vast cloud, obscen to daylight, though still 
 opaque from the ever-changing light. The cloud 
 appears to be mostly in the alpha 
 sky.

 28 INTERIOR EMPOK NOR - CARGO BAY 
 Odo and a handful of Alliance troops sit at the narrow 
 entrance to a wide building. 
 ODO 
 If you are in trouble, don 
 want a soldier with you. You 
 have much more important 
 security systems than he, do you? 
 The two guards move in to confine a 
 young woman, whom is in a terrible guard.

 28 CONTINUED 
 The two guards point to a small wall which encircle a 
 narrow opening. 
 29 INCLUDE AN INCOMPREYABLE MURDER 
 is standing at the entrance to the building, the 
 salveter of an invisible wall not visible beyond it. 
 ODO 
 I dont like this place. 
 The salveter in a blue-veined fence seems to be 
 the head of a huge Empire. 
 The salveter in a blue-veined fence seems to be an 
 amalgamation of several others. 
 (a beat) 
 But it is clear that theres a definite division 
 between the salveters and the rest of the compound. Its 
 odd this has been this complex 
 since we began. 
 HOSTILE 
 I do hope we will get the rest of 
 this place and so shall we. The reason we 
 hope is that all of this was 
 a trap for your empire. 
 ODO 
 Thats the basis for what it is. 
 HOSTILE 
 Of course, but we have also 
 reasons to justify their actions. Now 
 lets find out what those motivations are before 
 they become commonplace. 
 ODO 
 But we have to find out 
 how they exist. And how much 
 distance does this country? How 
 does it compare to the other 
 empire? 
 HOSTILE 
 I assure you its more similar 
 than we have ever had to set foot 
 outside the capital. For the good, 
 this place is as beautiful as 
 I remember it to be as beautiful as this 
 place is to me. 
 ODO 
 You said you have no memory of the 
 city. 
 HOSTILE 
 Of course you do. In fact, 
 it hasnt value. You see, theres 
 a good chance this place will lure you to it 
 and bring us some 
 (cossack) 
 food. Good food no good 
 you are going to have to taste it 
 immediately. Its 
 an aphrobiographical recipe. 
 HOSTILE 
 You have won me a lot better 
 this time. 
 ODO 
 Well Im hoping to win you 
 a little help. This place is 
 special to you. 
 HOSTILE 
 This place is even better 
 than this place any more easily can be 
 held back. 
 ODO 
 I hope you believe you can. 
 HOSTILE 
 So I have a friend here. Someone 
 like me. And theres 
 someone you have got in the background and 
 beside me to protect you. 
 ODO 
 Thats what I have found. 
 HOSTILE
