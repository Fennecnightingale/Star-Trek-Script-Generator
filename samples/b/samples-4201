 KIRK This is the Bridge, Scotty, from the Bridge. 
 SCOTT The Captain, do you ever drop by the turbolift, 
 sir? 
 (Kirk reaches for the turboling and puts it out.) 
 SCOTT If you drop by the turbolift, sir, he'll have a little luck in 
 the turbolift, helterding out a full power differential of ninety 
 percent, Jim? 
 (Bridge) 
 (Kirk finds himself on one side of the turbolift, so Kirk has to come with it.) 
 (Bridge) 
 SCOTT (OC) Captain, its Jim 
 KIRK Are you out? Spock, are you still on the same side of that 
 freighter? 
 SPOCK Quite as requested, Captain. 
 KIRK That ship is full of people. 
 (Bridge) 
 KIRK Which way do you go, Mister Spock? 
 SPOCK I wouldnt recommend it for that area, sir. I have got three people on that 
 surface going directly from side to side. 
 (There they go, and they face the ceiling) 
 (Briefing room) 
 MCCOY There can be no realisation of all this. 
 JANEWAY It may have something to do with the phaser drill. 
 MCCOY Its perfectly valid. 
 SPOCK Theoretically, Captain, the same would be true. But from the very nature of these 
 rocks, its clear they are made up of extremely weak, practically nonexistent 
 substances. As I have pointed out, their extremely low yields suggest they were made 
 to withstand some kind of crude natural process. 
 MCCOY Thats right, and thats rough. We have examined the ionisation 
 of the rocks, found the same materialization process 
 (to com panel) 
 CHEKOV Captain. 
 SCOTT There is something else going on, Captain. 
 (Bridge) 
 CHEKOV (OC) You wont answer, Scotty. Theres nothing on here about it that bothers you, 
 Lieutenant. All right, Captain, answer me. 
 Captains log, stardate 622.5. I have been sent to Command by Starfleet Command to 
 USS Enterprise by order of the starship Enterprise to take aboard the 
 crew of the USS Enterprise to our destination. 
 (Bridge) 
 CHEKOV Captain, there you are. Let me guess. You are Captain Kirk, arent 
 you? Kirk to Enterprise. Respond. Repeat please, please, answer 
 CHEKOV (OC) We have just received a distress call from the two of you aboard the turbolift. 
 (Sickbay) 
 (Spock and Chekov lie on bare tables, in pink to the floor.) 
 CHEKOV Captain Kirk, how low are you? 
 CHEKOV (OC) Thirty two percent. I have got barely enough time to pump an 
 away team down there right away, Chekov. 
 SPOCK Doctor, I am running out time. 
 CHEKOV Halfway through. 
 SPOCK Quite as requested. 
 CHEKOV Halfway through. 
 SPOCK I doubt he has a point, Commander. 
 CHEKOV I am too far away, Spock. 
 PULASKI Jim! 
 CHEKOV Look, I have checked all the life systems on this whole ship. Im sorry to waste time. 
 Spock, do you read me? Life support is down to seventy five percent. 
 Im not dropping to fifty five percent. 
 SPOCK Doctor? 
 CHEKOV You are dropping to fifty five percent. 
 SCOTT If we reactivate him, bring him along. 
 (Chekov is dragged out.) 
 CHEKOV You are away from the Bridge, Spock? 
 SPOCK If we reactivate him, we may be able to bring him back to Engineering. <|endoftext|>

 (Bridge) 
 KIRK How are I doing? 
 SPOCK I will need a minute. Lieutenant Uhura, relieve Engineering. 
 UHURA I will do it, sir. Good luck, Captain. 
 KIRK Kirk out. 
 (Engineering) 
 KIRK Kirk out, Spock? 
 SPOCK Ready, Captain. 
 KIRK Keep hold, Spock. Lieutenant Uhura, answer me. 
 SULU (OC) Engineering to Captain Kirk.
