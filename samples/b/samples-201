======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 T.
 (beat) 
 you know, 
 (beat) 
 it started when 
 the Tarkaleans invaded us, 
 (beat) 
 
 theres no time to go to the planet 
 to find 
 a ship that could outrun the Tarkale 
 forces, and then we all decided that 
 that meant we were going to 
 take the Enterprise for our own 
 use. 
 (beat) 
 and then we started 
 down the road to our own destruction 
 (beat) 
 when the crew decided to turn 
 that ship back to where it was 
 on the planet. 
 (beat) 
 when theres no opportunity for 
 any action? 
 (beat) 
 You have no choice, you can do nothing about 
 the Tarkale, you have 
 no choice but to give it back to them 
 at that moment. 
 (beat) 
 if the captain doesnt want to give them 
 the ship, I can make him do it. 
 (beat) 
 I can make him do it. 
 (beat) 
 I can make him do it. 
 (beat) 
 I can make him do it. 
 (beat) 
 He is not going to let you do that. 
 (beat) 
 And if you want to say I didn’t do anything 
 to stop them, tell me! 
 (beat) 
 He knows, we are all doing our job better than he thinks 
 He knows that you are looking at him in the 
 light and he thinks a moment, 
 then he looks at you again, turns to face the Tarkale. 
 RIKER 
 You want to say you didn’t do anything? 
 (beat, surprised) 
 Thats not easy for him. 
 (beat) 
 He thinks we are all on his level. 
 RIKER 
 You are right and he is right. 
 (beat) 
 If you think you’t better he will tell you right 
 now. 
 (beat) 
 You’t not want to fight him, do you’t want to try 
 to fight him? 
 (beat) 
 But he said you’t want 
 to try to convince him to do this. 
 So I’m going to have to accept 
 that. 
 And the Tarkale takes this in a low and decisive stride. 
 MCCOY 
 Id say he will tell you right. 
 (beat) 
 And when he talks about his decision 
 MCCOY 
 I’m glad he’d say the right things. 
 (beat) 
 There‽ an army of soldiers standing 
 here. 
 Tarkale 
 MCCOY 
 The Tarkale want to see you, they‗m going 
 to go 
 Tarkale 
 MCCOY 
 In the same way they‗ll go to war and 
 destroy each other. 
 Tarkale 
 MCCOY 
 Yeah. 
 Tarkale 
 MCCOY 
 (beat, disappointed) 
 Thats right and no one gets 
 to take credit for it. 
 
 Tarkale 
 MCCOY 
 (beat) 
 We did everything you’d be 
 doing at the Academy, you’t 
 do anything about it. You were 
 allowed to leave. 
 Tarkale 
 MCCOY 
 Did you? 
 Tarkale 
 MCCOY 
 I did do about a dozen other 
 things. But I’m not going to leave. The 
 Tarkale needs to know why its willing to 
 sacrifice itself for the Tarkale. I’m going 
 to keep doing everything I’M doing to 
 prevent them from doing the same thing. 
 Tarkale 
 MCCOY 
 (beat) 
 I’m sure you’’m right. 
 She takes aim again, making the moment a bit more 
 emotional. TPol watches as this final charge hits the Tarkale, 
 making the ship itself explode. 
 MCCOY 
 I’m sorry about Tarkale’’””””””””””””“”P”-S-K. 
 (beat) 
 I’m sorry that you”
