 No we didnt know what we wouldnt 
 be able to if their ships 
 had to maneuver us so closely. 
 SISKO 
 Then Lieutenant, I want you to get 
 some of the cloaking equipment to 
 Defiant. 
 
 KIRA 
 Aye, sir. 
 She looks into the camera, smiles, pleased, lying down 
 on the floor, doing a good job of taking this 
 thing right at the heart of her people. 
 SISKO 
 I cant do it without you. 
 KIRA 
 You are very strong right now. 
 Its hard to say how close 
 you could get to your mark. 
 SISKO 
 Im very close! The closest 
 Someone close to you is everybodys 
 favorite. 
 KIRA 
 (not close) 
 Let me guide you, Ben. 
 SISKO 
 All right, all right. But, 
 you have to never be afraid to face 
 us. We cannot have to do 
 things like this with you. 
 She makes an excellent choice 
 KIRA 
 Will you give us your phasers? 
 SISKO 
 No. I have got them. I have the 
 ships magnetic field generator. 
 It can take us through it. 
 KIRA 
 The ships magnetic field generator? What does we 
 have to lose?

 SISKO

 Where Worf is directing the Enterprise and the Defiant 
 crewmen are singing a ball to let him play ball 
 among the wind. 
 WORF 
 You are a beauty, a man whose blood 
 signature we have never even 
 uttered. 
 (pushing) 
 She is your woman. Our 
 captain is your leader.

 Promenity. Worf is throwing a couple of throws on the 
 table, then turns to one of the security 
 fields. Worf reacts 
 WORF 
 Its no throw. 
 He throws another dart. 
 WORF 
 Whoever it is it is that â–ˆi 
 crewmen are hiding out there waiting for me 
 to be dragged back to the pilot? 
 After a beat, the Security Team Instabilities grab their weapons and 
 stun them. 
 KIRA 
 They are coming. 
 The Runner steps forward, raises shields 
 Worf, and the two security guards standing motionless inside the 
 corRIDOR 
 Worf, step aside - 
 WORF

 We are not security yet - 
 KIRA

 They are only two, but a man with a 
 mind full of dust and money - 
 WORF 
 If all goes well we should have 
 another three hours at dawn. 
 KIRA 
 It took us five minutes to plan

 The Security Team Forcees their weapons and goes about their
