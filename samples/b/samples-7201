======== SAMPLE 1 ========

 (puzzled) 
 Why? 
 RIKER 
 I hope I dont know. 
 PICARD 
 But I do know that we came 
 here the same 
 as they did. 
 Picard turns from the viewscreen into his 
 office, moves from his office into 
 his private office. He is a man whose words 
 are both pompous and out of control. 
 PICARD 
 (to Tasha) 
 Mister Data, I understand your concerns 
 about our mission. But 
 we need to make certain we are 
 being observed. 
 (beat) 
 We have established ourselves. It would 
 be advisable for me to 
 present our findings before the crew 
 of the Defiant to 
 medical personnel. 
 TASHA 
 Captain, it would be illogical 
 for you to withhold medical 
 personnel from an 
 operation like this one 
 simply for data we 
 cannot put in the computer and 
 deploy it immediately. 
 PICARD 
 Therefore, you must report it to the 
 medical officers as soon as 
 possible. 
 (beat) 
 We will get further information as the 
 medical officers have been able to 
 isolate anything medically out of the 
 Defiants crew. 
 PICARD 
 Very well. 
 (to Riker) 
 Number One, prepare to receive 
 the cargo bay. 
 RIKER 
 Aye, sir. 
 TASHA 
 Captain, we have been talking about the 
 Defiants crew pretty specifically. 
 If you are concerned about the 
 medical supplies, you should 
 check that we have those in the 
 medical closet.

 31A INTERIOR TROI QUARTERS (INTERCUT) 
 TROI is trying to deal with a very angry ALEXANDER. 
 ALEXANDER 
 Why wont you talk to me? I demand 
 my rights anywhere. Where is my 
 captain? 
 TROI 
 Alexander is not a captain. 
 ALEXANDER Why not? 
 TROI 
 ALEXANDER This is so absurd. I know 
 that for certain. 
 ALEXANDER Who are you? 
 TROI 
 My name is Deanna Troi. I 
 am a member of the royal family 
 of Alrik Province. 
 ALEXANDER Why? 
 TROI 
 Your brother has been murdered. Captain 
 Picard has been missing for a long 
 time. 
 ALEXANDER Im sure this is very 
 disturbing. 
 TROI 
 I told you we found him. 
 Captain Picards been trying to 
 locate Captain Picard since the 
 day it was released. 
 It hasnt been found. 
 ALEXANDER Im sure theres 
 as much as you want to believe 
 about this 
 (with a sense of irony) 
 but this is what the captain 
 always sought - to find 
 a way to acquire this trophy. 
 TROI 
 Yes. 
 (beat) 
 But still, it is not just that 
 he will want to take that trophy 
 back to the Federation 
 for what? 
 ALEXANDER What are you suggesting? 
 TROI 
 For the release of this trophy, 
 we must make certain you are 
 able to keep the trophy 
 (beat) 
 We must act together, or we 
 will lose our culture as well. 
 ALEXANDER You feel like you are just 
 saying what you dont want to hear. 
 TROI 
 I hear we may be able to 
 destroy the Malurian system? 
 ALEXANDER It was not that it mattered. 
 He looks at her. 
 ALEXANDER Then maybe you should think 
 of alternatives.

 31A CONTINUED (2) 
 PICARD 
 (to Alexander) 
 Stand back, or I will throw you in 
 the brig. 
 Alexander looks into the viewport and thinks about it for a 
 moment. 
 ALEXANDER 
 (a thoughtful beat) 
 No one is forcing me to 
 make this decision. 
 (beat) 
 Your father was abducted and 
 buried in the binary star cluster.
