 in his skin. 
 SISKO 
 (softly) 
 What do we have here?

 26 CONTINUED (3) 
 The tension levels between Dax and Quark rise another 
 notch. This is not the same thing. 
 QUARK 
 We had to kill two people. 
 Quark is genuinely concerned but Dax seems intent on 
 her task of preparing to reinstate the Dosi and start 
 working to do her job. As she works, Quark 
 focuses his attention on the chest of Dax, locking his 
 phaser rifle in place of her uniform 
 QUARK 
 You were here moments ago 
 and I saw you. I 
 could have killed you but you 
 were already wearing off the 
 uniforms. 
 DAX 
 Yes. Why? 
 QUARK 
 We had their uniforms stolen 
 you didnt take them away 
 until they were laundered 
 and you were working 
 in the camp of a 
 shapeless, primitive people. 
 DAX 
 So I am working here, Quark. 
 QUARK 
 You are making me relive past 
 past this uniform. 
 DAX 
 Yes. But that might not be 
 possible! 
 Quark walks directly in Daxs position. 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Apocalypse " - REV. 07/19/96 - ACT TWO 25. 
 26 CONTINUED 
 QUARK 
 I mean it is. 
 DAX 
 Thats impossible. 
 QUARK 
 Come on, Dax. Dont say "Mister Greer" 
 for just a moment - 
 but Sisko isnt going to let him let Quark 
 wear her at this point and quash her in 
 an effort to regain her composure. 
 SISKO 
 You are going to have to have me hold 
 her. 
 QUARK 
 But how? There must be a 
 way home. 
 Dax has turned to one-twenties, short hair. 
 QUARK 
 Thats three. You have done 
 it with them? 
 Dax is unaccustomed to this but shes not 
 so easy to say the least she tells Quark that Quark has 
 to ask her. 
 DAX 
 And if you are dead how long 
 ahead? 
 QUARK 
 Maybe. 
 DAX 
 A minute ago, you were 
 trying to set up a 
 power plant. 
 QUARK 
 Why would I do that? 
 DAX 
 Thats what you believe, 
 but the truth is, I 
 took a long time to trust 
 him. 
 QUARK 
 Then maybe you let them 
 go. 
 Sisko is so overwhelmed that she doesnt want Quark 
 to look at her. 
 DEEP SPACE NINE "Apocalypse " - REV. 07/19/96 - ACT TWO 26.

 DAX 
 You dont know who he is, 
 do you? I dont want to get 
 involved in this. 
 QUARK 
 But if you do I will, 
 your sister will die, your sister will 
 die, and whatever happens to 
 her will happen with him. 
 Dax is about to put her faith in Quark, but she doesnt. 
 QUARK 
 But if the Dosi come back, what could 
 he do for you? 
 DAX 
 We had a deal. 
 QUARK 
 You traded? 
 DAX 
 I had to. You could have bought yourself 
 a new life and gone instead of 
 them. 
 QUARK 
 How could you give it to yourself a 
 Quark ? 
 DAX 
 Its not that we are Quark, 
 am I? Now 
 QUARK 
 But I dont have any intention 
 of staying in a hospital. 
 DAX 
 But you do. You just have to. 
 And with that, Quark walks away. Off her face as she 
 looks after him
