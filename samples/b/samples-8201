 working that

 takes a beat and then 
 steps up to a wall panel 
 OBrien moves over to the wall panel and 
 stares at a monitor displaying an Okudagram

 Bashir at a console ODO is working in several different shifts to shift, moving 
 equipment, etc 
 BASHIR

 Incoming transmission from the 
 surface, Captain. 
 13 INTERIOR INFIRGERY 
 Sisko is waiting anxiously, Dax and OBrien still on 
 monitors 
 14 INTERIOR SURGERY 
 BASHIR 
 Red alert. On screen. 
 Kira/Lawton and Dax come from the adjacent room. 
 KIRA 
 And our uniforms look different 
 than the uniforms they wear, 
 sitting neat and casual.

 DAX 
 Why? 
 KIRA 
 They have changed so much. Shes 
 been absorbed by the Alpha 
 Quadrant now, 
 theres almost nothing to distinguish 
 from the two of us and she 
 doesnt even 
 know what planet she is 
 anymore. 
 DAX 
 I wonder if theres anything 
 common between them 
 KIRA 
 Theres always some. Theres

 OBRIEN (O.S.) 
 Its no coincidence that the I have seen 
 the same set of gloves 
 they were carrying. 
 BASHIR 
 And you think they work feverishly, 
 or that they break under the pressure 
 they put on? 
 OBrien holds his hand up and the image BASHIR POVES as 
 the hand dangles off Bashir, OBrien whos taken out for him 
 in his arms while Julian and Winn ENTER. 
 KIRA 
 (sotto) 
 I wonder if you have never noticed 
 that some creatures can resist 
 an enzyme that induces 
 metabolic collapse. 
 DEEP SPACE "Blood Oath" - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO 18. 
 14 CONTINUED (3) 
 BASHIR 
 (melodramatically) 
 A natural enzyme. You should be 
 aware of that. My father 
 was a human, not an 
 animal. 
 KIRA 
 (swallowing at the irony) 
 The old saying in the Medical 
 Collection Network is, "Enem". 
 (A beat, looking ahead) 
 The hands on your neck must be 
 what they need to remove 
 the symbionts from your 
 host - what does it matter 
 to repair your entire leg? 
 BASHIR 
 The symbionts been altered 
 just to be in your case. You 
 wont need to do anything you 
 dont want to. 
 KIRA 
 You wouldnt be able to. 
 BASHIR 
 I know this is unfortunate 
 but we dont have the ability 
 to make a cure for what 
 is malignant my species 
 KIRA 
 I was on the mission that 
 found the symbionts and remember 
 anything, 
 I really believed that you 
 were the last straw 
 on my life and you 
 tried to wipe out the 
 symbionts without any 
 host and it worked. 
 (BASHIR 
 (reacts at a sudden 
 realization) 
 This symbionts taken you 
 BASHIR 
 And it just happened again 
 this month when I 
 was attacked 
 KIRA 
 How different is it to change 
 the host? 
 BASHIR 
 Theres no host, but that doesnt 
 make it any easier or more 
 (reacts) 
 You are not on this 
 right now, Julian. You have just 
 changed the host. 
 (back at the 
 computer, Kira just sits there. She 
 starts to think) 
 Maybe my symbionts rigged an 
 entire host into your core
