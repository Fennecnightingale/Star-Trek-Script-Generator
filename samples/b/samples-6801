THAKS 
 A storm has struck the Cardassian 
 colony. We are evacuating 
 all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven 
 Three.

 KEIKO 
 Sounds like weather. 
 OBRIEN 
 Thats it. 
 Sisko looks out the window at the 
 main viewer as TKar works his console. 
 KEIKO 
 (continuing) 
 We are receiving flood waves from the 
 colony and the main 
 deflector is standing by. The 
 storms have shifted back and forth. It 
 must have entered our sensor 
 range. 
 SISKO 
 Is there a problem, or are still there 
 no indications of any 
 additional vessels in the area? 
 KEIKO 
 No, sir. 
 SISKO 
 Commander, signal the mining settlement 
 that we will take shelter. Send EMERGENCY. 
 Sisko, Kira, and Bashir send the miners on board 
 - they are not authorized to depart. 
 Sisko and the others move aboard the craft. 
 SISKO 
 (to Kira) 
 You all clear the asteroid bands. 
 BASHIR 
 Aye, sir. 
 The lights begin to move, and the ship moves away from the 
 planets. 
 DEEP SPACE "The Sacrifice of Angels" - REV. 7/25/92 - ACT TWO 28. 
 BASHIR 
 We will be the scientists tomorrow. 
 KEIKO 
 No more. I have work 
 ahead. 
 BASHIR 
 The tides have been too strong - 
 and theres too much 
 deuterium for me to bring aboard. 
 SISKO 
 Better? 
 BASHIR 
 More of a problem, perhaps. 
 Sounds like you are listening. 
 SISKO 
 I think you have heard enough from now. 
 BASHIR 
 More or less. 
 SISKO 
 I dont think your people have much 
 influence over what they do. They were 
 the aggressors. Now, if thats 
 true, Im pretty sure you have got 
 enough evidence to support those 
 actions. 
 I want to offer a few simple questions to 
 all of you 
 Sisko rises. 
 SISKO 
 I dont want an answer either. 
 BASHIR 
 Because we have been through a lot 
 together. 
 DEEP SPACE "The Sacrifice of Angels" - REV. 7/25/92 - ACT TWO 28A.

 SISKO 
 Yes. But it doesnt matter. None of 
 us are alone. 
 BASHIR 
 I am alone. 
 SISKO 
 And theres no way you can influence 
 us. You have to do things the 
 way way you always have. 
 BASHIR 
 (simply) 
 The way? 
 SISKO 
 You will have to take me there. To help 
 you. Is that clear? 
 BASHIR 
 Yes, sir.

 SLOWARD 
 SLOWARD 
 SLOWARD 
 SLOWARD 
 Very well. But I will be leaving the 
 Defiants to our friends.

 SISKO 
 But Im not leaving you anyplace 
 BASHIR 
 Yes, the captain is right. 
 SLOWARD 
 But I must ask 
 BASHIR 
 Yes, sir. 
 SLOWARD 
 Please. 
 SLOWARD 
 Sir 
 Siskos attitude to him was interesting. 
 SISKO 
 Its hard to imagine this man who knew the way 
 to destroy the world without 
 realizing that he had a lot of friends. 
 BASHIR 
 I had an opportunity to make some 
 friends when you were younger, 
 but he took me outside 
 SLOWARD 
 And you have never forgiven him. 
 SISKO 
 I have forgiven him. Why are you 
 holding this ship and the crew this? 
 BASHIR 
 It all makes sense now. We all have our 
 problems sometimes.
