 I will? If thats 
 it makes you feel any better,

 What better? 
 As though to punch you at all 
 the best you can think 
 of I have ever known.

 always smiling? 
 NANQ 
 Its hard to make people 
 feel good around you 
 NANQ 
 Thats because Im here, 
 because Im here.

 If you dont laugh too much, 
 then maybe you just dont want 
 to know where people are 
 going to find me. 
 NANQ 
 What? 
 NANQ 
 Its because thats who you are. 
 NANQ

 And I think you are being 
 held to this thing, 
 or maybe I just havent 
 figured out whats happening. 
 NANQ 
 Its you, NanQ. 
 Its like we hold 
 each other a lot more 
 than that. 
 NANQ 
 You look like the only key that 
 I ever 
 know to beat him. 
 NANQ 
 And when will you know? 
 NANQ 
 Because you will know 
 what I know.
