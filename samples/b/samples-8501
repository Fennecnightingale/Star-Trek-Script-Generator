======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 
 SUDER Im not sure. Some day. 
 TUCKER You are making a mistake. Somethings coming. 
 SUDER What? 
 TUCKER TPol. 
 TUCKER What the fuck? 
 TPOL Come in. 
 (Sickbay) 
 TPAU Its okay. 
 PHLOX I have been running scans of the ship that attacked us and I 
 have picked up signs of life. 
 TPAU Its likely the attacker returned with a ship. 
 PHLOX It doesnt look like he did. 
 TPAU Doctor, if he has access to the ships computer system for 
 medical purposes, he should be able to send someone back with a 
 healing patient. 
 PHLOX Thats assuming he has no reservations. 
 TPAU Doctor, is it possible that we are telling the truth? 
 PHLOX Its certainly possible. I have a bit of a lee here, but I will have to check 
 the sensor logs. 
 TPAU You are asking me to trust that with his condition, you have nothing to 
 do but have faith. Have you chosen a name for yourself yet? 
 PHLOX My current name is Phlox, but my former name is Tobin. 
 TPAU Oh, no. Tobin, ever since that night, you have been the 
 only doctor we have. 
 PHLOX And now you are going to have to trust Tobin. 
 TPAU Not this time. 
 PHLOX The last time I saw you like that, this was before you 
 became sick. 
 TPAU Im sure not. 
 PHLOX I have always suspected Tobin was the devil, but that 
 Tobin had actually become a demon. I pray 
 that in the pages of the wall, before you went into the chamber, you 
 were warned that a bloodthirsty enemy would surround me. 
 TPAU I ignored him. 
 TPAU A foolish mistake. Perhaps I will learn to consult the manual. 
 PHLOX You dont have to. It is much easier than coming to pray. 
 (Torres-Paris quarters) 
 PARIS (OC) Come in. 
 TORRES Oh, hello. 
 PARIS (OC) Howd you know I hadnt heard, that I was in the room with you? 
 TORRES Yes. Its late. And I thought you might like to talk. 
 PARIS Its a little more personal than that, the devil. 
 TORRES I checked with my sources at Starfleet 
 DEJARIS (OC) No, I have got no references. 
 KIM If you want reference, you should find me at 
 Dejars. 
 TORRES I dont have any references. Its not my station. 
 DEJARIS (OC) I require food. 
 TORRES This is not my ship. Its my crew. 
 DEJARIS (OC) Oh, what are the chances youd actually be on with me? 
 TORRES I have actually spoken with the captain. He assured me 
 that I stay in my quarters until I get back. I like you so much. I know 
 you always listen to my voice. When you need something to 
 occupy your attention, I like you to come. 
 DEJARIS (OC) Good luck. 
 TORRES What is it? 
 DEJARIS (OC) I have calculated the odds. 
 TORRES What are you doing here? 
 DEJARIS (OC) Stay in my quarters until I tell you otherwise. 
 TORRES How long do you have for? 
 DEJARIS (OC) Thirty minutes to shift change of plans. 
 TORRES Why dont I get it, Lieutenant? 
 DEJARIS (OC) The captains making a mistake. Hes letting you get home but 
 there is no reason. We have a schedule 
 TORRES I know it looks complicated. 
 DEJARIS (OC) Sorry if we put more money in my account. I 
 believe Dejars plan may have saved us all. 
 TORRES Then I want to know. 
 DEJARIS (OC) Oh, you dont have to. I realise the temptation to go out 
 there, but I cant go that far. 
 TORRES Its not that big. 
 DEJARIS I owe it to him. Dont you see? Money is what you want. 
 Money is how you win. 
 TORRES Why would you have any idea 
 DEJARIS I think I know. You are not a
