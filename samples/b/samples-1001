 22 INTERIOR SICKBAY 
 Beverly and two N.D.s. are working to reconstruct the patient from his 
 damaged system. Nella ENTERS. Beverly stands by as the two men in Sickbay 
 work for a few moments. 
 BRYTON What are you doing? 
 Beverly looks at the two men in Sickbay. 
 BEVERLY Doctor, Im ready for you. 
 Nella looks at Beverly and she doesnt trust him yet. Beverly begins to use a medo- 
 bed to prepare her for surgery. Nella comes in. 
 OBRIEN Doctor to Beverly Beverly. 
 I have just administered an experimental procedure to try to clear 
 the blood of some kind of venom. Its very disturbing. 
 Beverly is a little taken aback by the sight of a strange feeling 
 coming over her senses. She looks at herself in an equally strange manner. 
 Beverly is holding her by the arm. 
 WIDER Beverly turns to see 
 23 ANGLE ON OBRIEN - SickBAY 
 OBRIEN Its still in pain. 
 Beverly is very confused. She looks as Beverly is running a diagnostic 
 evaluation on him. She stands by as Beverly works over OBrien. 
 Beverly moves down 
 BRYTON You are the last person to 
 enter Sickbay. 
 BURNHAM Yes. 
 Beverly looks at OBrien. 
 BURNHAM So you are the last patient to 
 enter Sickbay. 
 OBRIEN Im a doctor, and I am the last patient 
 to enter Sickbay. 
 DEEP SPACE NELE Thank you to you, Beverly. 
 (the bed) 
 BURNHAM Drinks on ice. 
 OBriens hand is still at work. 
 OBRIEN I have done nothing but lie 
 here in these corridors 
 BURNHAM You dont even know who I am? 
 OBRIEN Its impossible to say 
 BURNHAM If this is true, why arent you 
 here? 
 OBRIEN My name is OBrien. 
 OBRIEN When you ask me, Im the 
 last good citizen I ever 
 heard of my name. I believe I was 
 murdered 
 BURNHAM You are still very much alive. 
 OBRIEN A couple of romantics. 
 Bev, can it talk? 
 BURNHAM I am alive, as well. 
 OBRIEN I am dead, still in the same room 
 but apparently in some kind of a temporal 
 limbo. 
 BARNET You are right. I believe I died 
 yesterday. 
 BURNHAM Thats impossible 
 BARNET You can say its a miracle 
 of invention. 
 DEEP SPACE NEEL Captain, Im reading a disturbing 
 temporal rift 
 OBRIEN I dont understand. 
 OBRIEN This rift? 
 BARNET Maybe its a gravimetric rift. 
 (He pauses with a look to Beverly) 
 OBRIEN Thats the way it looks from 
 right through to 
 23A ANGLE 
 As Beverly looks up at him. 
 OBRIEN What are you reading? 
 BURNHAM Nothing. 
 BARNET You are right. 
 OBriens hand is still pointing on the rift. 
 OBRIEN You said the rift was 
 closing. 
 BARNET All of this? 
 BOIM Yes. 
 27 EXTERIOR SPACE (OPTICAL) 
 The Enterprise in a dead halt outside the wormhole. 
 28 OMITTED 
 OBRIEN and Nella ENTER. Beverly watches 
 them for a beat. 
 BEVERLY You have got to find 
 OBrien. 
 OBRIEN Theres not enough power 
 to operate the sensor array. 
 BOIM Thats only going to slow 
 the wormhole 
 BURNHAM I just want to 
 locate and confirm if 
 the wormhole is indeed 
 closing. 
 OBRIEN I want to know who you are. 
 OBRIEN And please, dont tell me you 
 are going to find out that I am the 
 Cardassian Ambassador. 
 BURNHAM The truth is, I dont care either 
 of you 
 Nella runs a tricorder scan of OBrien as well 
 as Beverly. 
 BOIM I have been reading the Federation Charter 
 since I was firstborn. 
 OBRIEN Thats all right, Nella. 
 Nella sits beside Beverly and looks at Beverly for a moment, as if 
 realizing that shes the only one on the Bridge answering all
