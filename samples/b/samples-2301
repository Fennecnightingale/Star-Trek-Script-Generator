======== SAMPLE 1 ========
.. 
 BEVERLY 
 Captain, I have got a feeling here. Its 
 not good. 
 Well, you are right, but there are times when life 
 becomes so short or more like that. 
 PICARD 
 What else? 
 BEVERLY 
 All the extra jobs in this ship 
 that werent filled with people 
 before it was abandoned. 
 BEVERLY 
 Except for Beverly. 
 Beverly is looking at him with genuine tears in her eyes. 
 BEVERLY 
 She said that she was so 
 interested she sent you. 
 PICARD 
 I guess she was really going after 
 you. 
 BEVERLY 
 I know I know 
 PICARD 
 How. 
 BEVERLY 
 You were a man in love with her 
 BEVERLY 
 I had so much to do. 
 (beat) 
 PICARD 
 What do you want, Doctor? 
 BEVERLY 
 What I want to know, I bet her was feeling 
 sorry for herself.

 BEVERLY 
 You said it was like 
 an "honour to meet her" 
 PICARD 
 (smiling) 
 I know she was a little emotional, 
 but thats no 
 BEVERLY 
 What do you think? 
 Picard looks at her in a different way. 
 PICARD 
 I think shes right. 
 RIKER 
 She seems fine. 
 But still no idea what she means 
 or whats really been 
 doing with her 
 PICARD 
 Can you explain something? 
 BEVERLY 
 I feel more like her now. 
 Theres more to life. And as 
 you begin to know that, you will find your 
 true happiness as well as you 
 know it. 
 Picard stares at her with determination. 
 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 I want to help you, Doctor. 
 BEVERLY 
 As the captain of a starship, 
 yes 
 PICARD 
 What about that day we spent at the 
 Denvers, our mission 
 to Proconce Lost ? 
 BEVERLY 
 Thats right. We went to 
 Denvers, found out if this 
 was any kind of home 
 Earth training as Picard and Riker 
 RIKER 
 (to Data) 
 Data - what are those letters? 
 DATA 
 The letters come from Jean-Luc, a 
 French monk 
 who enjoys reading and writing on the 
 net, and that a little reading 
 wasnt it?

 BEVERLY 
 They are private. 
 DATA 
 (smiling) 
 He wouldnt read that kind of 
 thing in public. 
 BEVERLY 
 But Im not having to look any 
 more at the house 
 DATA 
 The house is rented. I recommend a 
 security guard, if you are not. 
 Beverly glances at him, happy as she sees Datas new- 
 heart. 
 BEVERLY 
 Jean-Luc Picard I dont know what 
 you know about the guy, but I do know 
 you make a good woman. 
 Data starts moving toward the door, Beverly watching, 
 keeping an eye on Riker. 
 BEVERLY 
 (continuing) 
 Beverly, you have something we need 
 a minute. Get away from there the 
 instant you are back to the table. 
 Data and Riker EXIT into the door, disappearing 
 behind the curtain. Picard and Riker stand there 
 staring at the empty bed, confused. 
 PICARD 
 Picard to Riker - 
 DATA 
 Picard here. 
 PICARD 
 (to com) 
 Data, what is it? 
 DATA 
 It is not good. Theres 
 nothing moving from the present 
 data wave. 
 PICARD 
 (continuing) 
 Doctor Crusher to Captain Picard. 
 BEVERLY 
 On my way, Jean-Luc. 
 Picard and Data EXIT back to Geordi and the shuttle. But 
 Data moves toward him.
