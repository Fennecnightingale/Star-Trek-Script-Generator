 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Sound " - REV. 11/29/98 - ACT FOUR 45.

71 QUARK 
 (losing) 
 Wheres Odo?
 (he finds Quark staring in 
 the window) 
 Whats going on here?

 He takes a beat, realizing the magnitude of it 
 Odo seems too wrapped up in his own thoughts.

 ODO
 (outraged) 
 What am I doing?

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Sound " - REV. 11/29/98 - ACT FOUR 46.

71 CONTINUED

 QUARK 
 I dont know.

 ODO
 I think Im going to find out who 
 knows who, what is going on. 
 But Im pretty sure theres 
 plenty more than just news.

 QUARK 
 Im not going to just lay 
 the "dabo" over you. Im 
 going right by it.

 ODO 
 If it isnt Quark, Im pretty 
 sure that you are not, either. 
 (a beat) 
 Do me a favor, old friend.
 (a beat) 
 I dont think you are going to be 
 happy.

 QUARK 
 Just think about it.

 ODO
 Do what?

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Sound " - REV. 11/29/98 - ACT FOUR 46A.

71 CONTINUED (2)

 ODO
 What I do. You are not telling me to 
 stand by and watch and listen to the 
 little children playing with your 
 own kind of game. Its not my job 
 you are supposed to 
 be it isn’t it?

 QUARK 
 Its my problem. I cant 
 sit by and wait for the 
 next wave of Klingon 
 magic to become a reality.

 ODO
 Quark, how can you say that?
 (he shakes his head, surprised) 
 I have never seen you looking so 
 ravishing.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Sound " - REV. 11/29/98 - ACT FOUR 47.

71 CONTINUED (3)

 QUARK 
 I mean it, Odo. I hate it. I hate 
 you, Odo.
 (off Odos incredulous look) 
 You are the god.

 ODO
 Thank you in a lot of ways.

 Odo and Quark both turn and EXIT. Quark looks coldly and 
 lifelessly drained, a lump of self-awareness gone back in his eyes.

 QUARK 
 Thank you. I never knew what 
 else I could have done.

 ODO
 Quark, lets just go. Get out of here.

 Odo and Quark walk away, leaving Quark alone and depressed.

 QUARK 
 He is dead. This is not your.

 Odo, still feeling guilty, approaches Quarks 
 and puts a hand to his head when he senses that 
 her there, she responds with a sound familiar.

 ODO
 Dont look at me in the face, 
 Odo. There’s nothing I can do.

 QUARK 
 It is a lie. No matter how 
 much they deny it.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "The Sound " - REV. 11/29/98 - ACT FOUR 48.

71 CONTINUED (4)

 Odo, now feeling more at ease with the fact that 
 whats happened, and she knows it.

 ODO 
 You mean a lie?

 QUARK 
 Thats what I told you. There was 
 nothing done to the little 
 lady. And to any Klingon 
 woman that had anything to do 
 with you? Never mind her 
 again. And when she is gone, no 
 one will ever find her.

 Odo takes Quarks arm and stares at it, but no 
 longer. Quark understands what it means.

 QUARK 
 A Klingon is always a Klingon. 
 The word carries great 
 weight. And like many of us. Odo, 
 I know what I have learned. I find 
 you to be one of the most 
 fortunate men in the history of 
 our species. And I have 
 learned even more about your 
 species than I have 
 learned about your, Odo.

 ODO 
 Have you learned what I do 
 yourself?

 Odo takes Quarks arm and points it at him.

 ODO 
 I see you have a good sense of 
 humor,
