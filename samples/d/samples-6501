 TASHA
 Commander, my people have learned they can 
 survive without a military presence. 
 I know your people do, Commander.

 SISKO
 Yes, they do.

 TASHA
 And what if its not possible that the 
 Cardassians wont find a way 
 out of this war?


 DEEP SPACE "Duet" - 11/27/93 - ACT FOUR 44.

 SISKO
 Im not saying that 
 anything can. The war 
 could still be won.

 TASHA
 If we dont find a way out?

 SISKO
 Its not up to us. There are 
 twenty million lives down there, 
 Captain the lives you are saving 
 them all over the galaxy.

 TASHA
 Sisko if you want to rescue 
 those lives, fine fine by me. But there 
 will be repercussions for five 
 million lives down there.

 TASHA
 You are willing to leave them up 
 to that?

 SISKO
 Thats the most important thing 

 TASHA
 I really do respect your ability to respond 
 to questions you wish 

 SISKO
 Mister 

 TASHA
 Commander 

 TASHA
 You did that for some of us a long time. 
 Perhaps you have forgotten that.

 SISKO
 Some of the questions I asked you do they 
 come to me they are answers as questions we are 
 asked.

 TASHA
 (to Taur)
 And you were willing to consider 
 sacrificing two lives to save a
 dozen.

 TASHA
 As I expected, Commander.

 TASHA
 It was the other choice, wasnt it?

 TASHA
 I thought I know what I was doing then.

 TJON TAN
 (smiles)
 We just did.

 TJON TUNIVERSTS, and 

 TJON
 Its a good thing you didnt have any 
 contact with us.

 TASHA
 I remember seeing my mother on the 
 way to run the refitting circuit.

 TASHA
 Thats because she was in charge 
 of those experiments 

 TJON TUNIVERS
 What?
 (off her look)
 At least you know what you are 
 thinking.
 (a beat)
 It just became a little 
 a fairy tale of imagination I was 
 thinking of me as a child 

 TASHA
 You sure your mothers stomach would support 
 your fantasy?

 TASHA
 (surprised)
 Me?

 Sisko, Jake and Alley look up the steps - 
 the security guards are around the corner. And as they 
 continue up, we

37 INTERIOR SECURITY OFFICE (OPTICAL)

 Kira enters Siskos office and sees a phaser 
 pointed across her eyebrow. She smiles.

 JASON
 I wanted to thank you for 
 returning a little late. You dont exactly remember 
 the rest of it any of it.

 KIRA
 I did the best I could.

 JASON
 The good work you have done, Major.

 JASON
 Not that I dont know about you are going to 
 make it that far. Trust me. I will be 
 home.

 KIRA
 We may get you to get out of 
 here - but you are not the best person 
 we have seen. I will get your wife 
 to get home. Dont you 

 JASON
 She will be all right. Dont be 
 sentimental, Major.
 (a beat)
 It doesnt matter, you just do. Its 
 life you are living now. You cant 
 die again.

 KIRA
 I know where I am.

 JASON
 (surprised)
 I know how you are. You can hide 
 it easily if youd even try. Now, 
 you are hiding everything you could potentially 
 get.
 (a beat)
 So, whats your life expectancy? Two 
 hundred thousand years? And you cant even live 
 today.
