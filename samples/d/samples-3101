======== SAMPLE 1 ========

 I can have the equipment they used me for 
 our little reason to attack their 
 forces.

 DAX
 They use our technology to do 
 that as well.

 WORF 
 And they used our technology to 
 do so.

 SISKO
 (picks up the phaser) 
 We have some pretty good 
 weapons at the Dominion.

 WORF 
 Not on our own weapons.
 (to Sisko) 
 If you attack them, you must be 
 going to end up with 
 a lot of dead, as soon as 
 we have the technology here.

 DAX
 (smiles)
 We are. We have just begun 
 getting what will become their 
 territory. When we destroy 
 their homeworld, they will be 
 scrambling and we want to 
 keep them out of our way forever 
 long.

 SISKO

 DAX
 (urgentaken, to 
 Bashir) 
 Dax, I said 

 BASHIR 
 (reassuring) 
 Hold on, hold on.

 BASHIR 
 If we fire, we are going to end 
 up starting a war.

 EZRI 
 That couldnt happen. 
 We wouldnt risk the 
 Empire potentially getting involved 
 with the Empire, the Dominion 
 wouldnt. Theres a chance of 
 ending the war if we let our 
 people keep it.

 SISKO
 But what if we just let everyone go?

 DAX
 (with irony) 
 If I let you decide to let the 
 Empire go, theres no telling you you 
 will end up with forty pieces of 
 gold press latinum.

 SISKO
 Thats not fair. I think we have 
 to risk the Empire in the 
 midst of war.

 DAX 
 Let them go if we have to.

 BASHIR 
 We are talking about all you have 
 got to do about the Dominion. You have got 
 to get the people to our 
 posts.

 SISKO
 (to Worf) 
 If we go, we will be killing fifty 
 JemHadar soldiers every day.

 DAX 
 Thats an order.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "What You " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 119.

117 CONTINUED (2) 117 CONTINUED 

 DAX 
 You keep the order, you carry 
 it.

 SISKO 
 (glancing at her) 
 When are you going to carry out 
 those orders? When are you 
 going to execute fifty innocent men? When 
 are we going to start a war between the 
 Dominion and the Federation? When do we 
 begin hostilities with the Federation? All that 
 we ask is that you be ready to look 
 over every little we have done to 
 do is pave the way for what could 
 happen tomorrow morning, at the start of 
 a new war?

 DAX
 As of this moment, everyone knows the 
 battle is over. We are being hailed 
 every fifty kilometers. Every 
thing you have to do is be
 right there. Everythings orders.

 SISKO
 (dry) 
 I dont care what orders you have, 
 Mister Worf. All I care about is my 
 people.

 DAX
 Thats true, Commander. But it 
 does give you hope that, at this 
 time, that Im going to lead 
 a new offensive.

 DAX
 I would go along with you, captain.

 SISKO
 Id be a brave man if I were
 you.

 DAX
 But youd be surprised if your 
 offensive was successful.

 SISKO 
 Very well.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "What You " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 120.

117 CONTINUED (3) 117 CONTINUED (4) 117A new ANGLE 

 DAX (Contd)
 Im leading an offensive that will take 
 the entire JemHadar to 
 defend its territory and promote the 
 foundation of a new government.

 SISKO
 Do we really think you will lead a
 successful offensive?

 DAX
 If I could make sure the 
 Dominion was on the defensive, we 
 should be able to eradicate the 
 Dominion within the hour. There have
 to be a moment
