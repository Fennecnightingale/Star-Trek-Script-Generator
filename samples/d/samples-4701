 are sitting together at a computer table.

 GEORDI
 We went to a party last night for
 the anniversary of my father. He took a few...
 four and a half hours to finish
 all of his homework. I was
 home for a week or so.

 PICARD
 I have been home for thirteen
 days. If I hadnt been home,
 I wouldnt have had time to read
 the daily newspaper.

 GEORDI
 As long as I could see him,
 I could have saved him his
 life.

 Riker has come to take a similar
 line, speaking with Picard as though
 reacting to some loudmouth who is yelling in the
 room, shaking off the situation.

 RIKER
 (shrugs)
 You know his.

 He looks around the room. He is shocked.

 GEORDI
 We had to have him, and for
 that, I am thankful. You,
 you are good at times.

 GEORDI

 RIKER

 The three of you from playing in
 the school. They are home to their
 parents. If I get my son,
