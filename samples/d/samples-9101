 I know, Doctor. I know the Cardassians.

 DATA/I
 But the truth is hes right about
 there, sir.

 TROI
 (re the
 wreckage)
 My Cardassians killed their prisoners
 and my President has made
 a plea to his people forgive
 them.

 DATA/I
 (agreed)
 What he has done will make more
 enemies for them to defeat.

 KIRK
 Something right at hand, Data. Its
 the price they are now paying for
 their crimes. Its nothing
 but profit.
 (beat)
 What I will do is give them a new Cardassia. You
 may become a convenient target for my
 people to murder it down on
 your Bridge.

 DATA/I
 (interrupts)
 It is too late, Captain. Its already
 happened.

 Data is already on the move toward the Turbolift. The doors
 shut behind him. Data steps onto the next pad.

 DATA
 Welcome. Do you know how to make it?

 KIRK
 (grim)
 Pretty simple. We have a prisoner
 there.

 Data takes his position.

 DATA
 The man you have been looking for
 your entire race appears to be
 a Barzan. He was my father.

 KIRK
 Not for a Bajoran.

 DATA
 But he was my father.

 DATA
 Do not confuse me. I know a
 humanoid who was held prisoner
 for four years under
 Cardassians. He asked me for my
 name. I have been waiting to
 die with him to receive justice.
 He gave me my life. If he had given
 me my life, I would have
 appreciated it.

 He EXITS. On Koros, whos heard Datas story.

 KOROS
 (to com)
 Computer. Locate a Bajoran
 transport for Betazed.

 COMPUTER VOICE

 Data hits a panel on a nearby console.

 DATA

 KOROS
 (continuing)
 Entering Betazed, four
 eighty.

 DATA
 Acknowledged.

 KOROS
 (pleased)
 Four eighty? Thats the next we have
 got. Four eighty.

 Data exits the ship. Koros looks after him
 thoughtfully.

 Red Alert.

 The ships alarm sounds.

 PICARD
 Stand by.

 RIKER
 Riker, signal our ships on the bridge.
 Inform my ship that two of our crew is
 ready to return.
 (beat, concerned)
 Three vessels have just entered sensor
 range, Major. Tell our
 captain and the Bajoran ships that we
 think they may be holding our
 interest.

 PICARD
 Stand by two, Ensign.

 The Viewer shows the star stretching beyond our own horizon.
 Picard glances toward the command area, where Riker
 is staring right now at his own stars.
