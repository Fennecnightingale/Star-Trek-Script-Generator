 Im afraid it wont be possible
 or at least not for me to say it
 so it may happen again one way or another. If
 things dont work well, we will both
 lose you and your ship. If I take down
 your shuttle, I may lose
 you too, but you both lose you and me. You will need someone
 around you to survive at least in a
 shuttlecraft.

 Picard, then turning to him.

 PICARD
 I can think of nothing Id rather do than stay alive
 aboard your shuttlecraft.

 Picard turns and reaches out for his son, but his face is blanked
 by a sudden pain - he falls unconscious.

36 INTERIOR SICKBAY (CONTINUOUS)

 CLOSE ON Beverly as she tries to hold on to
 the bioregenerative field. Unable to break her
 limp grip, she tries to pull her son away from
 us. But before she can say anything, a wave of
 dizziness doubles her over that she cant
 hold on to it - her hair, body, body -
 her whole
 crew is gone, and she is just a
 couple inches above
 where she was - her eyes fill with
 a sick expression that makes her
 unsteady.

 BEVERLY
 (to Data)
 Data - can he remove the
 medical tricorders or me?

 Data gives her a brief moment before repositioning his face
 and moving closer to her.

 standing beside him she tries to comfort him.

 as he prepares to remove his VISOR. BEVERLY
 It worked 

 DATA
 Very 

 BEVERLY
 (quietly)
 I remember something Dr. Troi
 used to say - that
 the transporter was to me.

 There is a moment.

 DATA
 Are you going to tell me how?
 (to BEVERLY)
 Have you ever thought about abandoning
 my son?

 BEVERLY
 (beat)
 I guess this time maybe I should
 have looked up from my
 work and decided to spend the
 rest of his life with you?

 DATA
 You will need more time. With the
 exception of the sick,
 everything would be okay.

 The boy turns around and looks away, then
 as he does so he loses his parents eyes for
 a last time and they are all watching him. Theres
 a long beat.

 DATA
 Aye, maam 
 (beat)
 Im going to find Data.

 BEVERLY
 Data ?

 DATA
 (beat)
 Yes, maam.

 He EXITS, leaving them alone. Beby and
 Troi exchange a look.

 Picard, Riker, La Forge,
 Hobson, the others continue working
 as the computer is about to crash down. Hobson
