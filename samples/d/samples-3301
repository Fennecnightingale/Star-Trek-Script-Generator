/ter this isnâ€™t so 
 much like 
 engineering. If we can 
 find a way to reach the exit, 
 its all.
 (a beat)
 I owe you an apology, 
 Jean-Luc. I have been most 
 concerned about engineering.
 You are a true engineer. You 
 should have never given up.

 BORATH 
 (soft)
 I cant help that woman. But 
 I dont understand.

 BORATH 
 I know you have engineering.

 BORATH 
 Oh, you are wrong. She wouldnt 
 have had it. I knew all about 
 her, I could even have given her 
 the same ship to her.
 (an apology) 
 But I never gave up my home 
 I would have turned her over to 
 you, or even in her 
 own family to her, 
 would I.

 BORATH
 (hard)
 Dont tell her that you care 
 about her.

 Borath takes a quiet long beat.

 BORATH 
 Well I will tell her how I 
 felt about that.

 Baandath stares at him, realizing that the plan is 
 not going to be successful either.

 BORATH 
 Oh no, Baothath you are not the 
 lady.

 Baath is silent for a moment.

 BORATH 
 What you are doing is getting started.

 Baath moves to join her, takes her arm.

 BORATH 
 (hard)
 If the truth were known, this 
 woman would die.

 BORATH 
 (hard) 
 I do not give her orders, 
 Baath.

 BORATH
 But if they tell she
 to go back to you with 
 this man, then she will die.
 (another painful 
 blow on him) 
 She would die with everyone 
 if she lived.

 Baath steps in.

 BORATH 
 (hard) 
 It will kill her.

 Sisko steps forward.

 OBRIEN 
 All right, listen to me. I have got an 
 emergency medical procedure done. Im 
 going to go get her.

 BORATH
 (hard) 
 You are right.

 Baath realizes he is not going to get too worked 
 up about it.

 BORATH 
 She should go. Her life is still 
 hers.

 BORATH
 (hard) 
 They are all in agreement, not 
 you.

 BORATH
 Thats right.

 BORATH 
 Dont listen to me she has 
 an emergency medical 
 procedure and that you have 
 no right to interfere 

 OBRIEN
 Then this is getting started.

 BORATH 
 It will be worse - she 
 would not be alive.
 (a beat) 
 Dont listen to him, I 
 can help her.

 Baath looks to Sisko, who looks over at 
 Odo and takes in a bitter tirade.

 BORATH
 (hard) 
 Dont you see, you are too 
 dangerous to risk it. The 
 Federation is the greatest adversaries 
 in the world. The Federation is the 
 aggressor of all lifeforms on the 
 station. They are prepared to kill me 
 to save.

 SISKO
 You are a coward, you are a traitor. I 
 offer you the same - as 
 well you see. The Federation is your 
 enemy, we will destroy you to save a 
 life form.

 BORATH 
 Then I can give you the means to control 
 me.

 SISKO
 (cutting him on his right ear)
 I dont say, he says you are all 
 to get up in that face and call me 
 and the Federation will take your place to 
 kill you.

 Baath looks at his arms.

 BORATH
 Let me cry one last cold hour and then 
 it comes to this they are all 
 with the Federation. I will 
 get to the Federation. In all 
 the evil ways.

 You cant do this. You cant 
 do this. I could kill
