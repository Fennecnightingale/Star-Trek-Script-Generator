 Worf and Dax, Kargan out.

 WORF
 What happened? You gave us what you 
 originally wanted, Captain.

 DAX
 We need your help again.

 Worf and Dax escort Dax 

 KIRA
 This is a very dangerous world 
 Lieutenant Worf, the situation 
 is very volatile. There are constant 
 threats of attack and violence, and they 
 seem to go far more quickly than I expected 

 DAX
 Worf and Dax have managed to get the problem 
 under control.

 WORF
 The planet is definitely making 
 serious challenges, Major. It has 
 started to make a serious threat.

 DAX
 Worf and Dax were able to kill 
 him.

 DEX
 How long until it can be fully 
 funded?

 Dax works the console Worf works it 

 DAX
 Three hours.

 DEX
 Approaching the planetary system.

 DAX
 It wont be much of a prize 

 WORF
 No, it will not. Captain, the 
 threat of an energy-pulse continues for the 
 rest of the time.

 DAX
 What if a pulse of that energy pulse 
 kills Worf and Dax?

 WORF
 Possibly. It is also possible that the 
 energy-pulse was right of 
 the outset, it may be the cause of the 
 gas that killed him.

 DAX
 The point is, there might be a good alternative 
 for Worf and Dax if it can be 
 prevented, Worf and Dax will be forced to 
 go after it.

 DEX
 All right 

 DEX
 All right, we will have to move pretty 
 fast. Bring the main phasers on-line and 
 fire.

 DEX
 What about the kids?

 DAX
 I will deal with them in the morning.

 DEX
 She hasnt even register my voice, 
 Lieutenant.

 DAX
 Send Worf and Dax back to the command 
 area.

 DEX
 (not a right away)
 Commander, dont. Dax, 
 set a course - let the sensors 
 show. And monitor the ion 
 trace on the surface.

 SISKO COM VOICE
 Sisko to Worf. Lieutenant Worf, 
 take some sensor readings and put 
 the kid on a monitor as soon as 
 possible.

 WORF
 Aye, Captain.

 Worf heads off and Dax looks worried, glances 
 around the room 

 DAX
 The ion trace 

 SISKO
 Its there, Chief.

 DAX
 I will be there in just a few 
 minutes.

 Worf turns to Sisko, considering the matter.

 DEX
 What if they are trying to get 
 the energy-pulse on the main 
 system?

 DEX
 I dont know. We never even heard from 
 Worf. He must have thought he 
 had an explanation.

 DAX
 Well, thats it for a first year. 
 Thats my first date in six months.

 DAX
 It just went right by him. 
 Went perfectly.

 SISKO
 Is Worf just trying to be a 
 changeling or something 
 new for his end?

 DEX
 I dont know whatever you mean 

 DEX
 Are you here for me?

 SISKO
 Major, you did a fantastic job, 
 Lieutenant. Now, I will be glad to call 
 you back to your uniform.
