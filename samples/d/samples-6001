======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 never at all of you 

 The two men glare at each other, no one even 
 could face the possibility that both of them could know they 
 could both be sharing this same moment. Then 

 KIRA & WOCCUP

 Odo says a comforting goodbye to Kira and 
 Odo at that moment - as Worf prepares to turn 
 down his family honor.

40 INTERIOR DEFIANT - ENGINEERING

 On Kira, who nods in approval at Worf and Odo.

 WORF 
 (showing her the ring) 
 A gift for you the respect you 
 wish for this family.

 A beat Odo nods, then 

 ODO
 Thank you.

 Kira nods, then 

 KIRA
 Take care of that.

 KIRA
 I will put it through to your list.

 She moves to him with a firm, confident voice.

 KIRA
 You never did have these rings 
 on your list, do you?

 WORF
 The truth is, I have to take them 
 back.

 Odo is silent.

 ODO
 I dont want to go back. It felt 
 too much trouble.

 Kira nods, and moves off at a workstation. Worf 
 waits, and he moves slowly to do what he could.

 WORF
 I will make it in a couple of 
 hours with your 
 transfer.

40 CONTINUED (2)

 KIRA
 I just wanted to tell you how
 much I miss you today.
 (a beat) 
 And in a way I know you 
 will always be with us.

 She turns and leaves. Odo looks to Kira 
 and Odo, wanting to talk to him.

 ODO
 Tell me 

 KIRA 
 I have been in Starfleet awhile. 
 But Im like, I just missed 
 the whole thing. I have been 
 in Starfleet too long. I dont 
 have the sense of the rush 
 of my life.

 Odo and Kira exchange a silent, somber moment then 
 Odo nods.

 ODO
 When are we ready?

 KIRA 
 I think we can be very 
 lucky.

 Kira acknowledges.

 ODO 
 Good luck.

 KIRA
 A lot of people are 
 waiting to see you.
 (a beat) 
 But you just have to know 
 you have to take a chance. In the 
 end Im not 
 capable of playing the games.

 He realizes that Kira is right, nods its 
 best for her to take.

 ODO
 I know what Im doing here you 
 know what you must get to know.

 He tries to put himself under Kiras gaze, tries to turn 
 her face away. She breaks his heart, says the only 
 thing she wants to tell him that it is real 

 KIRA 
 I know.
 (a beat then 
 softly) 
 How I have been here a 
 long time. I remember my 
 shipmates the only one 
 who could be trusted. I dont know 
 how easily anyone asks 

 ODO
 All right, then, you have to be 
 that kind of selfish, and Im 
 not.

 Kira shakes her head in exasperation, but shes 
 saying it all.

40 CONTINUED (3)

 KIRA 
 Do you know why you have to be in 
 Starfleet?

 ODO
 No 

 He says her right now.

 ODO 
 Of course you do. The military, 
 the security protocols are all the same. 
 Why? Why would the station 
 and I want to join Starfleet?

 KIRA
 (gently) 
 Then why do you need to be in Starfleet? 
 You can help me take a good 
 look around this place.

 Odo is quiet.

 ODO
 (gently)
 Please.

 She turns and moves away.

 ODO 
 But I have gotten to do this. I 
 have waited too long. Im not ready 
 for duty.

 She makes eye contact with him, leans closer.

 ODO
 But you have to do it.

 Her eyes flutter - OBrien, Joran, Ral, Dax -
