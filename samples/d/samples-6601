 not and
 have to go through with these conversations with 
 everyone else.

 SISKO
 It looks like a lot of work.

 SISKO
 Are you all of it, Chief?

 OBRIEN
 Id like some more help.

 SISKO
 Chief - whats your status?

 OBRIEN
 I think I will have to get this day started.

 SISKO
 (to Nog)
 Hows the Chief?

 OBRIEN
 (to Sisko)
 I can have used a form I will let 
 you know as soon as possible. I will be 
 adding some details to the 
 paperwork.

 SISKO
 Good work, Chief.

 OBrien smiles and looks over at his wife.

58B CONTINUED

 OBRIEN
 You are good.

 SISKO
 And theres another one, too. OBrien 
 says I helped him because 
 (look at Jake)
 Thats all I have.

58B CONTINUED (2)

 OBrien looks over Siskos eyes and gives a proud nod.

 OBRIEN
 Well, Im not that bad and 
 am I bad. Its a game that keeps you 
 up all night every night.

 Sisko smiles at OBrien and smiles back. The moment that 
 is most definitely the most awkwardest conversation in 
 Bajor, takes all the wind.

 SISKO
 Is there anything else?

 OBrien takes a moment, then gives Sisko a small nod 
 and he turns away. He moves back to 
 chat with Sisko a few more times. Siskos 
 not interested in explaining just what he 
 was.

 SISKO
 So how did it feel to be 
 destroyed?

 OBrien shakes his head sadly. I dont 
 know.

 SISKO
 (very gently)
 So it felt like being 
 crushed. You lost. And thats good.

 A quiet moment. Dax looks over at Sisko. She knows he 
 needs her guidance, but she doesnt know just how she will 
 put it.

 DAX
 You have been very helpful.

 SISKO
 Very very helpful.

 A moment between them, then Sisko takes it one 
 bit seriously, theres no word for "I know" and Jake is 
 not very sure.

 JAKE
 I didnt think maybe you would get 
 at least the way I behaved, 
 or even have a part 

 SISKO
 Maybe.

 JAKE
 Yeah.

 Sisko looks back at Jake and shakes his head, not 
 sure whether to give him a nod or it. 
 Jake shrugs his head sadly. Its all very real to 
 him.

58B CONTINUED (2)

 SISKO
 I just wanted to be sure.

 JAKE
 I thought it wasnt so bad to 
 see me.

 Sisko is very uncomfortable, and its clear that hes 
 struggling.

 SISKO
 I tried to tell you.

 JAKE
 No. It had to be the way it was. 
 It wasnt. But its hard to think of 
 a game I cant begin to 
 remember.

 Sisko can just see that JAKE isnt 
 satisfied by that explanation, and in that moment, 
 Jake will begin to remember all about them all.

 JAKE
 I didnt have to. Its not like 
 we werent competitors.

 SISKO
 It doesnt look so good to talk about 
 you.

 JAKE
 I know. It feels 
 good to play.

 Sisko sits down, and the two men, both of whom 

 SISKO
 (sighing)
 Maybe Im going to play, too.

 including Worf, Dax, OBrien, Bashir, and Ezri as they 
 walk down the corridor. Dax is carrying Kajin, Bashir and Ezri 
 a medkit along with Bashir and Ezri.

 SISKO
 Is this really necessary?

 BASHIR
 Absolutely.
