======== SAMPLE 1 ========

 We can find out what went wrong soon. But for now, 
 I think your people would like.

 OBrien ENTERS for his shift and is met by a set of N.D.s. As he approaches Dax, 
 who checks her shoulder.

 DAX
 Hey, Miles, can I go carry my 
 test of the cannons?

 DEEP SPACE "Crossover" - 03/08/94 - ACT FIVE 55.

 OBRIEN
 Thanks, if youd like it.

 DAX
 Thank you, for everything. But 
 I am really having a hard time with those 
 cannons now. If youd just let me see 
 what happens when I see you at range, I will 
 have a runabout in a hurry.
 (beat)
 But you have your orders, Miles. You are to 
 cross-reference the Dakunta and Sakhath 
 and make certain they follow the right 
 route. Dax will cross if youd just leave 
 without me.

 OBRIEN
 No. You put all that on the 
 cross before I took the Dakunta down to 
 Bajor.

 DAX
 All I did was put them on a letter 
 once and a while.

 OBRIEN
 Thanks but, in the end, I was the one 
 who made that decision.

 A beat as they both ponder that, then.

 OBRIEN
 You were right about one thing thats 
 going to ruin this relationship 
 both of you. Both of you.

 DAX
 (beat)
 Thats not going to happen.

 OBRIEN
 Youd better think about it two 

 DAX
 (beat)
 No.

 OBRIEN
 And so its now both of you who are going to 
 ruin it.

 DEEP SPACE "Crossover" - 03/08/94 - ACT FIVE 56.

 DAX
 Wait a second, the people on the station are 
 going to ruin this relationship.

 OBRIEN
 But, just when they thought it would, they 
 knew it was either the same or bad. We 
 better both think about it than that.

51 EXTERIOR SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

 The Dakunta and the Maquis Raider both move toward the runabout. (Note All 
 Federation ships have a smaller, more colorful and colourful 
 uniforms.)

 KIRA (V.O.)
 Kira Nerys, OBrien and Nog. Half-empty 
 glasses of kanar litter the ground with kanar.

 A beat as OBrien and Dax absorb this.

 DAX
 What are these men just doing here?

 BASHIR (O.S.)
 Im afraid they have been 
 captured.

 They turn to see Bashir standing nearby.

 KIRA
 Julian. Dax, if you know me.

 DAX
 Everythings in your head seems to 
 be in the wrong place to be of 
 celebration or to private grands tournaments or 
 Delta games or A Kazon 
 War Game. You hear Garak telling 
 you to take the runabout and meet 
 OBrien on board.

 OBRIEN
 Just hearing Garak say that 
 so, I assume a celebration is 
 appropriate?

 DAX
 Correct.
 (beat)
 In honor of this occasion.

 DEEP SPACE "Crossover" - 03/08/94 - ACT FIVE 61.

 OBRIEN
 What a brilliant and unique opportunity 
 for Starfleet to celebrate?

 DAX
 Its just going to be different for 
 everyone that I am.

 Bashir moves to Dax and they walk off together, but 
 everyone is still going to be with Quark and Dax by 
 now.

 CUT TO

52 INTERIOR AIRLOCK CORRIDOR

 Quark and Dax are walking together. The look on Siskos 
 face is as if they both were just making preparations for a 
 trip to the holosuites.

 DEEP SPACE "Crossover" - 03/08/94 - ACT FIVE 62.

 KIRA
 I always knew they could get me up and back 
 later. Thats the way I am.

 Quark reacts.

 QUARK
 You expect me to get involved in an 
 official Starfleet event?

 DAX
 I know. But I thought wed 
 focus their attention solely on a 
 Starfleet vessel.

 QUARK
 You are going to get OBrien and Sisko 
 killed. So you are going
