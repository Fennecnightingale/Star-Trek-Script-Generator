 You know you will find a few things 
interesting.

 She smiles gratefully but knows full well that she 
is an intelligent, cunning, even 
wimpy, scheming woman with great 
influence and power. She looks at you with a 
wary grin, but doesnt want to provoke the 
Bardess at all.

 BAJORM
 You have got to be.

As much as you want me to 
be you in there somewhere 
and I get what 
I will do.

 The waiter glances at me, not sure what to do.

 BAJORM
 Why am I not interested in

 RIKER
 It matters to me.

 He smiles at her.

 As Riker finishes reading the script,

 Riker looks the other Ferengi to the
commander and exits.
