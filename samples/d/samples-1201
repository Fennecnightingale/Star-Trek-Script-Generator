REED Im not sure.
TPOL (OC) I cant get a transporter lock.

REED If you dont make it fast

(Beverly, he runs through the smoke)

REED I think the system has been activated.
TPOL Captain, I cant find an interface. Its almost impossible.

(Archer and Spock step inside the transporter room - they run the corridor to a corridor where the crew is hiding. He has a PHOT strapped over his shoulder. He then runs his hands over to Picard -

 TASHA This is a little more sophisticated than you think, but it is the same as you think. It doesnt matter too much.

 PICARD You can see the crew lying behind the bulkhead, but on the
 other hand, they are very careful not to look around. They dont even bother to glance at one
 another, which is what they were looking more than half a dozen years ago.

 PICARD You have a pretty interesting taste, I dont doubt
 it, Im sure they are just as smart as you are.

 PICARD You are looking pretty good for a man like you, then,
 what about the other crew?

 PICARD I really was thinking they were dumb.

 PICARD Theres something about them which got underlined by
 your attention.

 PICARD I was right.

 PICARD The crew have been hiding out in the smoke for years.

 PICARD Its not like this - they are quite willing to be pushed out even in the
 face of danger, and willing to get hit by a nasty photon explosion.

 The crew seem very confident in their chances, but we dont see why.

 PICARD You think theres danger?

 PICARD Theres another one in their shuttle. If we got out of orbit, we would be destroyed without
 us.

 PICARD That wont happen either. They have to be gone for three hours, so they can bring the
 rest of you (reacting to something on the far side of the bridge) then return
 to the shuttle.

 as they move to a station which has been badly damaged.

 WORF Two other ships could be heading toward us now.

 PICARD You are too far for us to catch them.

 The ship is in the clear lane, and we cant turn around. No one can do 
 for another.

 on one side of the station, a more formidable Klingon ship.
