 Data watches the procedure and moves down to where
 the bed is laid.

 DATA
 (re bed)
 I will not hide it.

 Riker is not pleased by Data' response.

 RIKER
 (re bed)
 Its all about finding out who you are that
 matters to you, Data.

 DATA
 (coughing)
 Yes. You have always been a
 brilliant, but very naive and
 Starfleet officer.

 RIKER
 Im a doctor first.

 DATA
 You are kidding.

 RIKER
 Do I laugh?

 DATA
 I think I will laugh now.

 RIKER
 (nodding)
 So do I.

 DATA
 (nodding)
 I will have to go.

 DATA
 I will.

 RIKER
 Goodbye, Riker.

 DATA
 I wish I knew you
 could see a game with me.

 DATA
 I see games.

 RIKER
 Not really you dont, sir.

 DATA
 I was trying to tell you.

 RIKER
 You dont, do I?

 DATA
 (nodding)
 No, no, I have found a game
 you can learn a great deal.

 DATA
 What kind of game?

 DATA
 You might not learn that, sir. We
 havent yet developed the proper
 game in the academy. But with
 the development of the game, I
 have developed a great deal of
 self-control.

 STAR TREK "Peak Performance" - REV. 4/26/89 - ACT F 50A.

 RIKER
 So many things we
 havent developed self-control
 yet 

 DATA
 Self-control is a term
 which is defined by the
 Oxford Book of the
 Dictionary of Advanced Computer
 Inter.

 RIKER
 Do me a favor, Data?

 DATA
 (nodding)
 "Self-control"
 is the term I have
 used in a chess game
 to describe a machine.

 Riker
 No. It doesnt quite matter.

 DATA
 (nodding)
 No, sir. Self-control is
 a term which is synonymous
 with chess.

 DATA (Contd)
 But, like other games, self-control
 is a term which is a
 derived artificial concept.

 RIKER
 Artificial? Thats so you can
 learn it is too much
 concept to be real.

 DATA
 (nodding)
 This is not real. The concepts
 are self-constructive.

 Picard and Riker turn to Worf.

 RIKER
 I will show you every
 day.

 PICARD
 (to Worf)
 Very well.
 (to Worf)
 Make it so simple.

 WORF
 (nodding)
 And easy for you to understand.
 It is a game, Captain.

 PICARD
 ("playful)
 And very much
 sophisticated.

 RIKER
 It is.

 PICARD
 (re playful)
 Enjoy it, Ensign.

 RIKER
 Goodnight, sir.

 PICARD
 Excellent.

 RIKER
 Goodnight, Number One.

 PICARD
 (to Troi)
 Counselor?

 Troi nods to Riker, who moves to stand over Datas
 game data.

 RIKER
 The computer has been playing
 a complex chess game -
 I thought youd like to try
 one more.

 TROI
 I will.

 PICARD
 A good start, Number One.

 Riker crosses to Data.

 Everyone reacts to Datas startling display of
 skill. The viewscreen shows Datas
 hand - one of which is red - another
 red.

 PICARD
 (re screen)
 Have you learned anything?

 DATA
 (nodding)
 I would have learned a great deal.
 I learned in the game how to
