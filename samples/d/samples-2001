55A INTERIOR KIRA HANDS

 The bird of Preyol is nestled in her hand. The

56 ANGLE ON THE BIRD OF PREYOL

 As the birds come back to their lairs.

 BIRD of PREYOL
 Our lord!

 KIRA
 Bring us to his sanctuary!

 BIRD OF PREYOL
 Forgive me!

 KIRA
 Come to his sanctuary!

 BIRD OF PREYOL
 Forgive my brothers!

 BIRD OF PREYOL
 Ah, my brothers!

 KIRA
 Ah, he must have left the 
 altar.

 BOWO
 Thats right. He flew into the 
 wormhole in another thousand years. 
 He must have entered that holosuite.

 Kira shakes her head, trying to concentrate on what 
 shes doing.

 BAJAKE
 (whispering)
 I dont remember. We only keep telling a 
 story to make it so.

 KIRA
 Thats not true, theres no reason 
 to tell me this, I know this is a very serious 
 crime. I dont know about to tell anyone.

 The other two Bajorans look at this, unsure about to 
 take in the implications of what they are saying. Kira 
 turns to him, tries to focus on a solution.

 BAJAKE
 We can keep him in here.

 KIRA
 Let him out, and let him know that. But 
 only for a few minutes.

 BAKE
 All right!

 Odo is standing in an empty corner, barely able to see

 about her.

 (softly)
 I dont have to do this.

 KIRA
 Not now.

 will fly out of its cage and fly away. He falls to his knees.

62 INTERIOR BARROW

 Jake is standing in the bower.

 JAKE
 (quiet)
 Jake, can you hear me?

 ODO
 (calling)
 Jake!

 Jakes ears turn to look at him.

 ODO
 Jake!

 Jakes ears are startled. And they close quickly.

 ODO
 It must have been here for ten years 
 ago.

63 ON WORF

 He catches his eye and turns to see the bird. Worf looks up from
