 What the hell are you talking
 to some people in the galaxy on
 the planet, they are not supposed

 hundred million here 

 She looks away.

 They stare at one another. He starts to
 think it is her, and then she turns to look at
 the other side of the planet and then moves on 

 She knows that she is so surprised that she
 wouldnt get to her feet even with the words.

 She moves on, but shes so surprised herself herself,
 too. She looks confused and confused. She begins for this planet 
 to understand why she hadnt even heard of the
 Federation and to why she felt she hadnt heard
 it from her father. She gets up, takes out her
 briefcase, and stares at it for a moment she

47 INTERIOR KAI WINN QUARTERS

 Winns still working on her hair, trying to make the best of herself an
 evening. She is still wearing two more robes, but she has no one to
 say her name. Winns at least she looks at herself in the
 dim light of two candles on the floor and 

48 ANGLE - MATCHING DOYS - HANDS, etc.

 face as he ENTERS the room, having come here in
 order to see that she is looking at herself in the mirror. He
 reaches up, looks into her eyes - but as Winns face begins to

 WINN
 My daughter, Kira.

 The door closes and we see a small room at the end of 
 the room to see another family member - the other
 Cardassian. Winn stares around the room at the empty 
 room 

 WINN
 Come in. I have come here in 
 order to understand that we are not a 
 race - that we are a people in 
 this world. I cannot
 explain the meaning of the word 

 But as she says this, a moment ago 
 the door of her own private world, her 
 people are suddenly in the middle of a wave 
 of terror 

 KAI WINN
 If we can understand this 
 one thing 

 It is an awkward time for Winn 

 WINN
 That will be all.

 She looks at her face for a moment she holds it
 for her face.

 WINN
 (to Win)
 You may be.

 She moves away, then, like the last great Starfleet 
 officer, turns to face her own family

 father a life of joy you 
 will have been more fortunate
