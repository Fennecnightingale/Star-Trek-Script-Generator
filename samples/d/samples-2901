 Picard is on the prowls, and in one hand, the
 Enterprise is on the computer screen.

 STAR TREK "The Next Phase" - REV. 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 43.

46B ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

 The ship is on the bridge where shes on. The
 ship is almost completely SOLAR GREEN - but at least
 on the pilot, which is in good health.

 RIKER
 Our escort mission is to infiltrate enemy
 fleet in preparation to beam back
 the prisoners to the
 shuttle.

 Worried chatter, Picard is on the move. He
 hesitates, hesitated, and
 hes the man behind the ship.

 Picard
 (smiles)
 A shuttle pilot, Captain.
 (beat)
 No, I will prefer a
 shuttle. Id like to
 discuss it at Enterprise
 Command on our way.

 Picard nods, pleased, and nods to Riker.
 Riker is already on the ship, moving to one side.

 RIKER
 (re the
 shuttle)
 The last thing I said, Captain,
 they are not prisoners. Their
 weapons arent functional, sir.

 Picard considers him for a beat, nods in
 response. He moves to the
 screen and it shows a STARSHIP MAIN VIEWER which
 allows Picard to use whatever he wants
 to look out.
 We will also see a large cruiser.

47 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

 The Enterprise is on a mission.

48 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

 Picard, Picard, and Riker react, as Picard and Riker beam
 in again. In one hand, they are ready to take command of the
 Enterprise and to carry out Picard and Riker.

 STAR TREK "The Next Phase" - REV. 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 44-45.

 DATA
 Captain, it appears my
 vessel may not be as well as
 Captain.
 (proud)
 You are correct, Captain.
 What are you doing on Tetryon
 Four.

 And Picard takes this in, but he wont
 allow himself to act like a foolishman - as Riker asks

49 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

 A large cruiser looms close.

 Picard is
 about to answer, Data. But
 Picard looks back to the viewer, pulls back.

 DATA
 We are approaching starboard,
 sir.

 Picard looks puzzled and puzzled, then
 moves to the screen to the nav.

 DATA
 Sir, my vessel appears to be
 responding.

 Picard hesitates. It appears to be responding with
 his vessel.

 RIKER
 (proud)
 Its Captain. I should beam
 aboard and take over my ship at the
 helm.

 STAR TREK "The Next Phase" - 7/9/89 - ACT FOUR 46.

49 CONTINUED

 DATA
 That is not possible.

 RIKER
 No.
 (beat)
 Youd never tell me that.
 (pausing, hard to get to
 the ship to change)
 I am Sir Paul Tardy, I
 dont know.

 The ship is suddenly ROCKED HARD. An N.D.
 Klingon warrioress appears on the bridge. Riker is
 at Tactical, Geordi at Ops, and Wesley is
 at the helm. The ship is CROSSING with
 the starboard of a huge space anomaly.

 Picard looks over at the viewscreen, but theres
 nothing he can do from his position.

 DATA
 That is the Enterprise.

50 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

 The warship is approaching from Starboard. Picard
 quickly moves to the helm and
 takes command.

 DATA
 Captain, we are nearing starboard
 again.

 Picard doesnt respond, just stands and
 waits. Suddenly the ship is suddenly
 THROUGH the bulk of the ship, speeding a
 little slowly.

51 ANGLE AGAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

 The starboard bridge is docked. This is a
 familiar Starboard. Picard looks over
 to Riker and Troi at his post.

52 BACK TO MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

 The warship now moves to the starboard side
 of the ship. Picard is standing on a
 side viewout. Picard watches the starboard
 side of the Warrioress for a beat,
 watching her carefully.

53 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

 Picard and Riker react. Both are
 reacting to the sight of
