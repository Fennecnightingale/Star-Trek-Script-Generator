 PENNING
 Sir ?

 RIKER
 (to Worf)
 Get me the tricorders. You will
 find nothing.
 (to Riker)
 Doctor Crusher, will you?

 WORF
 The tricorder had no
 malfunction. I detected no residual
 particles, no residual energy,
 nothing but a residue of
 something resembling
 the iranogenetic agent.

 RIKER
 You are saying hes right. Now
 we have to find a way to stop him.

 PENNING
 There isnt enough time. I will
 have to run several micro-cellular scans.
 It will take some time, but I will
 have to save the ship.

 RIKER
 We cant let him die.

 GEORDI COM VOICE
 Releasing the containment field.

 Reactions.

 PENNING
 Shut down life support.

 Reactions.

 PENNING
 Oxygen saturation.
 (to Worf)
 Mister Worf, prepare to transport
 me 
 (and Geordi)
 Aye.

 She works. After her work, her face darkened - she
 looked very frightened.

 GEORDI
 This isnt how I look forward to
 meeting this new species.
 (beat)
 But I might not be about to
 stop a doctor for another six hours.

 And she falls silent.

 PENNING
 It was necessary to render
 unconscious at the
 time of the accident 

 She looks at him with new urgency and we -

 DISSOLVE AT THE AN ALCOVEAN ON A MONITOR

 A grey line begins to display across the ship at the
 lab table. There is an ALIEN VESSEL on a wall that is
 moving up to its top.

 Beverly and Worf react to the strange development.

 PICARD
 Mister Barclay?

 BARCLAY
 (off console)
 it appears that hes right, Captain.

 GEORDI COM VOICE
 No, no, Commander. The containment
 force would have disintegrated when it
 was exposed to the tetryon field.

 BARCLAY
 A tetryon field? What is it?

 GEORDI
 Im not sure, but in the meantime,
 the xenopolycythemia would have
 dissipated and I would have been
 able to have escaped.

62 CONTINUED (6)

 Picard considers, waits for the Vulcans to make the
 decision for themselves. Barclay moves to him, speaks without
 opposition. He speaks to them in an almost casual manner of an individual-
 someone whos come to "clues" in their quarters 

 BARCLAY
 He seems to have gotten into the
 Transwarp core. He
 has locked onto us.

 PICARD
 Thats because he believed we would
 get to save him after the
 accident. Isnt he? Because if the
 containment fails, who
 will he be able to leave?

 BARCLAY
 I cant tell you, Captain. I am
 thinking about a way to find you
 and then Captain, we
 should fight back. Maybe,
 we could find a place to start
 - a place to survive the
 accident. A place to start -

 Picard considers.

 PICARD
 Lieutenant, I want to keep you safe -
 dont kill him.

 BEVERLY
 (interrupting)
 We cant just let a murderer
 go to jail.

 Picard pauses for a moment

 PICARD
 And you, Doctor, will be free to
 die 

 They look at him for a long moment. He
 looks at her, makes his decision. He reaches
 for her hand - hers completely hands the
 matter.

 PICARD
 (continuing)
 in that case, Doctor.

 As the two men turn to leave -
