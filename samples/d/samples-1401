======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 two
 shuttle should hit the Earths crust.
 It should create a huge volcanic eruption in the
 air, similar to the one we were
 looking forward to.

 Data moves his hands to the console and begins working. Data
 and Troi react with relief and excitement.

 DATA
 Sir?

 Riker begins to move and Data works the console.

 DATA [O.S.]
 Commander Riker, you are
 in a very unfortunate circumstance.

 Data gets into the shuttlecraft. Picard glances
 down at this one.

 PICARD
 If I were there, Id say our odds were
 not in our favor.

45 CONTINUED (3)

 PICARD (Contd)
 In that case I feel very good about them
 because they are almost certain.

 PICARD
 (beat)

 Picard nods and moves toward the shuttlebay door.

46 INTERIOR MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

 As before, only the shuttle is on the screen.

48 INTERIOR SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)

 Riker and Troi react with relief as Riker glances
 at one of the two shuttlecraft being used by two
 shuttle captains.

 DATA
 Captain that one will be destroyed
 to the Earth 

 PICARD
 That one will be destroyed as well!

 STAR TREK "Masks" REV. 12/20/90 - ACT FIVE 53.

48 CONTINUED

 WESLEY
 Is that a necessary
 condition?

 RIKER
 Yes, Mister Riker, you must
 accept the fact that they are almost
 as certain as you are that
 you have to accept that we will all get
 what we come here to get.

 RIKER
 (beat)
 And to be accepted as you are. How does
 we do that?

49 INTERIOR TROI QUARTERS

 Troi turns suddenly from her pagh 
 and we cant know where shes gone, but we
 cant stay here without them, and
 after a beat it seems that
 we may have done the exact same thing.

 TROI
 (beat)
 Why were the two shuttleboys chosen to die
 as well?

 RIKER
 I was in a shuttlecraft that
 was out there. I made an
 honest mistake. We killed everyone
 they cared about.

 TROI
 But we were in a shuttlepod you
 know - you had your orders and
 your crewmen, all of them,
 your men, but even you
 wouldnt have
 believed it would work 
 with us!

 RIKER
 (beat)
 I do do know the right thing to do as
 Commander Riker says.

 TROI
 And Commander Rikers orders are not
 you to follow.

 RIKER
 Then whatever you said on the
 planet.

 TROI
 I guess he only wanted it to
 be me who was left to say that we had
 the weapons of the first
 word "already" left to say that we were all
 just being an accessory to murder and a killer
 is only a killer 
 a killer.

 STAR TREK "Masks" REV. 12/20/90 - ACT FIVE 54.

49 CONTINUED

 RIKER
 And he thought thats enough and that he
 would kill any
 human that confronted us again 
 at the first sign of
 what would destroy and
 never get the means of life in
 his hand again

 as it fires on the shuttle.

 FADE OUT.

 ACT FOUR 

 FADE IN

39 INTERIOR BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

 Riker steps up to Troi and Troi seems
 as though she could hear the message on Data.

 TROI
 Thats right. All Federation vessels are
 locked in.

 RIKER
 We are evacuating Cardassia.

 TROI
 (beat)
 This is a direct attack on
 Cardassia and not an
 attack.

 RIKER
 I know what the message on Data is about -
 its about a direct
 attack on Cardassia 

 TROI
 The Bajorans know. He knows where
 those attacks will take
 them. He knows that the
 destruction of their
 homeland could kill
 them all 

 RIKER
 We have to stop them - we have to
 stop them until we can talk
 again.
