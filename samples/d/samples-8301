 are 
 going to be alright.

 Sisko reacts, looks into her eyes - shes 
 not sure hes the only one upset she could still be a 
 part of it, but she nods, and he settles into 
 a long, warm kiss.

 DUKAT 
 I will be a part of you, will 
 never be your sister.

 KIRA
 Dont be your sister. You should be 
 at your core, Deanna.

 Sisko is swept away.

 DAX 
 I hope theres something you need 
 from me.

 Sisko stops himself, trying to focus on the 
 moment.

 SISKO
 As my father. I was raised 
 by Starfleet officers to
 protect small towns from the 
 Koralis system. I knew the 
 fear was very strong, but 
 there was something about you 
 you I know you have had to get 
 used to life. And I wanted to 
 keep an eye on you.

 SISKO
 Im going to miss.

 DAX
 (wryly)
 I always hope for you to come 
 back, Benjamin. But in the
 end you have got more going on 
 already. With Starfleet now 
 command of your own 
 Klingon Empire, you have had 
 to get used to getting caught up in 
 bloodthirsty wars among 
 Klingons. And now Im 
 going to lose the Empire.
 (a beat)
 What will you always be its 
 always Starfleet,
 Benjamin?

 Siskos answer is firm and strong, but he doesnt 
 give in to Daxs confident voice.

 SISKO
 You are welcome, Adira.
 However, somethings still going 
 on between us. You can
 start a new life for me.

 Dax nods, and Sisko steps to resume the kiss.


 SISKO
 Id love to return, but Im not 
 sure I can.

 Siskos expression fades to one of deepening and 
 resigned regret.

 SISKO
 I look forward to it.
 (a beat)
 We are going to miss our home, and we 
 will be together again, but not 
 for a long time.

 DEEP- You in Astrometrics lab.

 SISKO
 I cant just let you get back in
 there.

 But Sisko is determined not to let Dax get back in the 
 way.

 SISKO
 No.
 (beat)
 We have to go home.

 And this is the only way Sisko can be a part 
 of your life again.

 SISKO
 I dont think I can help you, 
 nor I can let you go in to
 one of the Klingon ships.
 (a beat)
 We are all going to miss home.

 Dukat watches with deep uncertainty. He steps closer and 
 looks at Sisko.

 DUKAT
 If I go back, nothing will ever
 hurt me.

 Sisko cant argue with Dukat for much longer.

 SISKO
 Dont do this, Dukat.

 DUKAT
 Thats what I wanted to say and
 I was never going to do it.

 SISKO
 (quietly)
 You wont regret this, will you?

 Dukat looks at Sisko for a beat, and knows that 
 Sisko is his commanding ship. How does Sisko 
 feel about Jadzia and the rest of my crew?

 SISKO
 Good.
 (after a beat)
 Lets make it look like we are going to be 
 traveling to the first new races in the 
 Klingon Empire. This will give us 
 a chance to establish 
 a new future that will bring us to 
 the station.
 (taps combadge)
 Sisko to Defiant.

 Dukat reacts in surprise and surprise.

 RIKER COM VOICE
 First Officers to Jadzia.

 SISKO
 Sisko, Dax and I are ready to jump.

 Sisko and his crew react and Siskos word begins to
