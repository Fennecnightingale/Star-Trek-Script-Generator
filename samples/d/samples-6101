 activates his communicator.

 INTERCUT

 Worf in the Infirmary.

 SISKO (V.O.)
 I need your help. We need to get
 there in the next ten minutes.

 WORF COM VOICE
 (V.O.)
 The hostages have been freed.

 Sisko reacts to the message, turns to Worf.

 SISKO
 Mister Worf.

 WORF
 Aye, sir.

 Sisko and Worf exchange a glance 

 SISKO
 On my way, Captain.

 And with that, Sisko and Worf exchange a look of
 closeness and as they step forward 

69 INTERIOR ODO QUARTERS

 Odo is still curled in his sleep, staring up at the
 Infirmary with his eyes still closed. As Sisko
 arrives

 My name is the Captain.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Covenant" - REV. 10/14/98 - ACT FOUR 49.

71 INTERIOR OPS

 Worf is working at his station, now appears to be
 working at his station.

 WORF
 The station is at least eight
 hundred light-years away.

 SISKO
 And the station is at least
 twelve light-years.

 WORF
 How did you get the location?

 SISKO
 (as she works)
 Using various computer
 interfaces and other
 methods.

 WORF
 Do you think the captain may
 have made an error?

 Sisko thinks.

 SISKO
 No.

 WORF
 Then it would seem he was less
 than ten hours that night.

 Sisko takes a beat to think, reaches to
 the terminal 

72 INCLUDE THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

 Where the Dynamic City, a small,
 eerily dark and ominous, hangs in the cosmic
 strings. (Coordinates 32, 34, 35, 36.)

 Sisko, Worf and Kira exchange a troubled look.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Covenant" - REV. 10/14/98 - ACT FOUR 50.

72 CONTINUED

 WORF
 This is your fault 

 Sisko seems to hear Odo say something in her mind,
 making a sudden entry on his computer
 monitor.

 SISKO
 That doesnt quite make it right
 now.

 WORF
 You dont understand, do you?

 WORF
 (beat)
 You dont want to risk my
 life for an error? You
 may turn off co-ordinates 

 WORF
 Why?

 WORF
 How many people have died
 on the station during
 the last ten hours?

 WORF
 How would you know?

 Worf moves to the window and considers.

 WORF
 Captain the graviton
 signatures are
 deteriorating Im
 unable to verify.

 Siskos ears slowly move. They are getting tired of this
 headache.

 SISKO
 They will get you something 

73 ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

 The cosmic strings appear in the viewscreen.
 Their burning energy rays glow faintly -
 purifying the windows as their souls try to
 breathe.

 WORF
 Why have you turned them
 on?

 SISKO
 They are trying to communicate
 with you. Its only
 a subconscious level.

74 ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

 Which shows an ENERGY BEAM capable
 of emitting an excess of
 neuro-transmitters.

 WORF
 What do you see in this
 sense? These energies
 are trying to communicate
 with you 

 SISKO
 (shaking his head)
 Its so beautiful somehow.
