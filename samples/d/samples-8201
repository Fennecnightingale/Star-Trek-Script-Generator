 as he reacts, amazed and curious.

 as he finally ENTERS from his Turbolift. The
 first thing he sees is a very old, very old
 HAND HAND HAND.

 PICARD
 Ah yes, Houd be surprised what
 happened? Was it a holographic
 simulation?

 HAND HAND
 What, HOLO-REED-HOLODECK/SHIP HOVERING
 HYPO. I dont understand.

 STAR TREK "Birthright" - REV. 10/16/92 - ACT FIVE 54.

 PICARD
 Did it have something to do with
 the Holodeck?

 HAND
 It was Holocators which created
 the Holodeck and allowed us to
 escape.

 PICARD
 But why take away the main
 holodeck?

 HAND
 We created the Holodeck for each
 of us with an average of two, we
 would say. And what was
 the real reason that
 my fathers never found the
 Holodeck?

 HAND
 We had killed by a Romulan
 animal.

 The holodeck is at the ready.

 PICARD
 (continuing)
 That is the real reason.

 The hall is filled with sadness and loss.
 Picard moves to the bridge, and the empty Bridge
 fills with an angry, if impassive Vulcan.

 SELA
 Bridge - we have got lost our
 Romulan ship.

 HAND
 What difference does
 it make if we dont reach the
 Holodeck?

 Picard recognizes the gravity of these thought -
 what the captain is about to do.

 PICARD
 Unless all the systems on this ship
 are located within the Holodeck,
 must be maintained in a closed
 Holodeck.

 Picard moves toward the Commanders office.

43A INTERIOR MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

 Riker is at his station. The turbolift begins to close
 behind him.

 STAR TREK "Birthright, Pt. II" - REV. 11/04/92 - ACT FIVE 55.

43A CONTINUED

 BEVERLY
 This isnt going to help us,
 sir.

 DATA
 The artificial environment is
 replicating our Holodeck. If we
 attempt to leave Holodeck in a
 controlled environment -
 will no longer be the best quality
 of the Holodeck.

 RIKER
 Any suggestions?

 BEVERLY
 If we reconfigure a particle beam,
 and project Holodeck matter
 through narrow areas of the field, a
 simulated Holodeck bubble around the
 ship once inside the bubble would seal them.

 BEVERLY
 Wed better get to that on the
 main holodeck.

 She nods -

 WORF
 Holodeck is beginning to fluctuate.
 It is likely that Holodeck is
 running through Holodeck like a
 real Holodeck. It does not
 appear real to the Holodeck 

 Riker thinks for a few seconds.

 RIKER
 How long to the Holodeck,
 Ensign?

 WORF
 I am unable to leave Holodeck.

 The turbolift slows to a STOP and the lights DIM.
 The commanders office is full of smoke and smoke.

44 INTERIOR SELA CORRIDOR

 Outside the Commanders office.

44A ANGLE AT CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE CLUB

 The turbolift stops, reaches the ceiling and dips below
 the floor - filling the hallway with smoke.

44B RESUME SCENE

 As they lean on the floor and inch down inside the
 bulkhead.

 STAR TREK "Birthright, Pt. II" - 12/22/92 - ACT FIVE 56.

44C EXTERIOR SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

 The ship is at half-impulse.

45A INTERIOR MAIN BRIDGE

 At the Aft station. Red Alert lights
 FLASH ON.

 OBRIEN
 (off his console)
 The field emitted a beta wave.
 It is similar to the ones we saw in the
 holodeck, but is it easier to go
 after a more manageable piece of
 machinery.

 GEORDI
 Ensign Crusher - transfer the
 Holodeck to the Science Lab
 for a full diagnostic.

 The ship is LIGHTED.

 WESLEY
 Sir, that shouldnt be done. The
 Holodeck is designed to be
 simulated in much detail. Can we open
 that door?
