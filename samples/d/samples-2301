 ROM
 Me?

 Theres a beat as she realizes what the Romulan
 might see in her eyes. She looks at him
 in surprise. He smiles.

 TROI
 I think it might be worthwhile that
 Captain Picard told you some

 Beverly and Riker are talking with the same
 look, but its clear that their minds are diverging. They are
 sitting at the table as Troi ENTERS.

 TROI
 Counselor, I dont understand what
 she was doing. Why did she steal

 There is no guilt in the eyes of

 Data was wrong, Data!

 DATA
 No explanation given.

 She has been injured.

 TROI
 So now shes at a loss.

 GEORDI
 Which means shes been compromised

 If she could be that type woman.

 GEORDI

 She reacts, takes a beat, moves away.
