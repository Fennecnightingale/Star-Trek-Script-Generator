KIRK No; Wait! Let me do this! Let me! Do you hear me!

(Bridge)

SCOTT Captain, theres a voice from the ship!

(Bridge)

SCOTT Captain Kirk!

(Bridge)

MCCOY Well, I think we got the situation right, Captain. It is the voice from your vessel but it will take time for us to deal with it.

(Bridge)

SCOTT Let me beam up.

(Bridge)

SCOTT Energise. Energise. Aye, sir.

(Bridge)

SPOCK (OC) An entity appears to be destroying Enterprise, sir.

(Bridge)

KIRK The thing destroying the ship is a creature using the device on the ship, using our telepathic capacity as a hostage.

(Engineering)

MCCOY Thats correct, Captain. We cant afford to lose someone like the Enterprise for the rest of our life. Mister Scott, where are you going?

(Bridge)

PARIS Aye, sir.

(Engineering)

(Kirk is back in blue clothes.)

(Bridge)

(Scott is outside the room.)
SPOCK An entity is destroying Enterprise.
KIRK Get him out of there.
(They try to get through the bulkhead to the main bay.)

(Engineering)

TORRES The entity is deactivating the engines. We are approaching the energy threshold.
KIRK All right. Get ready to beam up.

(Bridge)

KIRK Stay with me, Mister Kim.

(Engineering)

KIRK Energise!

(Bridge)

KIRK Just a minute.
(The entity beams up.)
HOSHI They went out into the bulkhead.
KIRK Mister Sulu, maintain the distance from the bridge. Bridge, maintain the separation.

(Bridge)

SPOCK If it is the same thing you were about to do, Mister Spock, I have corrected the error in your logic subroutines. The information on the Captain was taken from his mouth.

(Engineering)

CHEY Come on. Come in.
(Uhura leaves.)

(Bridge)

SPOCK An entity has appeared to be killing Commander Spock.

(Engineering)

(The monster is a big, intimidating black square.)
SCOTT Captain, youd better get down here.
MCCOY It does indeed, Mister Spock, if you could just find it. Its a dead hulk.
(The big black square disappears.)

Captains log! Janice, whats wrong?
JANICE I dont know yet.

(Bridge)

KIRK The entity has disappeared, but I believe it has left us.

(Bridge)

SULU It is gone.

(Engineering)

(The monster has gone to the ship on the ship.)
KIRK The thing?
(The little pink light is squirtered, and the black dots get dark. So light goes dark.)
CHEY The creature! It is gone. It is inert.
KIRK Mister Sulu, whats our position?
SULU A position, sir, while the creature was moving at high warp.
KIRK We are safe. All is well, Mister Sulu. The creature! Its gone.
SULU The thing is gone, Captain. It has gone. It knows that it is gone, and it knows we are out.
MCCOY It feels like you know it is gone. It wants to go.

(Bridge)

KIRK This creature knows we must deal with the situation, but to do that, even though its not necessarily going in, is not enough. We will have to find someone. Someone human, a human bearing in blood.
CUT TO

(Engineering)

KIRK Im glad we found someone, Mister Sulu. I would have been proud of you, Mister Spock. I would have been proud of you, Mister Spock. Would you have made the planet a museum?
SULU Yes, I think so, Captain.

(Bridge)

KIRK Do you?
SULU Yes, sir.
KIRK Well, its about time. Mister Chekov, can you tell whats going on?
CHEKOV I, I cannot.
KIRK Hold on, Umura? I need the Spock voice we need to talk about. Come in on the Vulcan vessel, Mister Sulu. (into transmitter) Spock! Spock! Spock! Spock! Spock!
