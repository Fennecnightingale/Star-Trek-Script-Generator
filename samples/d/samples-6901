 Commander. You did not have 
 the last look at your son as 
 you looked at him when he 
 died.

 A beat. Riker glares at her.

 RIKER
 I knew hed come after me.
 (beat)
 I didnt want him going to die 
 so, I gave him a death look.

 DATA
 (beat)
 May I ask what you are saying ?

 RIKER
 You know my father the last thing he 
 saw was you. Hes a man who 
 refuses to be afraid to look what other 
 people in his lifetime have seen 
 in the last five years. Hes a man who 
 was forced to face his fears 
 in the dark.

 CUT TO

36 INTERIOR STATION CABIN 143

 Picard ENTERS a dark station where work is 
 being done. There are humans in the background -
 some of them work on their construction, others are 
 studying the daylights.

 Picard ENTERS from a turbolift. His tone is 
 disturbing. Hes a little disturbed by the sudden 
 lack of light in his position, but he gets no response from
 his work.

 Picard ENTERS a quiet station where humans are 
 working. Picard looks around the room.

 PICARD
 (re workmen)
 Whats happening in here, Jim? Are
 you here to help us?
 You did this?

 STAR TREK "Disaster" - REV. 8/13/91 - ACT FOUR 49.

36 CONTINUED

 The workmen are a little disoriented by his sudden 
 approach. He stops when he sees the sight of
 a piece of work in its context.

 WORKMERS
 You have been in here awhile.

 PICARD
 Our friendship?

 Workmen are no different from them. They just stare at 
 Picard a moment, but his demeanor does seem a bit odd.

 WORKMERS
 No. You are not. We only want to help.

 PICARD
 We found an accident on our
 Holodeck. Your mother came
 to blame. She said she had found 
 a way to honor her memory.

 Workmen are not so sure of that.

 PICARD
 The way is clear.

 The workmen are stunned. They dont believe the stranger who 
 brought them is just suddenly back there. They turn to look back at 
 Worf and the young man in their uniform.

44 INTERIOR HOLODECK (OPTICAL)

 Picard is standing alone in the Holodeck, an empty Holodeck 
 spacefront open on the floor. Suddenly, OBrien is standing out of 
 the door.

 ODO (o.s.)
 Yes.

 Picard turns toward him.

 OBRIEN
 Captain. We have come for you. We 
 saw a little girl.

 Picard sits down and looks up. He smiles as he sees 


45 NEW ANGLE

 Revealing that a copy of OBrien is sitting on the 
 bed next to his uniform. This is the look he was 
 thinking about. He turns to look down at it, and 
 his hands are clasped across the 
 Holodeck floor. A moment later, Worf and the 
 guards become too visible to get a crowd of people 
 to follow what they have seen in the Holodeck.

 Worf or the guards appear, and the scene shifts back to 

46 INTERIOR DRAWING ROOM (OPTICAL)

 where Kirk is talking to Worf and the guard.

 KIRK
 Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Our mission is the 
 first one to justice the suffering and 
 destruction that mankind has 
 endured. We give ourselves the opportunity to 
 allow those suffering and destruction 
 to be for one benefit. We strive for it 
 continuously
