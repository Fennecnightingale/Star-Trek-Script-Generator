 I isnt your target, sir.

 WORF
 (shocked)
 You are not your target?

 PICARD
 Only your target has a name.
 We chose you for the food we
 delivered him, and you are gone.
 Why?" How do you know?

 WORF
 We knew the demon would get us.
 He could have stolen our food
 in an incident, making a
 meal in his place.

 RIKER
 Worf - where are we going?

 WORF
 I will explain. But first, please,
 let your mouth off the matter.

 PICARD
 (to Worf)
 We cant afford to die in front
 of your mirror - if you dont mind.

 WORF
 If we are going to be able to find,
 you may. Thats exactly what makes
 it so terrible. We are not
 going to give up.

 Worf takes a step near his mirror, then stops.
 He doesnt look hard enough. Picard gets up and
 moves away.

87 WORF

 Just stunned as he takes a step towards his mirror.
 He cant believe its right - he lets out a long
 breath, then turns.

89 RESUME

 PICARD
 Mister Worf - if I can come out
 of this, we will discuss such
 a treaty.

 WORF
 Captain - I must object.

 Picard puts a hand to his mirror and gives the
 resulting light and the shadows of the past
 place - and all is gone.

 WORF
 I understand how tedious the
 burden of command can work
 in a continuous and 

 Picard lifts his mirror, in the rest.

 PICARD
 Your life - your entire
 life that will depend on it.

 Worf absorbs this for a moment. He is now
 looking at the future. For him.

 WORF
 You will live out your life on
 this bridge - with many
 other officers in your employ.
 But you will be unable to
 leave the Enterprise if you
 must know, I cannot do that
 either.

 PICARD
 Your life - as long as
 it may - is yours. Your
 decision to the present is
 final.
 (a beat)
 Your service is over.

 He turns and EXITS.

91 ON WORF

 He stands looking out of a window at the lights in the
 future.

 WORF
 What shall we say about this?

 THERE is a slight, as the future begins to
 take him on the spot in front of his eyes.

 WORF
 I shall stand beside you and
 salute 

 A beat as he stares thoughtfully into those
 eyes for a long time.

 Picard puts one final hand on Worfs
 shoulder as we

 The ship is moving slowly in a circular holodeck-like in the
 middle of a circle - the bridge is now complete.

95 INTERIOR TRANSPORTER ROOM

 The Transporter is operating well
 for the Klingons now. Everyone is back to the
 normal, except Worf, who stands a little
 further away. As the away team moves onto the
 bridge, Worf stands a little closer to the
 front. He takes a step toward the
 away team.

 WORF
 You are far better off than
 you were earlier, Captain.
 (to Picard)
 If any of the Klingons do not
 stand up - I will destroy
 them.
