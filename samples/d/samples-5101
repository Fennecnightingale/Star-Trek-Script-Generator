 she can to you.

 BASHIR
 Exactly. Your Eminence
 Lorby you are a most special
 man 

 GOWRON
 And most special man. You
 admire what they have to hold and
 cherish.

 Our one chance to reclaim
 the Celestial Temple. Our only hope
 is our priest, Eminence
 Sito.

 BASHIR
 My people the Prophets?
 (laughing)
 Well to speak like this will
 be almost as good.

 GOWRON
 Im sure your Eminence will
 be very proud of you. And
 you will benefit greatly from
 it. In the short term, I
 predict that our people will be
 able to reclaim the Celestial
 Temple.

 BASHIR
 But it wont take long to
 find a suitable site.

 GOWRON
 The Celestial Temple. Its here at the
 mouth of the Ariana System.
 Its the only place in the
 Ariana System that they can be
 in short term when they are
 rebuilding. I assure you,
 Admiral, you will be
 the first senior officer
 on this ship.

 Gowron moves to a console and begins working
 something.

 Worf is on the second of this after the battle as Bashir
 and Garak ENTER the scene, respectively, take their
 stations.

 Klingon Log. Supplemental.
 Commander, you wouldnt be
 wise to take that Klingon 
 destroyer out of your way?
 Mister Sito 
 (as he turns to work, off
 a Klingon monitor)
 Your relief, Lieutenant.

 Sito at Ops and her monitors move closer to him.
 Worf realizes that Sito might be trying to be hiding behind.

 WORF
 Mister Sito, its good to have you
 here, Commander.

 SITO
 Worf ?

 WORF
 I have assigned quarters here to
 lieutenants.

 SITO
 Worf?

 WORF
 Right away.

 Worf makes one last check on the monitor. He doesnt.

 WORF
 Computer, display security containment
 containment field for your Klingon
 engineer and Mister Garak.

 The Klingon computer screen is DISPLAYING on the control
 board. (NOTE its containment field is
 not on the same security level as the one in Ops.
 Klingon writing with one or two words
 are clearly marked with numbers, symbols and numbers.) WORF
 (continuing work)
 I have isolated a three Klingons
 who are secretly working
 in the cargo Bay. I have
 locked them out of the Brig with
 two Klingons who are working
 on the construction of a
 base to the JemHadar. If
 they are going to be here, our
 security protocols should be
 neutralizing those Klingons.

 BASHIR
 Lieutenant Sito, that would make
 a dull ride home.

 Thats why Garak, rather than look
 at the display on the wall monitor.

 GARAK
 Thats right. We have to
 get out of here.

 He EXITS. Worf watches him go, then moves
 over to the Klingon and the female Romulan
 working on an open panel. As he goes to
 the two Klingons working on the
 other panels, he notices that the Klingon
 guards with phasers on a stand back
 in the center of the
 bay.

 WORF
 (to the Klingon
 sergeant)
 Take action.

 The Klingon, now Garak, moves over to the
 wall monitor which has a small diagram of the ship. Both
 Klingons move into it as Worf watches.

 GARAK
 If you order me not to
 disrupt this mission, I will
 confiscate your ship and your
 officer involved in the
 exchange.

 Worf looks around at the wall monitor, the Klingon guard
 remaining nearby in the bay.

 WORF
 That isnt right. The Klingon
 Empire is on the run. You are
 the one who called themselves Klingon
 Legion 

 Worf stares at Worf for
