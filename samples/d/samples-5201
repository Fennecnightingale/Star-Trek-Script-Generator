EM
 (to Kira)
 Major, you need to get me 
 here in one hour.

 KIRA
 Right you are in her quarters, sir. 
 If youd like to deputize him, you 
 need to leave him alone.

 Kira EXITS.

 KIRA
 What do you think? I havent seen 
 YPora anywhere for ages.
 (to com)
 Computer, increase difficulty. It will increase 
 to fifteen pounds.

 Off Kiras face as she knows what to say.

 CUT TO

39 INTERIOR JEMHADAR SHIP CORRIDOR

 as Kira ENTERS and grabs the tube to use as it 
 accesses it to her phaser, quickly works the panel 
 for a beat, then another set of buttons and 
 a beat - this time no response. She looks like she might 
 have to kill to make a move forward.

 DEEP SPACE "Second Skin" - REV. 08/24/94 - ACT FOUR 49.

39 CONTINUED

 Another beat.

40 INTERIOR JEMHADAR SHIP CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

 Kira begins crawling across the corridor while an away 
 security guard escorts her, to one of the security guards.
 Off Kiras face as she catches up to someone 
 watching her 

41 INTERIOR CORRIDOR

 as Kira comes into a turbolift.

 KIRA
 Thats her. I will take you with 
 Major.

 KIRA
 If you will stay, you will be an old boy. 
 Its a good idea that Starfleet will 
 be trying to locate you.
 (beat to herself)
 And thats a lie 

 Kira continues walking down the corridor of a turbolift.

 CUT TO

 DEEP SPACE "Second Skin" - REV. 08/24/94 - ACT FOUR 50.

41A INTERIOR JEMHADAR CORRIDOR

 as Kira continues walking down the corridor. The guard is 
 watching and watching in a small b.g., as if this are 
 a part of his job.

 KIRA
 Well, I have a solution 
 to the problem 

 And off Kira and the security guards 
 moving toward a table or a similar, theres a 
 small bag packed on the floor nearby. Kira comes to a stop just inside 
 the door and the door opens as Kira ENTERS -

 KIRA
 Ooh.

 The door opens and Kira enters (her body smacks on the 
 panel).

42 INTERIOR JEMHADAR SHIP CORRIDOR

 As Kira emerges from the adjacent station as a 
 Security Guard joins her.

 KIRA
 How are you?

 SECURITY GUARDS
 I took heavy damage. 
 I suspect a phaser accident. 
 The restiers said 
 nothing except the damage suffered from 
 the battle and is continuing 
 to heal.

 KIRA
 Then someone took Kira 

 SECURITY GUARDS
 She was aghast, she could barely 
 speak.
 (beat)
 She loved the station as much as 
 me.

 A beat. Then the security Guard turns and 
 moves to stand directly in front of them.

 SECURITY GUARDS
 No one. What is it?

 KIRA
 They are closing on the surface. 
 They are digging a hole with a 
 metal panel and a few of the panels are 
 opening.

 SECURITY GUARDS
 (shaken)
 What are they doing?!

 DEEP SPACE "Second Skin" - REV. 08/24/94 - ACT FOUR 50A.

43 NEW ANGLE

 as Kira finds the panel opening and turns on it 
 from behind a back - its the same one Kira used to 
 open her panel and is again revealed as the Commander and 
 Counselor Deanna Riker.

 DEEP SPACE "Second Skin" - REV. 08/24/94 - ACT FOUR 51.

43 CONTINUED

 KIRA
 Commander.

 SISKO
 Yes are you all right, Major. But you 
 need to get me up to the air 
 soon.
 (to OBrien)
 Chief, contact Commander Riker, 
 and tell him this is Commander OBrien. 
 Its me.

 OBRIEN
 Aye, sir.
 (throws a heavy object on 
 the spot that we saw earlier in Act Two. 
 I also have another leak in the air which 
 could cause the panel to collapse. 
 Its also possible a plasma leak.

 SISKO
