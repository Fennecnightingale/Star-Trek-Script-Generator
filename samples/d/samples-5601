64 CONTINUED (4)

 Bashir turns to him.

 BASHIR
 I dont like to think about it. Thats 
 why I kept a folder on all 
 it, just so it could be safely 
 accessed.

 Bashir sees where Bashirs going, but 
 shes still lost. As Bashir works 
 this 

 CUT TO

64A EXTERIOR AERIAL PART OF WARREN ROOM

 Sisko, Kira, Bashir, Koval, FOUR N.D. BABS, and 
 other Starfleet personnel. For all intents and 
 weaknesses, I really really wanted to be 
 happy, but I guess all I 
 can do is wait for her.

65 EXTERIOR CHILTON PLANET - DAY

 Siskos sitting contentedly as Kira, then sitting in 
 his spot and staring out at the stars streaking 
 by.

66 INTERIOR KIRA QUARTERS

 Siskos sitting quietly looking at Kira with 
 the bottle of kanar beer that hes sitting 
 there. Just a few feet away, we HEAR the 
 SOUND of a door OPENING and 

67 ANGLE

 Sisko, Kira 

 Kira, Jake, Odo, OBrien 

 SISKO 
 Major, do you want to be 
 alone for a while?

 She isnt afraid of that, but she understands it. 
 They will keep each other here.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Chimera" - REV. 10/16/97 - ACT FIVE 50.

67 CONTINUED

 Kira is now lying awake just like the Kira 
 before. Shes staring at Siskos shoulder and 
 the bottle of kalmpebr and beeping from her lips.

 Kira 
 (defiant) 
 Well this is still a while 
 before I say its a good start 
 this new life 

 A beat as Kira looks over to where she is sleeping 
 peacefully.

 KIRA 
 (gently) 
 Dont be tired.

 SISKO
 (to Kira) 
 I have only been here so long for the 
 five hours the last few 
 hours of our lives a couple of 
 days, I think. I can still tell you we 
 have an excellent couple of 
 biotic years ahead that Im 
 not sure Im ever going down and it 
 feels like waiting for some 
 old man to blow up.

 Kira smiles sadly at this answer.

 JAKE 
 I guess so.

 And with that she closes her eyes and shakes her 
 head to clear the air. Siskos face 
 softens and he moves away she sits up. A 
 moment, then 

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Chimera" - REV. 10/16/97 - ACT FIVE 51.

67A ANOTHER ANGLE

 As the door OPENS to reveal the airlock RUITING 
 from a cloud of white goo into space.

 KIRA
 Wait ahead we are here 
 to find you.

 Sisko taps his combadge.

 SISKO
 (to com) 
 Computer, we are ready.


 A beat and the air finally comes out of the airlock.

 KIRA 
 I have thought of it.

68 INTERIOR TEN-FORWARD

 Sisko is sitting alone on the floor, 
 staring into space. Kira approaches.

 JAKE 
 I guess we are going to have 
 to talk.

 KIRA
 Why?

 JAKE 
 To know that Kira was 
 right.

 KIRA
 I know.

 JAKE
 (to com) 
 I guess we will be on the surface 
 for some reason.

 Kira nods and she moves off. Sisko stares off into space, 
 and before Kira can say anything 

69 EXTERIOR SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

 Tournamentship KEEPS, and we are OFF to an interesting 
 retirement.

70 INTERIOR RIO GROMEWAY

 Sisko is tapping some buttons on a console and he 
 we hear the SOUND of a door OPENING. Off reactions 

71 INTERIOR SECURITY OFFICE

 A few minutes later. CLOSE ON KIRA HAND as it OPENS and she 
 gets out into the hallway.

72 INTERIOR RUNABOUT

 As Kira (now on her back) ENTERS and crosses to the 
 Operations Table.
