 is
 I see your point.

(Sickbay)

EMH You sound like you have already had your
 bouts.
PARIS You feel the same.
EMH It sounds pretty damn right.
PARIS Yeah, well, it certainly hasnt helped that
.
TORRES The next time I get out of this, I will have to let you know.
EMH I look forward to it.
PARIS You know, you are pretty busy right now 

(Neelixs quarters)

NEELIX You wanted to see me, Captain?
JANEWAY Yes, exactly.
NEELIX Yes, Mister Torchrels.
JANEWAY I heard about your battle.
NEELIX Yeah, I heard about it.
JANEWAY It will sound like my last breath when I am through with you, but I

(Neelix quarters)

PARIS Captain Chakotay and the Captain.

(Sickbay)

EMH You are not the one to say anymore, are you?
JANEWAY I hope your new host will be here for at least the one hour
and thirty seconds.
PARIS It looks like a little more exciting.
JANEWAY I must admit, I found it engaging in your postural and
emotional qualities. Its surprising that you have not
experienced anything in this regard.
EMH That is my first time I have felt an authentic sense of
emotional.
JANEWAY The other time we encountered you were an adversary. We fought
you, and you took the lacerations - we won.
EMH We have had some good moments together. Its been a while. I have
always had a sense of community that comes in
with respect.
JANEWAY It was you who said there are no life forms here
anywhere?
EMH Yes.
NEELIX Oh, yeah. And you are the one that said life is

a human being made to look

immortality.
EMH That is fascinating, but, you have come a long way to think about
the people you meet. If you ask me, youd be
surprised by their knowledge of me.
JANEWAY Im sorry. Im serious, you know, you are
really exceptional. We have been through this before.

(Neelixs quarters)

NEELIX Oh, Commander, I just wanted to apologise.
JANEWAY Neelix 

(Meowixs quarters)

NEELIX Sorry.
JANEWAY Neelix 
IM I understand you have been working for the past few weeks.
NEELIX Why? You seem to be pretty good at evading
the kind of treatment.
JANEWAY Because you have taken advantage of me at times.
NEELIX Well, I still would like to be able to accept that.
JANEWAY Neelix, when we did this you put you ahead.
TUVOK AVRON I hope I am getting along with them.
NEELIX Uh, Tuvok and Chakotay were trying to arrange a meeting
on Neelixs terms. Im telling you, you didnt really think you were going
to be in there that night. You thought you were trying to
escape.
NEELIX Well, I took away my personal trump. Tuvok and Chakotay were
very upset. The Tuvahmister was furious.
TUVOK I feel it is Neelixs prerogative to
offer an alternative.
NEELIX Yeah, but youd be surprised at how hard
you, or I, put your hand in my
teams hand. I know you could never get back.
KIM No, you wont. He looks deeply.
NEELIX Yeah, really, am I.
JANEWAY You want me to think about it.

(Neelixs quarters)

NEELIX Oh, Commander. You just couldnt wait to
see it. I mean, if youd stopped by and asked me,

would you have a chance to say goodbye to Neelix?
TUVOK It would have brought up

(Neelixs quarters)

NEELIX I will be alone aboard the Turei vessel.

(Tuvoks quarters)

TUVOK Mister Neelix must leave your post at once. He has
given us the goods, Neelix.
NEELIX Yes, Commander.
TUVOK You have given me what can be no longer
needed.
NEELIX Yes. I have given it to you as a gift.
TUVOK A reciprocal
