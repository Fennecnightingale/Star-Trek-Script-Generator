 DEEP SPACE NINE - "Blaze " - REV. 03/21/97 - ACT FOUR 53A.

31 CONTINUED

 Koval and Bashir are about to exit.

 PORTA
 You all have something like that?

 BASHIR
 Of course I have a right to exist,
 Captain, but I have never sought one.

 PORTA
 Theres no point. You are not my
 wife.

32 TWO SHOT - SISKO

 as Rom approaches his mother.

 ROM
 (with a hint of pride)
 You are a woman?

 Sisko smiles.

 SISKO
 I hold myself together, you know.

 ROM
 (stunt)
 I dont think I want to marry my
 daughter, but after all, we have 
 had a lot to commiserate with, I 
 dont forget.

 SISKO
 That will be all.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Blaze " - REV. 03/21/97 - ACT FOUR 54.

32 CONTINUED

 As Rom bows his head in prayer before them.

 SISKO
 Kovath, Raimus, Beth 
 (with a smile)
 Lano kala Kosst Amojan, Pah-wraiths have 
 judged you. And you have 
 been chosen one of them.

 Bashir bows his head in prayer and then his body begins to 
 WIMMER at the same time Tekos appears. The crowd falls silent for a 
 moment, then comes together around Worf.

33 THE GROUP

 is back together again. Suddenly, the crowd is standing on 
 the platform. Before the main group gathers, Sisko walks 
 to stand in front of the gathering. He is addressing the group. 
 The crowd has gotten smaller and more boisterous as Dax 
 talks.

 DAX
 They demand that we - or some 
 other group - break off the 
 celebration and await new supplies.

 SISKO
 My, my, my only hope in this 
 is to unite the 
 people together in a new, 
 unified church here and 
 put an end to this gathering.

 DAX
 (incredulous)
 It would be great, you know.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Blaze " - REV. 03/21/97 - ACT FOUR 55.

33 CONTINUED

 SISKO
 All right, lets finish it. 
 (looking at the group)
 Lets all concentrate on their 
 task.

 Worf leads the group straight through the crowd, 
 looking like theyd be them. OBrien, Bashir and 
 Quark are among them.

 SISKO
 Once we assemble a great church, the 
 celebration is with us.

 They all EXIT except Worf, Quark, OBrien, Bashir, Odo, Quark,
 and OBrien. Sisko has a few more seconds before 

 After a few moments of this, Bashir is 
 alone in the crowd. The time is rapidly approaching.

 Suddenly he pauses on Dax. Bashir recognizes Jadzia - who is 
 sitting.

 DAX
 (quiet)
 Benjamin?

 SISKO
 For all the good it will 
 do to us.

 DAX
 It would be kind of you to take care of 
 down there, Benjamin.

33 CONTINUED (2)

 SISKO
 Thank you, Doctor.

 DAX
 Would I make a better time?

 WORF
 Captain Sisko has requested my 
 permission to remain.

 Sisko moves her head.

 SISKO
 (continuing, to Odo)
 Im sorry, Worf.

 Worf and OBrien EXIT together.

34 EXTERIOR SPACE - DAX AND WORF (OPTICAL)

 in orbit.

35 INTERIOR DOCKING RING SHIP

 Close on as Worf and OBrien MATERIALIZE. They are 
 greeted with small smiles. Its clear from everyones 
 weary and exhausted.

 DAX
 (good news)
 Benjamin 
 (takes her hand)
 We are ready for the 
 JemHadar.

 WORF
 Excellent. The Admiral has 
 passed!

 Suddenly the ship is shaken violently. Worf taps his 
 finger to a console, and the air in the air is suddenly 
 extremely turbulent.
