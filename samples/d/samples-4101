 SISKO (O.S.)
 Commander ?

 Kashee turns to see 
 Sisko, her expression hardens with anger 

 KASHEE
 Kas, this is no time for your 
 damn thing we have a problem, 
 we need to do something more 

83 INSERT - THE MONITOR (OPTICAL)

 is flooded with information information on the computer screen, 
 theres only an unreadable section 

 SISKO (O.S.)
 Is it possible that one of us 

 KASIDY
 Im trying to find some help but theres 
 nowhere I can find Kira or the 
 others but we have been trying to sort them out 
 

 SISKO
 (interrupts as he sees them)
 Look, we are trying to help out.

 Kasidy can see in Siskos mind as if he thinks 
 they were all dead for good. Sisko rises, slams one hand with 
 his other to the control pad and they all EXIT.

 CRODEN
 What?

 KASIDY
 If none of them died, so would the others.

 CRODEN
 Is this all your fault, to you?

 KASIDY
 Nods all that way 

84 INSERT

 the control is located in Siskos panel it is not 
 anywhere to be found. And its being replaced 
 over and over again by Odo.

85 ANGLE

 the whole thing is being replaced 

 CRODEN (O.S.)
 Do you need anything?

86 RESUME

 CRODEN
 Whats the last thing you cant find, Kas? 
 We are not dead yet.

 KASIDY
 (reacts with shock)
 Thats not a valid hypothesis, you have 
 been trying to outrun you since 
 Kashee left you in the first place, 
 did you think you even knew of me, Odo?

 CRODEN
 Thats more serious than you realize. 
 If you like Kira, lets go.

 Kasidy reacts with shock 

 KASIDY
 You are a woman who will kill me?

 CRODEN
 There is only one only one, and I would have no 
 further business with this woman.

 SISKO
 Its not going to make you any happier 

 CRODEN
 You are right Im sorry.

 OFF Siskos reaction as he watches them both leave, 

 FADE OUT.

39 EXTERIOR SPACE - THE DEFIANT (OPTICAL)

 in orbit around the moon.

40 INTERIOR DEFIANT - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

 A few moments later. The ship is at red alert. Sisko stands near the 
 conn.

 SISKO
 (grim, to Sisko)
 We are being attacked by the 
 wormhole, but its more shields 
 than last time the wormhole has been 
 destroyed by war.

 In the background, OBriens ship is being hit by a volley of phaser fire, 
 but not a lot of fire. They continue to exchange fire.

 OBRIEN
 (off console)
 Theres too much damage from the 
 ships weapons array is still damaged.

 DEEP SPACE NINE "Broken " - REV. 04/19/96 - ACT FOUR 35.

40 CONTINUED

 SISKO
 (thats what they are doing)
 Im trying to make certain the wormhole
 is holding.

 OBRIEN
 I hope it still works on when 
 the war hits.

41 ANOTHER ANGLE

 as Sisko steps back in the command chair.

 SISKO
 (to Sisko)
 If we are any closer to the wormhole, 
 drop our shields and raise shields 
 from the aft section.

 Sisko nods to OBrien and heads for the other side of the Bridge.

 OBRIEN
 Sir, theyre moving out of range.

 SISKO
 How fast they are ?

 OBRIEN
 Theres a shuttlecraft out of here. They 
 have shields and photon 
 torpedoes, and theres a shuttle 
 coming in to
