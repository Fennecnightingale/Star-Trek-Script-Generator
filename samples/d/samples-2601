 GEORDI
 (with regret)
 Howdy. You have got to
 admit, Im a better
 officer than you are.

 BASHIR
 You mean it.

 FEMALE CHAKOTAY
 We will get going. And that

 means there will be no more
innocently controlled
shutdowns.

 OBrien looks up sharply 

 BASHIR
 But you have managed to take down
 your weapon systems. So has
 you. Stand down.

 The Female Chakotay is almost put on by OBrien.
 He holds it out to OBrien. But OBrien refuses.

 BASHIR
 Get him.

 OBrien looks up at the two JemHadar guards, wondering if they
 have gotten out of his grip.

51 NEW ANGLE

 As the JemHadar are beamed up to find -

52 THE RED ALERT (OPTICAL)

 The same red alert we saw earlier, but this time the
 Red Alert is off-line.

54 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

 OBrien hits consoles and the entire cargo
 is JOSOPHET
 CHAKOVAR, armed with a rifle. The
 others are civilians, unarmed.

 JOSEPHET
 (smiles)
 Take this weapon off-line.
 I thought I had its, but its not
 yours.

 GARAK
 I never saw a weapon that
 belonged to you, Mister OBrien.
 You need to be so
 wrong.

 OBRIEN
 Thats right.

 GARAK
 Why not?

 OBRIEN

 Because you are a fool. A
 sentimental fool 

 GARAK
 Dont give me that idea.
 There
 are no
 JemHadar who would
 give a better reason to
 take care of a man like you.
 You are a dog, I know that.
 (a beat)
 Thats not true, I can find
 one.

 OBRIEN
 I know, I know. If you have been
 right, I know I have
 been right. You
 cant argue with that.

 GARAK
 You have to say - you know -

54A INTERIOR MASS OF CHAKOTAY

 Kira has taken out a PADD in front of the desk,
 which is open to a viewport of the stars. It has
 the stars covered by a star-lit, cloudless cloudless starfield,
 which is in the form of a small moon.

 KIRA
 Look at it.

 And as she works, OBrien ENTERS the room, carrying a PADD, 
 carrying a case of containers.

 OBRIEN
 Its like a tiny moon.

 Kira reacts to the PADD.

 KIRA
 How is that possible?

 OBRIEN
 Theres a chance it could
 happen to any one of you
 of us could become an
 accomplice and become a hero. Theres
 one thing I know 

 KIRA
 How?

 OBRIEN
 We can look at each other and
 see if this happens. Theres
 only one thing we cannot
 risk that we both
 lose. No matter how far we
 travel, or
 far we might lose you.

 OBRIEN
 So what are we going to do?

 KIRA
 We are going to find out.

 OBRIEN
 (with regret)
 We have to find out.


 OBRIEN
 If we are losing you - we
 could lose all we have got.

 He pauses for a long beat and then turns back 
 (to Kira, a long silent beat)
 and EXITS.

 OBrien looks around at his people.
 They are a lot poorer than he ever dreamed
 about them. And they are
 people like him - a
 lot poorer than he even knows he does.

 KIRA
 (taken aback)
 It couldnt really be that hard to
 accept. It was made by
 you.


 As it was in all the N.D.s, theres a
 moment in a long dream that OBrien cant quite get back
 to 

 BASHIR (O.S.)
 (O.S.)
 Chief!
