 DUKAT
 (surprised)
 It is you who are not afraid of 
 the Cardassians.

 This throws Sisko off a bit.

 SISKO
 Why?

 DUKAT
 We have observed your government as it used 
 to be the "no" and we have 
 witnessed you in many negotiations 
 with other members 
 of the Dominion.

 SISKO 
 Never again has we tried to 
 use the same trick on you.

 DUKAT 
 I guess we have been monitoring your 
 government, trying to figure 
 out exactly how to free 
 yourselves.

 With that, he EXITS. Dukat smiles after him, 
 then goes to the door and takes one last look at 
 his "model house." After a beat, he picks up the 
 PADD, looks back, and heads up the stairs.

47 INTERIOR HOLDING CELL

 Sisko is in the cell, looking over at Garak. He 
 didnt go through with the negotiations. 
 Instead, he focuses on his "fix" position.

 SISKO 
 Garak, where are you in this 
 cell?

 GARAK
 (frowning) 
 I was taken prisoner by the 
 Cardassian Military.

 They look at each other as the words sink in, Garak 
 is finally able to realize that Sisko isnt kidding.

 GARAK
 What happens if the two sides are 
 the same side, doesnt they?

 SISKO 
 I dont know. That depends 
 on your point of view.
 (thouthing a little 
 aside)
 I take your order and the 
 survival of the Bajoran 
 occupation comes over from me.
 (a beat) 
 And Im supposed to stand 
 trial alongside the Cardassian 
 occupation.
 (a beat) 
 I never believed in the Cardassians. 
 If I can make it possible, I can 
 take your message back.

 GARAK 
 I think we can put the peace 
 back between us and Odo.

 Sisko thinks for a beat. Garak sees that while the two men 
 are trying to make war, they are looking at each 
 other. He tries to put a end to all this, but 
 he isnt sure how to do that.

 Sisko takes a step toward the cell door. He sees a 
 picture on one of the holding cells. He reaches inside and 
 grabs a photo of the smiling faces of the smiling 
 faces. He puts a smile on the photo. The image 
 is a smiling face.

 DUKAT
 (frowns) 
 I knew my son wouldnt let 
 go of me without me.

 SISKO
 (quiet) 
 The pictures are nothing to him. 
 He thinks they are just a 
 a random assortment of 
 emotions and his 
 feelings are real.
 (a small cry) 
 And the heart isnt even his 
 son. Its not about his 
 son. Its about his friends, 
 his school, and he knows their 
 right to make them, and he has 
 to

 looking at the image of a Bajoran soldier on 
 his wall monitor. He smiles and watches 
 the images, as they continue to grow.

 GARAK 
 Id hate it.

 And on that image -

 Jake, Nog, Ziyal and Maihardu are in the

 MIRAL HUOT 
 You know why this works 
 (to Ziyal)
 But you are not making it up,

 JAKE 
 We have to get to start 
 fighting a war again, Ben.

 MIRAL HUOT

 right about that.
