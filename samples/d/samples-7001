 They. Daimon smiles, then turns his
 attention to the PADD.

 DARG
 We will see you at the surface.

 PICARD
 (nods)
 Understood.
 (gruffly)
 Good luck, Doctor.

 Beverly EXITS.

 PICARD
 Mister Data 
 (to Data)
 And you can report the results
 in your report, sir.

 DATA
 Aye, sir. I have my report.


 She EXITS.

 FADE OUT.

 Its a huge crystal-

42 INTERIOR MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

 Worf in the Command Station position. Riker and
 Data at the consoles. Geordi is at the Conn.
 Worf is wearing a Romulan warshirt.

 WORF
 The Helm is secure and our
 weapons are fully
 coordinated.

 Picard ENTERS from his Ready Room. Riker notices something
 on his console.

 RIKER
 Our tactical sensors have
 detected a subspace energy surge
 directly above our Romulan
 ship.

 WORF
 That is incorrect, sir. That
 ship is not within transporter
 range.

 RIKER
 (to Data)
 Commander, based on your
 analysis of the Borg tractor
 beam, can you extrapolate its
 position and magnify?

 DATA
 Yes, sir.

 RIKER
 (to Data)
 Can you give us a fix on the exact
 location and magnification?

 DATA
 Negative. Our sensors are unable
 to-get-to-the-second-impossible
 range.

 RIKER
 Okay, let us have a guess.

 WORF
 It appears our ship is in
 a tractor beam. It is likely that
 we will be standing in
 the middle of that beam.

 OFF Rikers look.

45 INTERIOR ROMULAN READY ROOM

 Picard sitting at his desk. Hes had a vision.
 Beverly ENTERS.

 BEVERLY
 I understand you have been in
 a turbolift on your last
 flight.

 Picard flinches at the noise.

 PICARD
 Not just yet. I was going to take
 this to the transporter room.

 BEVERLY
 Theres nothing wrong with your
 program.

 Picards expression hardens.

 PICARD
 Theres nothing wrong with your
 program. You have an infinite
 number of possible targets.

 STAR TREK "The Enemy" - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT FOUR 38.

45 CONTINUED

 Beverly gives him a look - what is Picard doing
 to his mind?

 PICARD
 I need a few additional days off.

 BEVERLY
 We will see you then.

 As Picard reaches for his computer
 interfaceâ€” suddenly THREE STARFLEET
 ADMIRALS MATERIALIZE in the corridor. Picard flinches.

 RIKER
 (from console)
 Direct access to the Bridge is
 going to be blocked off from the bridge.

 WORF
 Theres an emergency override for
 transport in Ops. We will be unable to
get it through.

 RIKER
 And once the override is in place,
 we will try and take the ship
 into the wormhole.

 WORF
 (works)
 Sir transport may be
 possible. However, the
 authorization code has been scrambled.
 It will take effect in two minutes.

 PICARD
 Very well. I will make my final
 check on all of our possible targets.

 WORF
 Sir transporter cannot handle
 an overload of energy from the
 warp core. It will take a circuit
 wave to reach the three.
 (beat)
 We will need to coordinate the
 distribution of the particles.

 A beat. Picard flinches at the thought of Worf taking the
 responsibility for his organization.

 STAR TREK "The Enemy" - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT FOUR 39.

45 CONTINUED (2)

 WORF
 If transporter is necessary,
 the Captain can still authorize
 it. I will take the orders
 from Mister Crusher.

 A beat as Picard looks at him. Then

 WORF
