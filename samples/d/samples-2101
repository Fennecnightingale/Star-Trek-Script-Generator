 N.

 Theres always nothing more
 worthwhile than getting the 
 hell out of here. I was there to help 
 the ship 

 ODO VOICE
 Dont waste it, Commander. "I 
 cant do that, Chief."

 KIRA
 Dont I? I dont have 
 one to do - I need to know more 
 about the guy.

 ODO
 Id like to.

 KIRA
 Its important that we know who
 you are.

 ODO
 Of course it is. But Im 
 also the Chief Constable.
 (off console)
 We will have more time than 
 the next time you do it.

 KIRA
 We plan to wait.

 ODO
 (definitively)
 Good luck, Colonel.

 KIRA
 "Good luck"

 ODO
 Is he alive, Major? can 
 you see his face? to the 
 right?, thats for sure.

 Odo and Kira exchange a look and Odo nods.

 KIRA
 Good luck, Odo. And Major 
 Kira, you wanted to wish me
 luck, didnt you? I will say, and its 
 good to know you and Major 

 ODO
 (shivers)
 But you know she wasnt your daughter.
 She was my friend. And she 
 always had a little of 
 you on her. She could have 
 whatever kind of a 
 girl she wanted to be. And Major 
 OBrien wouldnt want anything 
 to interfere from what 
 she wanted. If shes not happy, its up to 
 me to explain what happened

 at impulse, the blue planet is in the b.g. at 
 warp.

 as before. Kira is watching Odo as she reacts to 
 what she saw.

 KIRA
 She knew what happened And she still 
 understands that something 
 happened 

 ODO
 It was very cold, just a warm 
 moment between us, but as the 
 two of you, we didnt know there was
 some kind of trauma or illness to 
 play out. I was the first to 
 share the experience, the two of you. 
 Before Captain Sisko took a call during 
 the night?

 KIRA
 I was in the military. But the 
 one who really started me wasnt 
 a soldier. He was a
 scientist. But its not 
 in our culture that this kind of 
 science and human society do not share.

 ODO
 (grimly)
 I didnt find myself describing myself as a 
 scientist I do, Lieutenant. I 
 used the technology to help find out who, 
 who was working for, or who a lot of 
 these people were. But the question is, who 
 those who are?

 KIRA
 I was working with the military all I 
 found was some kind of rogue agent. As a 
 rogue agent. Is it?

 ODO
 Yes. But I did not want to join Starfleet 
 or any of the other 
 institutions 
 that were trying to do this without 
 authorization or some kind of authorization.

40 CONTINUED

 KIRA
 This is an assassination in the 
 public domain?

 ODO
 I have got enough of that kind of 
 questioning to ask 
 your question.
 (soak)
 And I wouldnt you dare do that 
 anyway, Colonel?

 KIRA
 (quiet)
 A lot of questions, Odo. But you asked 
 for Lieutenant Tilly? The truth 
 is the truth, Colonel. You did 
 this on your own for your people, 
 didnt you?

 ODO
 Yes. It seems that I have never asked anyone 

 This awkward moment between them 

 ODO
 Thank you.
 (KIRA
 You are welcome to leave now when 
 you see this man again.)

 ODO
 I will. And Major ?

 ODO
 What a surprise.

 KIRA
 He wants me to go with you 
 to some holosuite when you get. We are still 
 planning to talk.
 (off Odos quick look)
 Is there a problem youd like 
 to talk to me?

 Odo hasnt said. He walks away down the corridor. He is 
 slightly embarrassed to have to ask a simple question.
 He watches Kira over, not happy.
