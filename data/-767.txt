PART ONE 
PICARD Hello, hello. How good to see you all again.
PICARD Yes, yes.
PICARD I know you're all worried, but the Federation and Starfleet are here to help you settle.
PICARD You have my word.
ELNOR He's coming! He's coming!
PICARD Greetings, sisters.
ZANI Let yourself be seen.
ZANI You haven't stopped talking about Admiral Picard since he left.
ZANI Can't you find something to say to him?
ELNOR What did you bring me?
PICARD What did I bring you? Well...
PICARD Now, let me see.
PICARD The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas.
PICARD Enjoy.
ZANI You're making the admiral uncomfortable, Elnor.
ZANI He dislikes displays of emotion.
ZANI And he's not overly fond of children.
PICARD Not at all.
PICARD Someday, I may get used to the Way of Absolute Candor.
ELNOR Wh-Why don't you like children?
ZANI Because they're demanding, distracting and interfere with duty and pleasure alike.
ELNOR My feelings are hurt.
ELNOR I actually did think you were fond of me.
PICARD Correct.
PICARD I like you very much.
ZANI The sisters in Southeast Station tell us things went well there.
PICARD 10,000 new refugees.
PICARD The help of the sisters was invaluable.
PICARD The Federation owes a debt to the Qowat Milat.
ZANI How long can you stay?
ZANI As always, our house and our hearts are open to you.
ELNOR Can I read the book?
PICARD Yes. Of course.
PICARD But in three days, I have to be in Central Station to meet the next convoy.
ELNOR Because last time, you promised that...
ZANI A promise is a prison, Elnor.
ZANI Do not make yourself another's jailer.
PICARD And that reminds me, Zani.
PICARD Last time, I made you a promise that I would try and find some sweet hanifak.
PICARD But I totally forgot that promises were prisons, so...
ZANI Ah-ah-ah.
PICARD It can't be easy being the only boy in a house of women.
PICARD He must get lonely sometimes.
ZANI Yes.
ZANI He is loved, but he does not belong with us.
PICARD I understand.
PICARD It's so good of you to have taken him in the way that you have.
PICARD I will find him a more suitable place soon.
ELNOR En garde!
PICARD "D'Artagnan, who though wanting in practice had a profound theory, redoubled his agility."
PICARD "Jussac, anxious to put an end to this, springing forward, aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary, but the latter parried it."
PICARD "And while..."
ELNOR What does "parried" mean?
PICARD I'll show you tomorrow.
PICARD "And while Jussac was recovering himself, d'Artagnan glided like a serpent beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his body."
PICARD "Jussac fell in a heap."
PICARD "D'Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle."
PICARD I'm busy, Raffi.
PICARD What do you mean "synths have attacked Mars"?
ZANI What will this mean for our mission?
ZANI Will it continue?
PICARD Of course. It must.
PICARD Uh, tell Elnor I'm sorry we didn't finish our fencing lesson.
PICARD But, uh...
PICARD ...well, I'll be back soon.
PICARD Picard ready for transport.
PART TWO
JURATI Hi.
JURATI Oh. You're reading.
JURATI I won't, uh...
RIOS Be my guest.
JURATI So... space turns out to be super boring.
JURATI Go figure.
RIOS What were you expecting?
JURATI I don't know.
JURATI It's so... empty.
JURATI I mean, of course, right?
JURATI It's right there in the name. "Space."
JURATI It's not like it's called "vast quantities of stuff."
JURATI Although, come to think of it, there are over three billion stars in our galaxy alone and ours is one of two trillion.
JURATI There are a septillion known planets, so maybe it should be called "vast quantities of stuff."
JURATI Like, why focus on the negative?
JURATI I caught up on two years of back issues of the Journal of Theoretical Cybernetics, including the Festschrift for Professor Kwok.
JURATI I watered your plants.
JURATI You're welcome.
JURATI I was gonna watch a holo, but weirdly, all you have on board is Klingon opera.
RIOS Long story.
JURATI I used to live with a guy who liked paper books.
JURATI I bothered him, too.
RIOS What did he used to do about it?
JURATI He was my dad.
JURATI He had to put up with it.
JURATI What's your book about?
RIOS The existential pain of living with the consciousness of death, and how it defines us as human beings.
JURATI Well, that's not a conversation killer at all.
JURATI I totally want to talk about the existential pain of living with the consciousness of death.
RAFFI Rios!
JURATI Oh, thank God.
RAFFI I just checked the nav log.
RAFFI Where the hell are we going?
RIOS Says he needs to make a stop.
RAFFI He needs to?
JURATI Picard?
RAFFI What stop?
RIOS Vashti, in the Qiris sector.
RAFFI Vashti.
RAFFI Man can't even take a guilt trip without using a starship.
PICARD Hold.
COMPUTER Holomatrix paused.
MR. HOSPITALITY Is it inaccurate?
PICARD Everything seems absolutely correct, in every particular.
MR. HOSPITALITY We rebuilt your study to the exact specifications.
PICARD I see that.
MR. HOSPITALITY Your Mr. Zhaban supplied me with the holoscans.
MR. HOSPITALITY He thought you might feel more at home.
PICARD It seems a little odd that a working ship should have a hospitality hologram.
MR. HOSPITALITY I came with the basic installation, sir, but you're right, hospitality emergencies are rare on this vessel.
PICARD Mm-hmm.
MR. HOSPITALITY In general, the captain... keeps his own company.
PICARD Come.
RAFFI You want to go to Vashti?
RAFFI Are you out of your goddamn mind?
RIOS I hate that fucking hospitality hologram.
RAFFI That you even suggest it makes me seriously question your mental state.
RAFFI The idea of going there isn't just a bad idea, it's-it's bizarre.
PICARD Look, Dahj's sister is in grave danger.
PICARD She may already be dead.
PICARD I am as eager to get to Freecloud as you.
RAFFI I... Did I ever say I was eager to get to Freecloud?
RAFFI Do-do I seem eager to you?
RIOS I would say more... apprehensive.
RAFFI Look, I-I'm gonna be straight with you.
PICARD Oh, well, that will make a refreshing change.
PICARD Come.
JURATI Oh, uh, is this a secret meeting, or am I technically part of the crew now?
PICARD Please, Dr. Jurati, join us.
PICARD Raffi here was questioning my sanity.
RAFFI You know what? Fine. Let's go to Vashti.
RAFFI Check out that big statue of you.
RAFFI I mean, they-they must've put up at least one.
RIOS If they did, somebody's probably stolen it by now.
RIOS Qiris sector's sketchy nowadays.
RIOS Serious power vacuum.
RIOS Smugglers and petty warlords, like Kar Kantar, basically run the show.
RIOS Kantar got hold of an antique Bird-of-Prey somewhere and has been running wild from Vashti to Daimanta.
RAFFI You didn't already tell him this?
RAFFI He said, "Lay in a course for Vashti, Rios," and, what, you just obeyed, like a good Starfleet officer?
RIOS I assumed he knew.
PICARD But the Qiris sector is in the Fenris Rangers' territory.
RIOS Was. The Rangers just do not have the resources to keep up with the chaos out there anymore.
RAFFI Also, Vashti is a hotbed for the Romulan Rebirth movement.
RAFFI But you're just gonna drop in and pick yourself up a nun.
JURATI O-Okay, well, now somebody has to tell me what we're talking about.
RAFFI JL wants to hire an assassin.
PICARD They are not assassins, and you can't hire them.
PICARD The Qowat Milat have to choose you.
RIOS Romulan warrior nuns.
JURATI That's a real thing?
JURATI How bizarre.
PICARD I know... knew some Qowat Milat.
PICARD On Vashti alone, they helped Raffi and me relocate more than a quarter of a million refugees.
PICARD And they're the most skilled single-combat fighters that I have ever seen and the most feared enemies of the Tal Shiar.
RIOS Sounds like you already owe them more than they owe you.
RIOS What-what makes you think they're gonna help you now?
PICARD They have their own criterion whether to give or withhold their assistance to a cause.
JURATI And what is that?
PICARD Let's just say that I am confident that they will find ours worthy, and if they don't, the Way of Absolute Candor means that they won't hesitate to tell us.
JURATI What's the Way of Absolute Candor?
PICARD It's their primary teaching: total communication of emotion without any filter between thought and word.
PICARD And it runs entirely counter to everything that the Romulans hold dear.
PICARD Resume.
RAFFI JL.
RAFFI Losing Dahj has you thinking about Vashti and the kid.
PICARD Elnor.
RAFFI Okay.
RAFFI But you remember what we used to say back then?
PICARD "One impossible thing at a time."
RAFFI We have to stick to the plan.
RAFFI Freecloud.
PICARD I may never pass this way again.
PICARD I'll be in my quarters.
JURATI Anyone else think the Way of Absolute Candor sounds potentially annoying?
PART TWO 
ROMULAN VOICE Professor Ramdha, what can you tell us about Ganmadan?
RAMDHA'S VOICE Ganmadan is what our ancestors called the Day of Annihilation.
ROMULAN VOICE When you say "annihilation"...
RAMDHA'S VOICE All life, everywhere.
RAMDHA'S VOICE When all the shackled demons break their chains, and answer the call of The Destroyer.
RIOS Used to be home?
PICARD Of a sort.
PICARD For a moment.
PICARD Security?
RAFFI Standard Romulan planetary defense system, bought secondhand.
RAFFI The Fenris Rangers helped them install it.
RAFFI It's primitive but effective.
RAFFI Your basic impenetrable shield of orbital killer drones.
RAFFI Every 30 minutes, a transit zone opens up in a random spot in the network.
RAFFI If the system clears you, you have a minute to pass through.
RAFFI Try to come or go without clearance, and you're met with immediate kill-fire.
PICARD Do we have clearance?
RAFFI I'm working several angles, but so far, no.
PICARD Call Central Station.
PICARD Tell them it's me.
RAFFI That was the first thing we did.
RAFFI Frankly, they were not impressed.
PICARD Very well.
PICARD Suggestions?
RIOS A cash gift is always appropriate.
PICARD Jolan tru, Qowat Milat.
ZANI Jolan tru.
OTHERS: Jolan tru.
ZANI You got old, Admiral Picard.
PICARD You didn't.
ZANI I remind you, this is a house of truth.
ZANI I thought we would never see you again.
PICARD I don't have the right, but I need your help one last time.
ELNOR Sorry.
NAREK Poor Ramdha.
NAREK She's always been a bit of a tormented soul.
SOJI You know her?
NAREK I'm not surprised she tried to take her own life.
SOJI I don't know why I feel so drawn to her, but it's my fault.
SOJI Something about me set her off.
NAREK Don't blame yourself.
NAREK She is disordered.
SOJI When she looked at me, I felt... seen.
SOJI Even though she didn't like what she saw.
NAREK I see you, Soji.
SOJI I'm a trusting person, Narek. That's my default, but...
SOJI I don't know.
SOJI You kind of challenge my paradigm.
NAREK Give me another chance?
SOJI How did you know I was going to the Disordered Ward just now?
NAREK I didn't.
SOJI Have you been watching me?
NAREK Not in the way that you mean it.
SOJI No uniform, no insignia, no rank.
SOJI You go anywhere you like on the Artifact, and you know things.
SOJI Are you Tal Shiar?
NAREK No.
SOJI If you were Tal Shiar, would you also answer no?
NAREK Yes.
SOJI Do you know what happened to Ramdha's ship, to the Shaenor?
NAREK No.
SOJI Who does?
NAREK I don't know.
NAREK I would imagine there are some kind of records on the Borg databases here.
SOJI Those are classified.
SOJI Do you have access to them?
NAREK No.
NAREK But I might know someone who does.
NAREK How's the paradigm?
SOJI Paradigmatic.
NAREK Come on.
NAREK I want to show you something.
SOJI Where are we going?
NAREK I'm going to teach you an ancient Borg ritual.
SOJI The Borg didn't have rituals.
NAREK That's what everyone thinks.
NAREK This program you watched, the one with Ramdha... it was in Romulan?
SOJI A talk show called Yrrh Mnrrh.
NAREK Who taught you such good Romulan?
SOJI An old friend of my father's. A professor at the U.
NAREK Seattle, sometime before May 12, 2396, when you shipped out for the Beta Quadrant aboard the Ellison.
SOJI So you have been watching me.
NAREK Here we are.
NAREK The ventilation return.
NAREK Take off your shoes.
SOJI What? Why?
NAREK Borg ritual.
NAREK Shoes off.
NAREK Now, watch this.
NAREK Yeah!
NAREK Terran passenger lists are a matter of public record, which is shocking to a Romulan sensibility.
NAREK But strangely, there's no record that you were a passenger on the Ellison that day.
SOJI Well, I was.
SOJI Are you calling me a liar?
SOJI To hell with you.
NAREK What about the Borg data files?
NAREK The ones that might explain what happened on the Shaenor.
NAREK To hell with them, too?
SOJI What are you doing, Narek?
NAREK The same thing you're doing.
NAREK Feeding an insatiable curiosity.
RAFFI Damn.
RIOS What?
RAFFI Somebody I.D.'d him.
RAFFI He's blowing up on personal comm traffic down there.
JURATI Good blowing up or bad blowing up?
RAFFI Mm...
RAFFI Bad. Catastrophically bad.
RIOS We should get him out of there.
PICARD No, not now, Raffi.
PICARD I need more time.
RAFFI These aren't love letters, JL.
RAFFI There's a lot of anger.
PICARD I am quite safe here.
RIOS I'm picking up an incoming ship, just at the limit of the scanner range.
PART FOUR 
RIOS Moving kind of slow. Looks like... that old Bird-of-Prey.
RAFFI I'm glad you're safe.
RAFFI We're about to get a visit from Kar Kantar.
PICARD Well, you do what you have to do, and I need more time.
PICARD Picard out.
ZANI We do what we can to maintain peace.
ZANI Half the sisters serve as qalankhan, freeblades patrolling roads and waterways, helping travelers, defending Romulan and Terran alike.
PICARD Do the Qowat Milat still bind their blades to a singular cause?
ZANI If the cause is judged worthy.
PICARD Uh, no, thank you, Elnor.
PICARD Elnor?
ZANI You feel shame seeing Elnor.
PICARD I always imagined that you had found a suitable place for him.
ZANI So many things we imagined back then never came to be.
PICARD But it's not just Elnor.
PICARD It's everything here... the poverty, the degradation, the ethnic strife.
PICARD When I left here, there was none of this.
ZANI Because you could not save everyone, you chose to save no one.
PICARD Yes.
PICARD I allowed the perfect to become the enemy of the good.
ZANI You have not spoken of your purpose yet.
ZANI I infer that you have come to obtain the services of a qalankhkai. Why?
PICARD I am taking on the Tal Shiar, alone.
ZANI So your cause is a desperate one.
PICARD It is to me.
ZANI Another rescue?
PICARD If I'm not too late.
ZANI You're not too late to rescue Elnor.
ZANI He does not belong here.
ZANI Once the evacuation ended, we simply never found a better home for him.
PICARD He completed his training?
ZANI Last spring.
PICARD So he really is a Qowat Milat?
ZANI No. And as a man, he never can be.
ZANI But he is open-hearted, and apart from this display of the reticence you always seemed to inspire in him, forthright.
ZANI And his fighting skills are truly formidable.
PICARD And you would send him away?
PICARD He might find himself in serious danger.
PICARD He might die.
ZANI He will.
ZANI Before that comes to pass, it would gladden my heart to see him live.
PICARD When you bind your sword to a cause, is there some kind of protocol?
PICARD A ritual?
PICARD Do-do I go on my knees?
PICARD Oh, I do hope not.
PICARD Between the two of us, my knees are not what they used to be.
ELNOR You tell a story, I listen.
ELNOR Simple.
PICARD I had a friend called Data.
ELNOR It's usually a sad story.
PICARD He died.
PICARD He gave his life to save mine, and I have missed him ever since.
ELNOR Did you ever miss me?
PICARD Of course I did.
ELNOR Continue.
PICARD Well, recently, I've learned that Data... this is complicated... that Data had two offspring.
PICARD And one of them... her name was "Dahj"... was murdered in front of me.
PICARD The other one, I believe, is in serious danger.
PICARD And I have to find her before the Tal Shiar do.
ELNOR The Tal Shiar?
PICARD Yes.
ELNOR And this other sister... is she an android?
PICARD Mm-hmm.
ELNOR You told me stories about Data.
ELNOR He had an orange cat named Spot.
PICARD That's right.
ELNOR I've still never seen a cat.
PICARD Well, if you come with us, you might just run across one or two of them.
ELNOR Why do you need me?
PICARD Because I failed to protect her sister.
ELNOR But you don't know where she is or if she's even alive.
PICARD No.
ELNOR What about the man who built her?
PICARD It's just a guess.
ELNOR Are you being pursued?
PICARD Likely.
PICARD Anticipated, actually.
ELNOR All that is why you need someone.
ELNOR Why do you need me?
PICARD Because I'm an old man and you're a young one, and you're strong.
PICARD Zani told me that you are one of the best fighters that she has ever seen.
PICARD It seems to me that my quest has the appropriate criterion.
PICARD Will you come with me?
PICARD Will you bind your sword to my quest?
ELNOR Now that you have use for me?
ELNOR Now that I have value to you?
ELNOR You left me on my own, old man.
PICARD I never meant to...
ELNOR I see no reason not to do the same.
PICARD Elnor, it...!
PICARD Rios, it's Picard.
PICARD I'm ready for transport.
RIOS Copy that.
RIOS Next window opens in seven minutes.
ANDREV You may call me gTenqem Adrev.
ANDREV We met before.
ANDREV Once.
PICARD Have we? Forgive me. I, uh...
ANDREV Oh, it was in another lifetime, when I was another man.
ANDREV A Romulan senator, if you can believe it.
ANDREV I had the honor of being present the day you addressed the Hall of State, the very embodiment of Starfleet, making such eloquent and generous promises on behalf of the magnanimous Federation.
ANDREV The great Saint Picard.
PICARD Senator...
ANDREV I found it extremely moving.
ANDREV How very touched we all were.
ANDREV There were tears in my eyes.
PICARD Thank you.
ANDREV And then you went away.
ANDREV And when you returned, you brought the ships.
ANDREV Those great big Wallenberg-class transports.
ANDREV We all packed and boarded the Nightingale, five generations of parents and grandparents, siblings and spouses and children.
ANDREV And the Nightingale brought us here, to Vashti.
PICARD We had so little time.
PICARD There were so many of you to save.
ANDREV And so little to be expected from Starfleet.
PICARD I did everything I could.
ANDREV And then you gave up.
ANDREV Skantal!
ANDREV Bidran!
PICARD My friends. I grieve.
ANDREV No one asked for your pity, Picard.
ANDREV Just as no one asked for your help.
ANDREV You and Starfleet had no understanding of Romulan ingenuity, resolve, self-sufficiency.
ANDREV You took advantage of us at the very moment where we doubted ourselves, enticed us with your empty promises, and did everything in your power to scatter, confuse and divide us.
PICARD That is not so!
PICARD I promise you...
ANDREV You promise?!
ANDREV You promise?
ANDREV Give him your sword.
PICARD No.
ANDREV Come on.
PICARD No!
ELNOR Please, my friend.
ELNOR Choose to live.
ELNOR I regret your choice.
ELNOR I have bound myself to Picard as qalankhkai.
ELNOR Anyone who threatens him will be choosing to die.
PICARD Enough, Elnor.
PICARD The Federation has failed you all.
PICARD I failed you all.
PICARD I... broke faith with you, and the result was terrible... pain and loss for you all.
PICARD And I am sorry.
PICARD Picard, ready for transport.
SKANTAL A tan qalanq is no match for a disruptor, sisterboy.
RAFFI JL?
PICARD Yes! Now!
PICARD That man did not deserve to die.
ELNOR Yet he chose it. Fight a Qowat Milat, and the outcome is not in doubt.
PICARD Now, you listen to me, carefully.
PICARD I will benefit by your skill and your courage, but if you bind yourself to my cause, I will tell you when to fight and when to refrain.
PICARD Is that understood?
ELNOR Yes.
PICARD Swear it.
ELNOR I swear.
PICARD Dr. Jurati, Raffi, this is Elnor.
RAFFI A boy with a stick.
PICARD I have to ask you, what made you decide to bind yourself to my cause?
ELNOR It met the requirements for worthiness.
ELNOR And it seemed like you needed me after all.
JURATI What is the requirement for worthiness?
PICARD A qalankhkai would only bind herself... himself... to a lost cause.
NAREK Light!
NARISSA What?
NARISSA Did you think it was your robot friend?
NARISSA I take it she's anatomically correct.
NARISSA It makes perfect sense.
NARISSA You've been studying her kind your whole adult life.
NARISSA Waiting for her.
NARISSA Planning for her.
NARISSA Wondering what it would be like when you finally saw her.
NARISSA Now here she is.
NAREK Why is she obsessed with Ramdha?
NAREK What happened when the cube assimilated the Shaenor?
NAREK Why did its crew and passengers lose their minds?
NAREK Who were they?
NARISSA What have you accomplished on my behalf?
NAREK I've planted the first seed of doubt.
NARISSA Really?
NARISSA One whole seed.
NARISSA Impressive.
NAREK I know how to handle her.
NAREK If I press her too hard, it might activate her.
NAREK And then we'll have another situation like on Earth, and then they'll both be dead.
NARISSA That is the goal, you know.
NARISSA To kill them.
NAREK Yes, all of them.
NAREK Which is something I can't do until we find out where she came from and where the rest of them are.
NARISSA And in the meantime... you slide ever deeper into your own obsession.
NARISSA Have you entertained for even a moment that she might be the one handling you?
NARISSA She was sent to this cube for a reason.
NARISSA Your little robot girl has a plan.
NARISSA Don't forget that.
NAREK I know full well...
NARISSA Who is she, Narek?
NARISSA Who... is she?
NAREK Seb-Cheneb.
NAREK The Destroyer.
NARISSA I'll give you and your seed one more week.
NARISSA After that, if I don't have the location, we go back to good old... pain and violence.
RIOS It's Kantar!
RIOS Near miss. Hold on.
COMPUTER Engaging auto-evasion protocol.
RIOS That old heap's targeting system is primitive, but the planetary security net worries me.
RAFFI Just get us the hell out of here.
COMPUTER Shield strength at eighty-nine percent.
JURATI Can you go faster than that Bird-of-Prey?
RIOS Maybe not outrun him, but I can definitely outfly him.
RIOS We-we should be...
RIOS Emmet, I could use a little help!
EMMET You fly, I shoot
COMPUTER Weapons online.
EMMET They're pushing us into the security net.
RIOS You gotta be kidding me.
EMMET You'll come within range of the drones in nine point four seconds.
RIOS What happened to shooting them?
RIOS Hold on.
COMPUTER Routing additional power to thrusters.
COMPUTER Routing additional power to inertial dampener.
EMMET Too close to the net.
RIOS Where did that come from?
RAFFI Trying to get a read.
RAFFI No ID, no transponder.
RAFFI Great timing, though.
EMMET Hideous ship.
RIOS Magnificient pilot.
RIOS Bastard.
RAFFI That pilot's hailing us, JL.
PICARD Open a channel.
PICARD Uh...
RIOS Open the channel.
RIOS Put him on.
RAFFI He's asking permission to beam over.
RAFFI His ship's breaking up.
EMMET Nah, too risky.
RAFFI His shields are failing.
PICARD Raffi, beam him in, directly here.
RIOS Do it.
PICARD Elnor.
RAFFI Got him.
PICARD Seven of Nine?
SEVEN You owe me a ship, Picard.
THE END
