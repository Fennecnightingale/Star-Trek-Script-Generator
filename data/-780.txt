PART ONE

BOIM Oh, God, Oh, God.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

This is bad. This is very bad.
I'm not supposed to be here.

I have a pottery class at 0900!

MAR Hey, just calm down.
We don't know what this is.

BOIM Are you kidding me?! Creepy
stone walls, jagged metal bars.

This has alien prison
written all over it.

RUTH A prison? Nah. No way, man.

- This is a dungeon.
BOIM - That's even worse!

Hello? Can someone give us
some context in here, please?

TEN A dungeon?! But we
didn't do anything. Did we?

Oh.


 


I've been replicating
a lot of ice.

Are we not supposed to do that?

I really like ice.

BOIM I saw the captain
and the bridge crew

get taken into another room.

TEN What if they
were replicating ice, too?!

MAR Guys, this is basically a resort

compared to what
the Klingons do to you.

I'm sure it's not a big...

TEN - Uh, hi?
RUTH - Oh, man,

they have all of our commanders
suspended in a beam!

MAR - They must be on trial.
BOIM - For what?

PRIME Fellow Primes!

These Federation witnesses
have been brought before you


 


to speak truth

about the senior officers

of the Federation starship
Cerritos.

BOIM I-I didn't witness anything.
Did you?

MAR I don't know. What's the
difference between witnessing

and just lookin' at something?

PRIME You will speak only
into the Horn of Candor!

With this horn,
one of our most sacred horns,

you must only speak the truth.

RUTH Happy to be here.

BOIM I-I don't even know
what we're supposed

to be telling the truth about.

PRIME The first to give testimony
will be

Ensign Beckett Mariner.

Ship logs state
you were present on the bridge

when the Cerritos made contact
with the Clicket ship Tweerk

on stardate 57818.4.

MAR Uh, I was, but I don't know
what you want me to...

PRIME Tell us
of those wondrous events!

MAR Okay. It started off
as a usual day.

We were just hanging out.
I mean, we were just doing work

in the repair bay.

Roga Danar? Are you nuts?

I said "Who's
the all-time biggest badass?"

not "Who's a dude
nobody's heard about?"

BOIM Uh, everyone knows Roga Danar.

MAR - No, they don't.
BOIM - He totally outsmarted Picard,

and he has amazing hair!

MAR Well, what about Khan, right?

Khan was a genetically
engineered supervillain!

Dude was a space seed.

TEN Ooh, ooh, pause for a second.
I want to talk about Khan

and that thicc, thicc chest,
but I got to pee.

MAR Roga Danar.

Get the out of my face.

TEN Guys, the ship's at red alert.

BOIM Uh, no, it isn't.

Yeah, that's impossible.

RUTH I messed with our speakers
so they'd be extra loud

during a red alert.
We'd know for sure.

MAR You messed
with the red alert speakers?

MAR Uh, it's, like, red alert
everywhere except here!

BOIM - Rutherford!
RUTH - Aw, man.

BOIM Oh, we're gonna get
in such big trouble for this.

MAR We have to get to our stations!

BOIM Gah, why did we have
to have bridge duty today?

We're gonna walk in
and everyone's gonna be

- lookin' at us.
MAR - No, they won't. Just chill.

BOIM Okay, we'll just explain what
happened and why we're late.

It'll-it'll be fine.

MAR You want Rutherford fired? No.

Just follow my lead, all right?
We'll fake it.

BOIM - Fake what?!
MAR - It!

BOIM I'm not faking on the bridge.

That's insane!

MAR The captain already knows
what she wants you to do,

so just nod and agree with her,

or we'll all end up
getting kicked off the ship

and then we'll have
to live on Earth,

where there's nothing to do
except drink wine

and hang out at vineyards
and soul food restaurants!

PART TWO

CAP Ugh, these guys are maniacs.

RAN Captain, what happened?

CAP They just randomly attacked me
for thanking them.

INSECT This injustice will not stand.

We gave you the map,
and now you turn on us?!

CAP Captain, this is all
a misunderstanding.

I simply showed gratitude for
your map of the Neutral Zone.

INSECT Gratitude?! How dare you!

BOIM - Who is this guy?
MAR - Who cares, man?

Bug alien. Roll with it.

CAP I meant no offense.

I think your people have
a different definition

of "gratitude."

INSECT Give us back the map!

CAP Ugh, this guy is really buggin'!

Mariner, what do you think?

MAR I think you know exactly how
to handle this, Captain.

CAP You're right about that.

Ensign Boimler, I want options.

BOIM Uh, about the... this alien guy?

CAP Yes. Obviously.

BOIM Uh, what specifically do
you wish to know?

SHAX Aw, come on, man!

This is your chance to prove
you got what it takes!

BOIM Oh! Well,
I-I don't know, uh, who, uh...

Well, the truth is...

Uh, I think we should do,

uh, what you want to do, Cap'n.

Cap'n's choice.

CAP I'm not asking you
to kiss my ass.

Come on. No wrong answers.

BOIM Uh, okay.
We could do evasive maneuver

eighty...

eight...?

T'ANA Is he ing serious?

BOIM That was the wrong answer!

- I meant 84.
MAR - In this situation?

- Are you crazy?
BOIM - Mariner!

CAP Have you
not been paying attention?

That could get us killed.

BOIM No, no, no, no. I was kidding.

Let's just... Let's use the
impulse drive to... Crazy Ivan.

SHAX - Ugh! Who the hell is he talking about?
- What in the world is that?!

- What? -That's insane.
BOIM - But-but-but-but...

RAN Son,
you're embarrassing yourself.

CAP You got a lot to learn. Mariner,

MAR why don't you send
our friends a message.

Good call, Captain.

CAP - What?! -Are you insane?!
RAN - What the hell are you doing?!

MAR You said "Send them a message."
That means phasers!

CAP It means to send them a message
to invite them to dinner!

MAR No, it doesn't!

INSECT Target their bridge!

PRIME Stop! Stop!

What are you talking about?!

MAR What? I'm just telling you
what happened.

PRIME You expect me to believe
a Starfleet officer

wouldn't know what's going on
with their ship

at all times?!

MAR Look, I'm not proud of it,
but yeah.

PRIME What about the map?

Tell me about the map!

MAR Uh, there was a map?

PRIME That's the most important part!

MAR Dude, look, I work
on a spaceship, all right?

We don't have maps.
We have stellar cartography.

PRIME What is wrong with you?!

Place her
in the Tank of Contempt!

Oh! We got eels.
There's eels over here.

BOIM Mariner's not lying!
I was there!

We didn't see a map!

PRIME Perhaps this is
a misunderstanding.

You may go un-eeled.

For now.

MAR Better luck next time, eels.

BOIM Why does this guy care so much
about a map of the Neutral Zone?

RUTH Yeah, it's so neutral.

TEN Yeah, like, what would you
even do with a map like that?

I have no idea.

PRIME Ensign Samanthan Rutherford,

perhaps you
can illuminate me more

than your unobservant
compatriots.

RUTH Um, well, I mean,
my cyborg implant

does give me perfect memory.

PRIME That will be of great use!

Tell me of stardate 57791.1.

RUTH All right.
Stardate 5779, eh... Hey.

Wait, are you sure
you want that one?

Just 'cause I have
so many great stardates in here.

Other than that one.

PRIME I want the one I said!

RUTH Uh, you're not gonna like it.
So, there I was,

rotating the EPS capacitors.

See, they overheat
when you leave them

facing one direction too long.

Hey, sirs!
You want to rotate with me?

Maybe sing a little song?

If you heard the one earlier...

SHRAX No! Does your implant
have Romulan flight manuals

- and repair information?
RUTH- Uh, not right now.

- I'd need to update it.
SHAX - Then do it. Now!

RUTH Uh, well, usually I like
to update it while I'm asleep

'cause it kind of messes
with my...
SHAX - No! Do it now!
BILL- You do it right this second!

RUTH Okeydokey.

30 seconds until restart.

SHAX - Is it done yet?!
RUTH - What? No. It just started.

BILL While we wait, I'll fill you in
on the plan.

BILL Oh, uh, first off:
do you have all your shots?

RUTH - Wait. Which shots? Like, with needles?
IMPLANT - Ten seconds.

RUTH Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. Let me just...

SHAX We don't want you getting
Dinobulan flesh-eating bacteria

- on your pe...
RUTH - Hold up just a second. My implant is also...

SHAX - It'll eat right through your underpants.
RUTH- My what?!

SHAX I've seen it happen.
Terrible way to die.

IMPLANT - Restarting Rutherford.
RUTH - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

Wait, wait, wait.

PART THREE

RUTH Whoa. I think I blacked out

and lost a little bit of time
during that update.

SHAX Great work nerve-pinching
those Vulcans, baby bear.

Who knew you'd be better
at it than they are?

RUTH - I did? But I don't know how to nerve-pinch.
SHAX - Ha!

Tell that to Spock and Spock.

RUTH Oh, when my implant
was rebooting,

it must have taken control.

BILL We're entering the atmosphere.
Brace for turbulence.

RUTH Sirs, you don't understand.
I don't know what's going on.

SHAX When we're in the museum, our
window's gonna be really tight.

RUTH - Museum?
SHAX - We have to deploy now!

RUTH No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

IMPLANT Verifying update. System will
restart in three seconds.

RUTH - Ah! Romulan Bird-of-Prey?
SHAX - Quiet!

We don't want
to draw any attention.

RUTH - From who? What are we doing? What's happening?
SEC - Hey!

What are you two doing
back here?

You've drawn my attention.

SHAX Distract him with the fan dance!

RUTH I'm sorry. My what now?

SHAX - Dance, boy! Dance!
RUTH - Ooh. Ooh. Yeah.

Feels good, feels right...

SEC Hey! Stop that!
Now you're distracting me!

RUTH Right. Right.

SEC I want the regular fan dance!

What are you doing?!

RUTH My best.

IMPLANT Verifying download.

RUTH Aah! What the heck?!

Hello? How am I standing
in space?

Huh?

Ah.

Cloaked Bird-of-Prey.
Wait. Did I steal this?!

BILL - Aah, Mark Twain's got a gun!
RUTH - Billups! Oh, man, are you okay?

BILL - Tasha, no! The garbage bag's behind you!
RUTH - Oh, no.

Sir,
you have nitrogen intoxication.

You only have 60 seconds
of air left!

SHAX Stop goofing around!
Get in here!

RUTH Verifying update.
System restart in ten second.

SHAX Watch it!
No, no, no, over there!

RUTH Stupid... cloaked Bird.

IMPLANT - Updating Klingon fonts.
RUTH - What?!

Why do I even need that?

SHAX Watch out for the controls!

They're set to...

RUTH Gorn wedding!

Aah! Get me out of here,
implant!

Nice try, Gorns!

It's still the Gorn wedding?

Ouch. Help! Help!
Come on, Gorns, please!

PRIME A Gorn wedding?!

How has this become
about a Gorn wedding?!

What are you avoiding?

RUTH Look, I'm just telling you
the events

of stardate 57791.1, all right?

Damn. Rude.

PRIME I want details on how
you stole the Bird-of-Prey!

RUTH I know, man. Me, too!

BOIM Wait. Why would Shaxs
make him steal

some old Bird-of-Prey? What
would they even do with that?

TEN Beats me. I mean,
it could be for anything.

Like, who even knows?

PRIME Take him!

RUTH Eels?!

MAR Dude, are you not
paying attention?

TEN - Hey! Leave them alone!
PRIME - Oh?

Well, perhaps you,
Ensign D'vana Tendi,

can prove more illuminating.

TEN Oh, I've always wanted
to testify about stuff!

This is so cool!

Hi, everyone!

PRIME Don't talk to them!

Have you
and Commander Jack Ransom

ever set foot
in the Romulan Neutral Zone?

TEN I can't tell you that.

PRIME Oh, come on!
This is an easy one!

Why are you making this
so difficult?

BOIM ...Tendi,
just tell him what he wants!

TEN All right, fine! But this was
a classified mission,

so I'll have
to leave some things out.

I had just been given
a major assignment.

Mariner! Mariner, guess what?

I get to tidy
the conference rooms!

Ah! What should I wear?

Probably just my uniform, right?

MAR Ugh! How are you so excited?

You know you're just gonna be
wiping cat fur off chairs.

TEN Uh, do you know how many
big decisions happen

in those conference rooms?

That's where
they talk about the Borg.

MAR You can talk about the Borg
anywhere.

TEN Yeah, but when you do it
in a conference room,

it becomes a conference.

MAR I never get
to clean the conference room.

TEN Wow.

The captain's chair.

Oh, I'm gonna make you
extra clean. Huh?

RAN Secure the room, Lieutenant.

LT - Yes, sir.
PRIME - Okay, stop.

You can't omit details
like that!

TEN Yeah, but I already did, so...

PRIME Are you so stubborn

that you're willing
to risk death by eels?

TEN Yes, that's correct.

PRIME Then continue.

TEN You must be The Cleaner.

Yes, sirree.
And happy to be here.

RAN Glad to have you. This
mission is highly classified.

From here on out, you're

- and.
TEN - Wow.

RAN All right, everybody,
listen up. I'm serious.

This is important.
If we're captured...

TEN He's glad to have me!

Gosh, it's just so nice
to be recognized for my work.

And cleaning the conference room
is important. I knew it.

Wait, I should be
paying attention.

RAN This is why we got
matching tattoos.

LT - 10-4.
BLONDE LT - Lock and load.

BALD LT We're for life.

RAN Check out this map.
It's gonna lead us

- straight into the Neutral Z...
- ...one.

TEN The Neutral what, now?

RAN The package is located here.

Guards are stationed
here and here on weekends.

If we run into trouble,
Cleaner will extract us.

Let's fuck this shit up!

TEN Yeah...

Phaser rifles.

RUTH Oh, snap!
That's the ship from my stor!

TEN I knew
I should have made it clear

that I wasn't supposed
to be there,

but every time I was about to...

So, here is a very funny thing.

Um, I think that there was
a misunderstanding,

- and I...
ANDORIAN LT - Everyone quiet! They're scanning the area.

RAN - Ah...
- That was close.

We're lucky we have this
Bird-of-Prey, or we'd be toast.

TEN Uh, but what I was saying was...

ANDORIAN LT Shh! They're scanning again.

They stopped scanning.
RAN Cleaner, what was that?

TEN - What I was saying was...
ANDORIAN LT  - Oh, no, they're scanning!

Okay, now they're not
scanning anymore.

RAN - Anything important... Whoa!
TEN - What I was...

ANDORIAN LT  Stop! I'm picking up scannin!

Okay, they're done scanning.
Oh, God!

They're scanning again!

No, no. That was on me.

That was wrong. No, I wasn't!

TEN Uh, so, a-about me
being "the cleaner..."

RAN Yeah, yeah. At your age,
it's very impressive.

Comm silence from here on out.

TEN Whoa.

ROMULAN - You know who I hate? Remans.
OTHER ROMULAN - Oh, they're the worst.

TEN Sorry.

RAN Apologizing to the enemy?

- That's cold, Cleaner.
- You're playing

some real up mind games.

- Stay here, cover our six.
TEN - Six what?

RAN Copy.

Is that the package?

Cleaner, do your thing!

TEN What's my thing? I have a thing?
What's my thing?!

ANDORIAN LT Whoa, I thought she was
just supposed to beam us

- out of here.
RAN - She was.

I do not know what's going
on here. This is crazy.

Congrats, boys.

The package is safely on board,

and there's no indication
that the Rom...

...ulan high council
detected us.

Yeah!

Too bad we have to deny
this ever happened,

because you were awesome.

You,

you're crazy.

TEN This is where Billups sits.

PART FOUR

PRIME Stop!

You expect me to believe that?

Yes, that is where Billups sits.

You did not do martial arts

on multiple armed guards!

TEN You're right. I didn't.

PRIME I tried to be reasonable.

I tried to get to the truth.

Today didn't have to end
in eels!

Ignite the burners!

Oh!

MAR Why would you have burners
and eels? It's redundant!

PRIME Just tell me about the package.
What was inside the package?

TEN I don't know, but whatever
it was, I'm sure it was great.

I think you're hurting the eels!

PRIME This can all be
over if you just tell me

what your bridge crew did!

BOIM We can't tell you.

PRIME Why? Why?

BOIM Because we don't know!

We never know anything!

We're lower decks.

No one ever tells us
what's going on.

We're not important enough

to have anything
to lie to you about.

PRIME You're Starfleet.
Surely you must be briefed

on every contingency.

BOIM Yeah, I wish.
The senior officers

don't always have time
to keep us up to speed.

Hell, sometimes, they don't
even know what's going on.

PRIME Impossible!

Human lies!

You are the best of the best!

Your senior officers

are always in full control!

BOIM No, they're not.
They mess up all the time.

Like whenever Q shows up.

"Q" Voilà!

CAP - Oh, what?
- Damn you, Q!

"Q"  Good luck solving
my little puzzle, mes amis.

Tell me, now, can you prove
that humanity is worth saving?

I think not.

CAP Well, he clearly wants us

to play something.

Ah! It's soccer. Okay.

- Oh!
SOCCER BALL - What's humanity all about?

It's puzzle time.
It's puzzle time.

CAP - Ugh. Any ideas? Anybody?
BOIM - Oh!

Or half of Ransom's alien dates

that he doesn't do
any research for.

RAN You are so funny, Mary Anne.

How about we keep this party
going in my quarters?

MAR Hey. Hey, Jack. FYI, you're
hitting on a salt vampire.

RAN Yeah, right. Nice try.

 Salt vampires died out
more than a century ago.

MAR - All right. Cool, be safe.
RAN- Come on, Mary Anne.

Let's get out of here.

I'll give you the tour
of casa de Ransom.

Salt vampire!

PRIME - You're making this up.
BOIM - Nuh-uh.

I read all their logs. They'e
stepping in it all the time.

T'ANA Captain. Captain!

Someone is replacing
everyone on the ship

with imposters
who claim not to know me.

We might be
in a parallel dimension.

ALTERNATE CAP- And you are?
T'ANA - Uh...

Wait, is this...
is this not the Cerritos?

ALTERNATE CAP This is the Alhambra.
Did you get on the wrong ship?

T'ANA They all look the same!

ALTERNATE T'ANA Who the hell was that?

PRIME Why are you doing this to me?

I need you to tell me

that your senior officers
are infallible heroes.

BOIM Well, they're not.
And that's okay.

We all joined Starfleet

to dive headfirst
into the unknown.

We're explorers.

Of course we don't always know
what's going on.

Did Picard know about the Borg?

Did Kirk know about
that giant Spock on Phylos?

Did Dr. Crusher know about
that ghost in the lamp thing

from the Scottish planet
that she hooked up with

that one time? That whole thing.

You clearly want us to say
that the captain

and her crew messed up,

but we simply don't have
the full story,

and that's the truth!

Whatever they did, I guarantee
you it was all for good.

You have shown no evidence
that they're guilty of a crime.

In fact, I find you guilty

of trying to take them down
with this sham of a trial!

Drumhead!


CLAR  Wait, you think this is a trial?

Uh, yes?

TEN - It's not?
MAR - Yeah, I mean, it's pretty trial-y.


CLAR  Could someone
bring up the lights?

This isn't a trial.

It's a party,
for this brave crew

who rescued me
from the Romulans.

What?

I was kidnapped by Romulans

and held for over a year
until they saved me.

CAP Imperium Magistrate Clar, you're
safe now, aboard the Cerritos.


CLAR  Thank you, Captain Freeman.
Thank you.

You must come and celebrate
with me on K'Tuevon Prime.

Your deeds and my victory
will forever be etched

- onto our great history stone.
CAP - Can't say no to a party.

T'ANA Oh, great, guess I'll have
to shave my [REDACTED].

Yeah, maybe you should.

BOIM What's that about?

MAR I don't know, man.
Something dumb.


CLAR  This was supposed
to be my special day.

MAR No. No, no, no, no, no.
This is a trial.

You said we were witnesses,

- you said we had to testify.

CLAR  - Are you stupid?

How could you think
this was a trial?

MAR Because you've got our bosses
suspended in a scary-ass beam.


CLAR  That is the beam of celebration!

BILL It is an honor
to be in this beam.

MAR Shut up, Billups!

RUTH Hey, man, this is not on us.

I mean, all of that chanting,
and the-the metal gavel?

This is, like, alien trial 101.

You raised us up on a platform
into a creepy courtroom.


CLAR  Creepy? This is one
of our nicest event silos.

- I got married here!
MAR - Wh... Well, then, who's this judge?

This guy's just been, like,
scowling at us the whole time.

CLAR - I don't know him.
OTHER DUDE - Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm just here

to set up for a birthday later
for my little girl.

- She's turning 100.
MAR - Aw.

ATTENDANT Okay, all right, Clar,
time's up.

- Etchers down.

CLAR - But-but...

we didn't even get
to do any etching.

ATTENDANT No, no, no, no. You only paid
for 22 minutes.

Other people got to etch.


CLAR Oh, come on.

MAR But-but wh... Okay, what about,
what about the eels?

You held us in contempt,
of eels.

CAP All right, come on.
That's enough.

MAR - You dipped us in eels!

CLAR - You ruined my party!

MAR Those were eels
you dipped us in!


- You did that! You did it!

CLAR - You ruined my party!

CAP Today you four almost
got yourselves killed

at a thank-you dinner.

But, the way you stood up
for Starfleet

while you thought you were
staring death in the face

deserves commendation.

I guess.

Going forward,
we'll make an effort

to keep the crew more informed.

The Cerritos will be
synonymous with clarity.

MAR Wait, so then what did
Clar do to get captured

by the Romulans?
I-I missed that part.

CAP Well, it's-it's complicated.

TEN Why did you let him
hurt us with eels

if you knew it wasn't a trial?

RAN We have to honor the local
customs of alien governments.

RUTH And can you tell me
who was on that secret team

that infiltrated
the Neutral Zone?

CAP Uh, I'm not at liberty to...

BOIM And why couldn't you just ask
the Vulcans to borrow

the Bird-of-Prey?
And where did they get it?

And why was that a job
for the Cerritos?

Why couldn't it have just been
a job for, like, the Enterprise,

- or...
CAP - Okay, you know what? It's classified.

It's all classified. Dismissed!

MAR Hey, everybody, look, we got
Captain Clarity over here.

CAP I said dismissed!

MAR Honestly, this is fine with me.
Knowing things means more work.

BOIM Well, I, for one, knew
it was a party the whole time.

MAR Yeah, right, dude.

BOIM - I did.
MAR - Then why were you crying?

BOIM I just... i-it was cold in there.

I've got sensitive corneas.
I told you.

"Q" I challenge you all to a duel.

Pick your weapons.

I pick the mind.

MAR Get out of here, Q! No.

We are done
with random stuff today.

We're not dealing
with any of your Q bull.

"Q" Oh, s'il vous plaît, Mariner.

I want to put humanity
to the ultimate test.

MAR Okay, I'm not French. No.

- Go find Picard.
"Q" - Oh, Picard.

He's no fun, he's always
quoting Shakespeare,

he's always making wine.

Chirp.

THE END
