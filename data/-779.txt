BOIM: Who knew repairing 
BOIM: the station grid 
BOIM: would involve so much sprinting? 
MAR: No talk. Sleep. 
MAR: What the (beep)? Hey, no, no. Down. 
TEN: I did it! 
TEN: I updated the dog! 
BOIM: Down. 
RUTH: What does that even mean? Hey! Mmmm. 
TEN: In Medical, 
TEN: they encourage us 
TEN: to do side projects. 
MAR: No! Why?! 
TEN: So I took a bunch of inert carbon 
TEN: and built myself a fluffy friend from scratch. 
MAR: Shut up! 
MAR: No! Aah! 
TEN: It's supposed to look like a dog. 
TEN: You know, from Earth. 
MAR: Tendi, 
MAR: please get it out of here. 
TEN: Oh, of course. 
TEN: Come here! Come here. 
TEN: Ah. 
TEN: She's five percent faster 
TEN: and six percent smarter. 
TEN: You know, I handedited 
TEN: all six billion sequences. 
TEN: It was really fun! 
MAR: When did you even find time 
MAR: for that? 
TEN: Sometimes when I say 
TEN: that I'm going to the bathroom, 
TEN: I'm really recoding her DNA. 
TEN: This little lady's protein bonds 
TEN: totally accepted 
TEN: the Cas9 snipping without 
TEN: any cellular degradation. 
TEN: Who has malleable protein bonds? 
TEN: You do. 
TEN: Yes, you do. 
MAR: I don't get it. 
RUTH: You could've built any lifeform 
RUTH: at all, and you did this? 
RUTH: It just looks like a normal dog. 
TEN: That's exactly what 
TEN: I was going for! 
TEN: I'll go grab my notes so 
TEN: I can read you the juicy parts. 
TEN: You're going to love how 
TEN: I reorganized her mitochondria. 
TEN: No spoilers, but... 
TEN: ...it's super funny! 
RUTH: Just to be clear, 
RUTH: this is a normal dog, 
RUTH: and she's messing with us. 
BOIM: Oh, God. Not a normal dog. 
MAR: Wake me up if it turns into 
MAR: something I need to care about. 
RAN: First officer's log. 
RAN: An elite team from the Cerritos 
RAN: has been selected 
RAN: by Admiral Syltrack to liaise 
RAN: with the Pisepian agricultural 
RAN: colony in disputed territory. 
RAN: Captain Freeman, Shaxs, 
RAN: and myself 
RAN: have been enlisted 
RAN: to join the mission 
RAN: due to our expertise in 
RAN: the germination of rulot seeds. 
RAN: In our absence, 
RAN: the Cerritos will receive 
RAN: a temporary transfer of command 
RAN: to a visiting captain. 
MAR: Visiting captain? 
MAR: No! So lame. 
BOIM: I figured you'd love a break 
BOIM: from our usual guys. 
BOIM: Sub caps never know 
BOIM: what they're doing. 
BOIM: They're all like, 
BOIM: "Buffer the phase coils." 
BOIM: And we're like, 
BOIM: "What are you talking about?" 
BOIM: What are you talking about? 
MAR: I don't want 
MAR: some babysitter Jellicotype 
MAR: hovering over us 
MAR: when we're already going 
MAR: to a bog planet, 
MAR: which is, like, 
MAR: the worst kind of planets, 
MAR: as far as planets go. 
BOIM: Bogs are actually fascinating. 
BOIM: Did you know 
BOIM: that the spore count can... 
MAR: I don't want to know about a bog! 
MAR: It's a gross word 
MAR: for a gross place! 
BOIM: Well, you're being 
BOIM: very unscientific. 
BOIM: Anyway, I'm into it. 
BOIM: We get to rub shoulders 
BOIM: with the visiting crew, 
BOIM: maybe impress another captain. 
MAR: Oh, you're just excited to kiss 
MAR: a whole new butt, aren't you? 
BOIM: Well, I wouldn't put it 
BOIM: like that. 
BOIM: But yes, very. 
BOIM: Hmm... 
BOIM: Rutherford! 
BOIM: The visiting crew's 
BOIM: gonna be here any minute. 
BOIM: Hey, if I part my hair 
BOIM: like this, do I look 
BOIM: more promotable or less? 
BOIM: More? Less? 
BOIM: More? Less? 
RUTH: Yeah, sure. 
BOIM: You didn't even look! 
RUTH: Sorry. 
RUTH: It's this transporter, man. 
RUTH: I'm trying to make it go 
RUTH: .07 seconds faster. 
RUTH: Mariner wouldn't help me 
RUTH: test it. 
RUTH: She said she wanted to wait 
RUTH: until I ironed out the kinks. 
RUTH: But how am I supposed to do that 
RUTH: if nobody's gonna 
RUTH: help me test it? 
BOIM: Ooh! I'll do it. 
BOIM: I can tell the new captain that, 
BOIM: in my spare time, 
BOIM: I enjoy improving efficiency. 
RUTH: Okay, cool. 
RUTH: I'll just transport you 
RUTH: back and forth 
RUTH: super quick. 
RUTH: Real easy. 
BOIM: Okay. Beam me up. 
BOIM: I mean, 
BOIM: Boim me up. 
BOIM: You know what I'm saying. 
RUTH: Okeydokey! 
RUTH: That was, like, half a second 
RUTH: faster than normal! 
RUTH: I can't believe it's working. 
BOIM: Ooh, ooh, ooh! 
BOIM: Run me through it again! 
BOIM: Do it again! Do it again! 
BOIM: Uh... 
RUTH: Aw, man. 
RUTH: I thought I solved this. 
BOIM: What?! 
RUTH: Sorry, it's just the last part 
RUTH: of the transporter process! 
RUTH: It can be a bit sticky! 
BOIM: Sticky?! Am I gonna die?! 
RUTH: No, no! You're just off by, 
RUTH: like, one millicochrane! 
RUTH: It's just cosmetic! 
BOIM: What's that noise?! 
BOIM: Is that me?! 
RUTH: You hardly notice it! 
BOIM: You got to fix me before 
BOIM: the visiting crew gets here! 
BOIM: I can't look like this! 
RUTH: What?! 
MAR: Oh, well, here we go. 
MAR: Babysitter time 
MAR: in three, two, one... 
MAR: Amina? 
AMI: There she is! 
AMI: Are you surprised? 
MAR: Oh, my gosh. I thought 
MAR: you were on the Oakland. 
AMI: Eh, couldn't pass up 
AMI: a water filtration repair. 
MAR: This is crazy! 
MAR: Wait, and you're 
MAR: a freakin' captain now? 
MAR: Get those title bumps, girl. 
AMI: Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal. 
AMI: I've even got a team. 
AMI: Warren, Prachett, Durga, 
AMI: this is my old friend 
AMI: I was telling you about. 
DUR: Captain Ramsey... speaks fondly 
DUR: of your time at the Academy. 
MAR: Oh, boy. 
MAR: What'd she tell you? 
AMI: That when it comes 
AMI: to bootsontheground 
AMI: planetary action, 
AMI: you're the best. 
AMI: And you look damn good doing it. 
DUR: Curious 
DUR: that you're still an ensign. 
BOIM: Ensign Boimler 
BOIM: reporting for duty! 
MAR: Dude! What is wrong with you?! 
BOIM: Nothing! I'm just phasing! 
BOIM: No biggie! 
MAR: Disagree! 
MAR: It's kind of a biggie! 
AMI: Ensign, report to sickbay! 
BOIM: But that's for sick people! 
AMI: Now! 
BOIM: Aw. 
T'ANA: How long is this going to last?! 
T'ANA: How am I supposed to know?! 
T'ANA: You look 
BOIM: like a goddamn science project! 
BOIM: Then... ow! why are you 
BOIM: still taking samples?! 
RUTH: I figured it out! 
BOIM: All right. 
BOIM: Boimler's back, baby! 
BOIM: Time to kiss some visiting butt. 
BOIM: Wait, I'm still all phasey. 
RUTH: Yeah. But you're 
RUTH: not making the sound anymore, 
T'ANA: which was the worst part, right? 
BOIM: Oh, yeah. That was terrible. 
BOIM: I'm literally hard to look at. 
BOIM: I mean, what if... what if... 
BOIM: Nobody wants a sparkly cap'n! 
BOIM: Oh, all right, all right. 
T'ANA: Calm down. 
T'ANA: I already alerted Division 14. 
BOIM: The time travel police? 
T'ANA: No! D14 handles 
T'ANA: unsolvable space illnesses 
T'ANA: and science mysteries. 
BOIM: And they can make me 
BOIM: a real boy again? 
T'ANA: They've got this great 
T'ANA: medical spa on Endicronimas V. 
BOIM: En... 
BOIM: Endicron... 
T'ANA: Everyone just calls it 
T'ANA: "The Farm." 
T'ANA: You'll be pampered and tended to 
T'ANA: like a precious gem. 
T'ANA: You and Mr. Whatever The Hell 
T'ANA: That Thing Is over there. 
TEN: Don't worry, The Dog. 
TEN: I won't let them hurt you. 
RUTH: Wait, you named it "The Dog"? 
TEN: Of course. Why wouldn't I? 
TEN: She's a totally normal dog. 
RUTH: Mm, I'm starting to think 
RUTH: you know more about DNA 
RUTH: than you do about dogs. 
TEN: We don't have any on Orion. 
TEN: We're really missing out. 
TEN: Dogs are great. 
TEN: Aw, look at you. 
TEN: You're just 
TEN: a cute little cinnamon roll. 
TEN: Yes, you are! 
AMI: Visiting captain's log. 
AMI: Stardate 57752.6. 
AMI: The Cerritos is en route 
AMI: to the planet Khwopa to... 
AMI: perform a repair of 
AMI: their water filtration system. 
AMI: Once completed, we will... 
AMI: rendezvous 
AMI: with the USS Rubidoux. End log. 
AMI: Will you stop it? 
MAR: Sorry, I just love 
MAR: captains' trinkets, you know? 
AMI: Come on. 
AMI: Give me the dirt. 
AMI: Have you seen 
AMI: Ransom's photon torpedo? 
MAR: Barf! No! Disgusting. 
MAR: No, for real, that is big barf. 
MAR: So, how long do we have you? 
MAR: I mean, it's gonna take a while 
MAR: to catch you up 
MAR: on all the crazy stuff 
MAR: I've been up to. 
AMI: Yeah. That's why I want you 
AMI: at my side. 
AMI: Getting your perspective 
AMI: on the Cerritos crew 
AMI: would be invaluable. 
AMI: I mean, come on, nobody likes 
AMI: a babysitter captain. 
MAR: Babysitter captain? What? 
MAR: I don't even know what that is. 
MAR: What? 
AMI: So, what do you say? 
AMI: Want to be my first officer? 
MAR: Oh! Of course! 
MAR: You've got the dream team. 
MAR: It's about time 
MAR: this bridge had a kickass crew. 
MAR: I mean, the usual guys are fine, 
MAR: but they're kind of... eh. 
MAR: Oh, wait, are... 
MAR: Wait, are you kidding? 
MAR: No, you're kidding, right? 
AMI: I'm not kidding! 
MAR: Then yes! 
AMI: All right. Let's do this... 
AMI: Number One. 
DIV: Greetings. 
DIV: I am the Division 14 
DIV: medical specialist. 
TEN: Aw, thank you. I'm Tendi, 
TEN: and this is my dog, The Dog. 
TEN: And let the record show 
TEN: we're here under protest. 
DIV: I must warn you, 
DIV: stepping aboard this vessel 
DIV: is consent 
DIV: to be surrounded 
DIV: by dark abnormalities 
DIV: and the clinically obscene. 
BOIM: Uh, how long will it take 
BOIM: to get to the spa? 
BOIM: I wasn't sure 
BOIM: how many books to bring. 
DIV: Do not trouble yourself 
DIV: with the journey. 
DIV: The Farm cures all. 
AMI: So, we were surrounded 
AMI: by four Borg, right? 
AMI: And nobody ever talks 
AMI: about this, but they smell 
AMI: like old trash bags. 
DUR: What? Four? How'd you get out? 
AMI: It required unorthodox tactics. 
AMI: Durga kicked their butts 
AMI: with Vulcan jujitsu. 
MAR: Yeah, well, 
MAR: this one time, Ramsey and I 
MAR: stole Professor Rubichik's 
MAR: old, special car 
MAR: and drove it into the bay. 
MAR: It was hilarious. 
MAR: He was so pissed. 
PRA: I love Saul Rubichek. 
PRA: He was my mentor at the Academy. 
PRA: That car was his life. 
PRA: I spoke at his funeral. 
AMI: Uh, well, that was a long time ago. 
MAR: I still do stuff like that 
MAR: all the time. 
MAR: Last week, I put a scorpion 
MAR: in Ransom's bed. 
MAR: It was bad. He almost died. 
DUR: Do you often disrupt missions? 
MAR: No, I mean, I do 
MAR: regular Starfleet stuff, too. 
AMI: Everyone ready? 
AMI: Let's roll out. 
AMI: Reports indicate 
AMI: that first contact here 
AMI: was a little tricky. 
AMI: The bogs didn't help. 
AMI: Let's see if we can get ahold 
AMI: of the local authorities. 
MAR: Copy that. 
WAR: Hey, are you 
WAR: on a different mission, 
WAR: or are you coming with us? 
MAR: Oh. Uh, sorry. Right. 
MAR: I'll just, uh... 
AMI: When we're done here, 
AMI: you'll be back to enjoying 
AMI: crystal clear water, 
AMI: King Phibeas. 
KING: We osmose 
KING: our most brackish gratitude. 
MAR: So, uh, you and Ramsey 
MAR: are pretty tight, huh? 
MAR: How'd you guys meet? 
DUR: I do not believe 
DUR: that information 
DUR: has any bearing 
DUR: on our current objective. 
MAR: Damn, Durga. 
MAR: I was just making chitchat. 
COMPUTER: Critical overpressure. 
PRA: One of the cascade valves 
PRA: must be jammed open! 
PRA: We've got 30 seconds 
PRA: till the whole system blows! 
DUR: Mariner, the tricorders. 
MAR: Um, uh, I... 
MAR: You know, I think I left them 
MAR: in the transporter room. 
AMI: Try clearing it 
AMI: with a subsonic pulse. 
MAR: I must have grabbed 
MAR: the wrong crate. 
MAR: II left all our tricorders 
MAR: back on the Cerritos. 
DUR: Which is the least useful place 
DUR: for them to be, 
DUR: First Officer Mariner. 
CAP: Captain Ramsey, 
CAP: I just wanted to take 
CAP: a brief pause 
CAP: from our covert operation 
CAP: to check in 
CAP: on my ship. 
AMI: The Cerritos and her crew 
AMI: have performed admirably, 
AMI: Captain Freeman. 
AMI: We've repaired the waste pipe 
AMI: on Khwopa 
AMI: and are waiting on the Rubidoux. 
CAP: Very good. I've got to go. 
CAP: These rulot seeds 
CAP: are highly volatile. 
CAP: I may be called to plant them 
CAP: at any moment. 
AMI: Godspeed, Captain. 
AMI: Okay, so, 
AMI: they might plant seeds? 
AMI: Well, sounds like they're 
AMI: on a very important mission. 
DUR: Strange. The Rubidoux 
DUR: should have arrived by now. 
AMI: Well, Captain Dayton 
AMI: isn't exactly punctual, 
AMI: but we may as well follow up. 
AMI: Initiate longrange scan. 
AMI: Mariner, 
AMI: if you don't mind? 
MAR: Oh! Me. 
MAR: Right. Sure thing. 
MAR: Uh, here we go. 
MAR: Ah! Uh, ssorry! Hold on. Uh... 
DUR: Perhaps Mariner isn't as apt 
DUR: as you recall. 
MAR: Nobody move! Just wait. It'll... 
MAR: It'll tire itself out. 
AMI: Hey. 
AMI: Just breathe. You've got this. 
MAR: Uh... 
BOIM: Huh. 
BOIM: Wow, I never knew there were 
BOIM: this many accidents 
BOIM: in Starfleet. 
HALF: Which is exactly why 
HALF: Division 14 exists: 
HALF: to hide the mistakes 
HALF: Starfleet would like to ignore. 
TEN: Oh, well, that doesn't sound very Starfleety. 
HALF: The admirals 
HALF: wouldn't want to jeopardize 
HALF: the allegiance of their officers 
HALF: by forcing them 
HALF: to work alongside 
HALF: a man whose body is equal parts 
HALF: accelerated growth 
HALF: and reverse aging. 
HALF: That's right. Stare at me. 
TEN: II wasn't sstaring. 
HALF: The freak 
HALF: infected by an alien horse bite, 
HALF: doomed to live out his days 
HALF: as half a rascal. 
HALF: Everyone would rather avert 
HALF: their gaze instead of curing us. 
HALF: We're inconvenient. 
HALF: But aren't there specialists 
BOIM: who specialize in this? 
HALF: Tell that to Ensign Jenna, 
HALF: exposed to delta radiation. 
HALF: Or Ellis and Sanderson. 
HALF: Neutrino field 
HALF: transporter accident. 
ELLIS: We have two of everything. 
SANDERSON: Almost everything. 
HALF: And Anthony. 
HALF: Hi, Anthony. 
HALF: Did it used to be a man? 
HALF: Yeah, 
HALF: that's what we're assuming. 
TEN: Don't worry, The Dog. You don't 
TEN: belong here with these freaks. 
TEN: I'll break you out 
TEN: first chance I get. 
BOIM: Come on, you're making it 
BOIM: sound worse than it is. 
BOIM: I mean, we're all going 
BOIM: to a resort planet 
BOIM: with gentle nurses and whatnot. 
BOIM: It's gonna be great. 
HALF: The Farm? 
HALF: You really think they're 
HALF: taking us to a paradise planet? 
BOIM: Wait, yeah. I... 
BOIM: Then where are we going? 
HALF: Nowhere. 
HALF: We've been here for months. 
HALF: This is The Farm! 
BARNES: It's the Rubidoux, Captain. 
BARNES: All systems 
BARNES: appear to be offline. 
AMI: I told Dayton to get her energy 
AMI: coils replaced last month. 
AMI: Looks like I was right. 
AMI: If power's out, they're probably 
AMI: holed up in a safe room, 
AMI: waiting for rescue, 
AMI: just like last time. 
AMI: Durga, Mariner, Warren, 
AMI: you're with me. 
AMI: Let's give them a jump. 
DUR: Power has been interrupted 
DUR: in engineering. 
AMI: Durga, get the main systems 
AMI: back on line. 
AMI: Mariner and I will figure out 
AMI: where the crew is holed up. 
DUR: Should be a simple repair 
DUR: for me, Captain. 
AMI: Check in every 15 minutes. 
AMI: Oh, and someone make sure 
AMI: to get a picture of me 
AMI: and Captain Dayton 
AMI: when she thanks me 
AMI: for saving her ass again. 
MAR: Sorry. Uh, new boots. 
AMI: Wait is going on with you? 
AMI: I really need you to step it up. 
MAR: Sorry. Yeah, no, I'll do better. 
MAR: You know, it's these darn boots. 
MAR: These boots are, like... 
MAR: I got... I... 
MAR: Well, I wanted to get, 
MAR: like, a taller boot. 
AMI: Stop with the boots! 
TEN: What's up, girl? 
TEN: What's wrong? You... 
TEN: You want walkies? 
TEN: Oh, come on. Let's go. 
HALF: Listen up. 
HALF: There's a shift change at 0200. 
HALF: It's our chance 
HALF: to take the ship. 
BOIM: You're talking about a mutiny. 
HALF: Exactly. 
HALF: We'll find our own planet 
HALF: where we won't be treated like 
HALF: failed science experiments. 
HALF: Tonight, freaks fight back! 
HALF: Freaks fight back! 
HALF: Freaks fight back! 
HALF: Brother, freaks united 
HALF: are freaks no more. 
HALF: Say it with me. 
HALF: Freaks fight back! 
BOIM: Yeah. Freaks fight back. 
HALF: Freaks fight back! 
FREAKS: Freaks fight back! 
BOIM: Freaks fight back! 
BOIM: ...is what they were all 
BOIM: chanting. We were all doing it 
BOIM: in unison. 
DIV: Mutiny? On my ship? 
DIV: How dare they! 
BOIM: Sir, they just want 
BOIM: more information. 
BOIM: I think if we all sat down 
BOIM: in a conference room 
BOIM: and talked it out... 
DIV: If those freaks 
DIV: think they can mutiny, 
DIV: they're in for a rude awakening. 
BOIM: No, no, no! The only reason I 
BOIM: told you is so nobody gets hurt. 
BOIM: We're all Starfleet. 
BOIM: We have to follow the rules. 
DIV: I am the rules. 
BOIM: Wait! 
BOIM: We can talk this out! Sir! 
BOIM: Don't tell them I tattled! 
BOIM: Don't tell them I tattled! 
MAR: Um, hello? 
MAR: Hello, Rubidoux people? Hello? 
MAR: Oh, where are these guys? 
MAR: How do you do this every day? 
MAR: It is so boring. 
AMI: You used to love 
AMI: space mysteries. 
MAR: Yeah. I used to be dumb. 
AMI: That's one way to look at it. 
MAR: What does that mean? 
AMI: I expected 
AMI: to be working with 
AMI: the capable Starfleet badass 
AMI: I knew at the Academy, 
AMI: not whatever you are now. 
MAR: Yeah, and I expected to be 
MAR: working with my fun friend, 
MAR: not a total... 
AMI: Hold it. 
AMI: These doors 
AMI: have been manually sealed. 
DAYTON: I don't want to die. 
MAR: Stand down. We're Starfleet. 
DAYTOON: I don't want to die. I don't want to die. 
MAR: Captain Dayton. 
MAR: Whoa, Captain, Captain, 
MAR: you're gonna be okay. 
DAYTON: No! That thing is still 
DAYTON: out there! 
MAR: There's nothing outside 
MAR: except the Cerritos. 
DAYTON: You don't understand! 
DAYTON: We're inside of it! 
HALF: It's time. 
HALF: Let's shake the ship! 
DIV: What do you think you're doing? 
HALF: Uh... nothing. 
DIV: Mutiny makes you traitors! 
HALF: Mutiny? 
HALF: No, these are just props 
HALF: that we're using for our... 
HALF: our musical, right, guys? 
DIV: Stop lying! Boimler told me 
DIV: everything! Brad Boimler. 
BOIM: Ooh, no, no, no. 
DIV: Right there... Brad Boimler. 
HALF: Boimler, what the hell?! 
BOIM: Freaks fight back? 
DIV: From now on, everyone is 
DIV: confined to their quarters. 
DIV: I suggest 
DIV: you spend the time alone, 
DIV: thinking about how 
DIV: to be more like Brad. 
BOIM: Wait, wait, wait. I have no idea 
BOIM: how he found out, guys. 
BOIM: That's crazy. 
HALF: Get the rat! 
HALF: Get him! 
HALF: Guys, no. Help! So many freaks! 
DAYTON: We shut down systems 
DAYTON: because it feeds on electricity. 
AMI: Durga, do not restore power. 
AMI (DISTORTED): Durga, Durga... 
AMI (DISTORTED): restore power. 
DUR: Captain, artificial gravity 
DUR: is coming back on line. 
AMI: What the hell?! 
AMI: Oh, stop it! 
AMI: Stop it! Stop it! 
AMI: How big is this thing? 
AMI: All right, everyone with me. 
AMI: We need to stay calm. 
AMI: Hallway, now! 
AMI: Ramsey to Cerritos. 
AMI: Prepare for emergency transport. 
AMI: Damn thing must be 
AMI: blocking signals. 
DAYTON: I don't want to die in space! 
DAYTON: I don't want to die in space! 
DAYTON: We're all gonna... 
MAR: Pick her up. 
MAR: We have to get to the bridge. 
MAR: That's where we beamed in. 
MAR: There's a good chance we can still get a signal out. 
MAR: Ugh. 
AMI: Where has this Mariner been 
AMI: all day? 
MAR: I don't know what you're talking about. 
AMI: No, no, no, no. 
AMI: Something's going on here. 
AMI: Been nonstop screwing up, 
AMI: then suddenly, you're back 
AMI: to taking charge and 
AMI: punching out captains and... 
AMI: Wait a minute. 
MAR: Maybe let's talk, like, after 
MAR: the giant space emergency. 
AMI: You were taking a dive, 
AMI: weren't you? 
AMI: You figured out I was gonna 
AMI: offer you a spot on the Oakland. 
MAR: Yeah, well, maybe 
MAR: I didn't want my best friend 
MAR: trying to trick me 
MAR: into a job I didn't want. 
MAR: You ever think of that? 
AMI: Ugh! 
AMI: We all thought you'd be the 
AMI: first captain from our class. 
AMI: You got the best grades, 
AMI: you kept us all on track. 
AMI: Now it seems like 
AMI: you don't even like Starfleet. 
MAR: You used to do whatever 
MAR: you wanted whenever you wanted. 
MAR: Now you got to check in 
MAR: with Durga every five minutes. 
AMI: Because I love leading a team 
AMI: that puts their trust in me. 
MAR: Fine, but I don't love 
MAR: that everyone's 
MAR: always screaming at me 
MAR: to rank up and take charge. 
MAR: Why can't I just be 
MAR: a super great ensign? 
AMI: Look, how about you stop 
AMI: pretending to be a dumbass, 
AMI: and I'll stop trying 
AMI: to recruit you, 
AMI: and we can go save these people? 
MAR: Deal! 
HALF: Got you. 
ALF: A rat trapped in an airlock. 
HALF: That sounds about right. 
HALF: Any last words? 
BOIM: Please don't hurt me. 
BOIM: Please don't hurt me! 
BOIM: I'm just a freak like you, see? 
BOIM: It wore off! 
BOIM: I'm not a freak anymore! 
HALF: Hey, would you look at that! 
HALF: Great! 
HALF: You're normal now. 
HALF: Enjoy your walk in space. 
BOIM: Wait. Why is the air not 
BOIM: being forced from my lungs? 
BOIM: The Farm! It's real? 
DIV: Isn't it beautiful? 
DIV: The missions might be long, 
DIV: but it's worth it 
DIV: every time we get back. 
HALF: Ooh! Do I have egg on my face. 
HALF: Sir, I'm sorry for the whole... 
HALF: mutiny thing. 
DIV: I get it. 
DIV: The Farm does seem unbelievable. 
DIV: No, I'm sorry I reacted 
DIV: the way I did. 
DIV: We should have just 
DIV: talked it out. 
BOIM: Which is what I said 
BOIM: we should do! 
DIV: Next time, we'll avoid 
DIV: a mutiny before it happens. 
DIV: Maybe paint the ship 
DIV: some friendlier colors, 
DIV: turn on some lights 
DIV: so it isn't so creepy. 
DIV: Enjoy your path 
DIV: to recovery, my friends. 
DIV: Oh, it's just the way I laugh. 
TEN: This is where 
TEN: we have to say goodbye. 
TEN: I never wanted to leave you. 
TEN: You're not a freak. 
TEN: You're just a good dog. 
TEN: I will never give up trying 
TEN: to get you back home. 
DOG: Tendi, you have been 
DOG: an exemplary creator. 
DOG: But do not cry. 
DOG: I like it here! 
DOG: There's far more space to run 
DOG: and many fascinating things 
DOG: upon which to urinate. 
TEN: Oh, wow. 
TEN: I'm so glad you're happy! 
TEN: Well, The Dog, 
DOG: then I guess this is goodbye. 
DOG: Farewell, Tendi. 
DOG: May the suns shine upon you. 
BOIM: Wait. You knew 
BOIM: she could talk and walk? 
TEN: Yeah, of course she can talk. 
TEN: She's a dog. 
BOIM: Normal dogs don't do any of that stuff. 
TEN: They don't? 
TEN: Wait. But normal dogs 
TEN: hover and spit lightning, right? 
BOIM: No, none of that! 
TEN: Oh! 
TEN: Well, then this is starting 
TEN: to make a lot more sense. 
TEN: Hey, you are a freak. 
DOG: I know! 
DOG: I just didn't want you to worry. 
TEN: Oh, she's such a good girl. 
NURSE: Oh, we call dibs on this cutie. 
HALF: Oh. 
HALF: No, he shouldn't 
HALF: even be here. 
HALF: He's not a freak anymore. 
NURSE: You're not? 
BOIM: I, uh, I have acid reflux. 
BOIM: That's kind of freakish. 
BOIM: Wait, wait, wait! 
BOIM: No. 
MAR: Not today, snot! 
AMI: Durga, report. 
DUR: There's some sort of alien 
DUR: entity inside the ship. 
MAR: Oh, you think? 
MAR: Okay, everybody, 
MAR: we're gonna get you out of here. 
AMI: Warren, beam us out of here. 
WAR: I'm trying. There's too many. 
WAR: Wewe won't have time. 
MAR: Rutherford! 
MAR: We need your transporter 
MAR: thing up and running now! 
RUTH: It made Boimler weird! 
MAR: Boim us out of here! 
RUTH: Hold on! 
MAR: Rutherford! 
RUTH: Come on, baby. 
RUTH: Give Rutherford the juice! 
MAR: Oh, man, I knew 
MAR: you could do it, Ruthy! 
AMI: Why are we still in phase? 
RUTH: Ah, it's just cosmetic. 
AMI: It's just cosmetic. 
AMI: Captain's log. 
AMI: The evacuation of the U.S.S. 
AMI: Rubidoux was a success, 
AMI: thanks to the quick thinking 
AMI: of the Cerritos crew. 
AMI: While the exact classification 
AMI: of this space entity eludes us, 
AMI: we believe it to be peaceful, 
AMI: in search of a home. 
RUTH: You're cured? 
RUTH: I mean, see? 
RUTH: I knew you'd be fine. 
BOIM: Listen, you got 
BOIM: to mess me up again. 
BOIM: Not permanently, but maybe, 
BOIM: like, a nice twoweek freak. 
RUTH: I have been tinkering 
RUTH: with some ancient plasmas. 
TEN: Aw. Good afternoon. 
TEN: I'm Tendi. 
TEN: How are you today? 
TEN: Ugh. Ugh! 
TEN: Ugh! She licked me. 
TEN: What a weirdo! 
AMI: Would you look at that? 
AMI: Nothing like a big, 
AMI: crazy alien to remind you 
AMI: why "space explorer" is 
AMI: such a great gig. 
MAR: Yeah, it's the best. 
AMI: Well, Starfleet isn't perfect, 
AMI: but my offer still stands. 
AMI: If you want a chance to lead 
AMI: by example, I'd have your back. 
MAR: Yeah, if I was gonna rank up 
MAR: for anyone, it would be you, 
MAR: but, you know, I still have 
MAR: some stuff to figure out 
MAR: while I'm lower decks, 
MAR: about who I want to be. 
MAR: Like, maybe I'll buckle down 
MAR: and become a captain. 
MAR: Maybe I won't. 
MAR: Probably won't. 
MAR: I just need time to find me. 
AMI: I know you will. 
RAN: Well, well, well, 
RAN: beautiful Captain Ramsey. 
RAN: I'd love to buy you a drink. 
AMI: Oh. Sorry, Ransom. 
AMI: Instincts kicked in. 
AMI: I'll take a pass on that drink. 
RAN: Good one, Ramsey. 
RAN: That's our thing. 
RAN: She's kidding.
