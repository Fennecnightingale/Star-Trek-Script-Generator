PART ONE 

SAR Battle stations, report.

OWO Shields at maximum, sir.

NUM Weapons armed and ready,
Captain.

PKE Transmit to all ships.

This is Captain Pike.

We have one job:

get Commander Burnham and Discovery
through the wormhole.

Section 31 is in our way.

Once Burnham launches
in the suit,

Second Squadron
will match course and speed

to cover her
and defend her perimeter.

Squadrons Three and Four will
be the front line of defense

against the Section 31 fleet.

You will lead the attack
and draw their fire

to give us the time we need.

Enterprise will maintain fire
on the fleet

to cause distraction
for as long as we can.

But as soon as Burnham
is detected out there,

we have to keep her safe.

All shuttles and pods,
use attack formation Gamma Six.

Squadrons One and Three,
coordinate positions

to disrupt and target
all main enemy vessels.

This is Starfleet.

Get it done.

Mr. Saru, ETA on that suit.

SAR The components are
being synthesized

and assembled as we speak.

BRN Don't adjust
the composite automatically.

I'll do it manually after each
piece is cleared for assembly.

SPK I'm not detecting
any micro-variances.

NIL No, I need a surgical spanner,

not a standard
engineering coupler.

STA Stop. Look me in the eyes.

The silicon injectors
need to be purged

after each binding is molded.
Watch me.

NAHN The bayonet joint on this
oxygen sensor's wide open.

Are you trying to kill her?

CREWMAN - Oh, shit.
BRN Get off the assembly.

I got it.
CREWMAN - Sorry, Commander.

PKE High speed, low drag, Commander.
The longer it takes her

to open that wormhole,
the fewer make it home. 

NUM Yes, sir.

What's the Intel on how much
perimeter space she'll need

to get far enough away
from that wormhole?

DET Commander Burnham
needs to remain

at the outermost radius
of the battle

 at .0004 arc-seconds.
NUM  In English, please.

I can't blow a path
through what you're saying.

DET Tight enough so none
of the Section 31 ships

get pulled into the future,
loose enough so none of our guys

get destroyed by
the event horizon.

SAR Lieutenant Spock will remain on
comms throughout to guide her.

BRN Reno, where are we
with the time crystal?

JET Four minutes, 18 seconds away
until fully charged.

BRN Can you cut that in half?

JET Violate the basic laws
of physics?

Uh, no.

RHYS Commander, we've scanned
the Section 31 armada.

There's only one life sign:
Captain Leland's.

The rest of the ships are empty.

GRG Drones. Nasty ones.

SAR Lieutenant Bryce, have you had
any success reaching Starfleet?

BRY Subspace relays are
still down, Commander.

Attempting to circumvent,
but we're still being jammed.

SAR It is just us.

TLY Any, uh, words of wisdom?

SAR "Be extremely subtle,

"even to the point
of formlessness.

"Be extremely mysterious,

even to the point
of soundlessness."

GRG "Thereby you can be the director

of your opponent's fate."

I'm surprised a Kelpien,
of all beings,

has studied Sun Tzu.

SAR I am surprised a Terran
is surprised by anything.

BRY Incoming hail.

It's Leland, sir.

SAR You will see a human face.

It is not a human being.

Am I clear?

ALL Yes, sir.
SAR Put it through.

GRG Leland, we were just
talking about you.

Everybody hates you.

Congratulations.

CTRL LEL You know why I'm here.

Give me what I've come for,

or die for it.

SAR By authority granted me under
the Articles of the Federation

and Starfleet Charter,

I order you
to surrender your vessels.

No terms, no deals.

PKE Last warning.

CTRL LEL Transmit the data to me,

or you'll be destroyed.

GRG By my count, we have
over 200 vessels,

and you might have 30.

CTRL LEL Count again.

RHYS Multiple torpedoes locked on us.
SAR Evasive pattern Delta Five.
DET Aye, sir.

PKE All power to forward shields.
Fire full spread.

PKE Damage report. 
OPS Breach in section two.

Decks nine and ten.
Seven confirmed dead.

MANN Shields at 86%.

OWO Shields at 82%.

BRY We have a breach on deck 12.

Emergency bulkheads
engaged successfully.

NAHN I've got a leg panel. 
SPK Back plate complete.

BRN We need an adjustment on 1.0,
2.3 and 4.2.

STA I'm on it. I got it.

BRN Reno, we need that
time crystal now.

JET One minute away.
Charge at 98%.

PKE All squadrons on those drones
immediately!

PO Captain Pike, it's Po.
Do you copy?

PKE Pull her up.

NUM She's flying directly
beneath them.

PKE Give me her shuttle feed.

Your Highness,

uh, who told you you could
fly a Federation vessel?

PO First, I invoke
diplomatic immunity

for stealing this shuttle.

PKE All due respect, Your Highness,
get out of there.

PO Captain, listen,

your squadron's gonna
get obliterated.

PKE What?

PO I thought these drones
looked off-key.

They have a refracted lattice
shield design.

You can see it
in the wave patterns.

They can't be
defeated one-on-one.

Attack has to be two at a time,

targeting port and starboard
emitters simultaneously.

PKE Po, are you sure?

PO I'll put my life on it.

PKE All squadrons...

formation Double Alpha.

Team up and begin
target acquisition.

Follow the queen.

SAR Mr. Rhys,

set all phasers
for automatic targeting,

maximum power and range.
RHYS  Aye, Commander.

SAR Owo, bring the emergency
generators on line.

OWO Shields holding at 70%.

GRG Leland won't destroy this ship
immediately.

He'll cripple us
and take the data.

Then he'll break
Discovery down for parts.

SAR Do you have anything
relevant to offer?

GRG Invite him aboard.

SAR Whatever you have in mind,

this is not
a two-pronged mission.

The first priority is to get

Discovery to safety
with Commander Burnham.

GRG For you, perhaps.

You should know me
well enough by now to know

I leave very little to chance.

Especially when it
comes to revenge.

JET Good to go.

Crystal's fully charged.

SAR Ensign Tilly, go with her
and make sure

it gets to
Commander Burnham safely.

JET He means in case one of us
gets dead along the way.

SAR Hurry!

JET I'm going, I'm going.
Get off my ass.

Sir. Get off my ass, sir.

NUM What the hell?

PKE They're gonna make a run on
weakening Discovery’s shields.

Divert all power
to starboard shield deflectors.

Number One, bring us around
and place us between

those drones and Discovery.
NUM Aye, Captain.

OWO Shields down to 54%
and dropping fast.

PKE Lieutenant Mann,
target the largest 31 vessel

and fire on their shield generators.
MANN Aye, Captain.

PKE The entire fleet is
receiving signals

from Leland inside that ship.

BRN Has the shuttle bay
been evacuated?

STA Yes, Commander.

The housing is prepped.

I need that last panel.

SPK Right here.

Michael?

BRN I'm good. You?

You okay?
NAHN Yeah.

Everybody. Reno?

JET I'm a cat. Five more
lives at least.

BRN Hey. You okay?

TLY We're good.

BRN Oh, no!

No, Commander!
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

JET Take this.

Get him to sickbay.

I'm gonna clean up this mess

so nobody else gets impaled.

You're okay.

SPK Michael.

Michael.
BRN Let's go.

ADM Shields unable
to absorb full impact.

Shields?

NUM We're at 60%. Discovery’s at 38.

At this rate, neither ship is
gonna last much longer.

PKE We're not on our heels yet.
Maintain offensive focus.

Make them come to us.

PART TWO 

POL Commander,
we are overloaded in sickbay.

NURSE ONE Class four casualties in here,
class three in the corridor.

Cortical stimulation's failing!

NURSE TWO Any free hands to help us
down here?

POL Hey, I need that bio-bed.

SAR I am sorry, Doctor.

All personnel on board
are occupied.

Do your best.

POL No, I'm gonna do
a half-assed job,

because now's the perfect time.

SPK The suit is ready.

Are you?

It's your mother, and it's you.

Trust what you've done together.

BRN I do.

Damn.

You will be the target
out there.

I'll pilot a shuttle
to make sure

you reach the perimeter point.

BRN What are you talking about?

You're supposed to
guide me by comms.

You can't protect me in that.
SPK There is no time for debate.

I will return to Discovery

as soon as you open
the wormhole.

I said...

BRN I heard you.

You better.

SPK Stay in my wake.

Discovery bridge,
this is Lieutenant Spock.

Prepare to lower
shuttle bay force field

and drop aft shields
for 3.5 seconds on my mark.

SAR Understood, Lieutenant.
Captain Pike,

we are preparing
to lower aft shields.

Cover fire would be
most appreciated.

PKE We got you, Saru.

All vessels.
CREWMAN Yes, Captain.

PKE We've calculated
that Commander Burnham

will need two minutes
and 47 seconds to reach

safe distance
and open the wormhole.

All squadrons, form
a tactical escort around her

on her path
and screen enemy fire.

I want a cocoon around her until
she gets to her destination.
PO On it, Captain.
If she doesn't make it

off the battlefield
and far enough away

to open the wormhole,
neither do we.

SAR Lower shields in five.

Four.

Three.

Two. One.

COMP Interstellar debris density:

72% above nominal.

Scanning for nominal
local coordinates.

SPK Michael.

BRN I'm okay.

I got this.

PKE All battle groups...

form a shield wall
against those ships.

Maintain protective formations.

Discovery and Enterprise
will lead.

Nobody gets through us until
Burnham reaches her target.

OWO Commander, sensors are
showing that something

beamed aboard
while our shields were down.

NAHN He's going for the Sphere data.

Everybody, stay here.
GRG Like hell.

AMIN Sir.

Sensors show Captain Leland
beamed aboard Discovery.

PKE We'd have to lower our own
shields to beam a team on board.

ADM Discovery
would have to lower theirs.

We can't do it, Chris.

PKE I know.

GRG I will override
the security codes.

You try accessing
the lock mechanism directly.

NAHN How much longer
before you gain entry?

PKE Five minutes.

Less if you stop bothering us.

OWO Commander, shields down to 38%.

SAR Hold the line, Lieutenant.

OWO Yes, sir.

GRG After we are done
breaking and entering,

would you like to join me
in making Leland scream?

NAHN Yum, yum.

SPK We are at a safe distance,
Michael.

BRN Understood.

Stand by.

HLM COMP Insufficient vertices
calculated.

Temporal interface access
standing by.

BRN It's not working.

Navigational system's stuck

in the present;
it won't move forward.

Why won't it move forward?

NUM Captain.

An undetonated photon torpedo

has breached the hull.

If it blows,

it'll rip a hole four decks wide
in our saucer section.

BRN Everything I saw...

this is how it starts.

I saw this exact moment

when I touched the crystal.

PKE Was that torpedo lodged,
Lieutenant? And is it live?

AMIN Deck five, section two.

And yes, sir.

PKE Lower blast shields
five and two.

Lieutenant Mann,
deploy the DOT Sevens.

MANN Aye, Captain. 
PKE I want them standing
by for repair.

Lieutenant Amin, can we seal off

the bay where the
torpedo landed?

AMIN Only one of the
blast shields'll drop, Captain.

The other one's jammed.

ADM Lieutenant Nicola, do we have
anyone from Munitions available?

NICOLA All occupied, Admiral.

I'll fix the door on-site.

ADM Get me a PADD.

Number One, I'm with you.

We'll have to disarm
simultaneously.

Figure out what kind of weapon

we're dealing with
and send me the schematics.

NICOLA Yes, ma'am.

OWO Shield-emitter in zones five
and seven are damaged.

DET We'll break into pieces

if we go into the wormhole
without shields.

RHYS If we even get there.

Come on, Burnham.

BRN Spock, the navigation interface
still won't let me set

a destination point
in the future.

SPK Without a destination point,

we will not be able
to open the wormhole.

Michael.
BRN No.

Nothing.

If I set the signals,
why can't I move us forward?

There have been seven signals
and we have only seen five.

Why would I bring us
all this way to get

stuck in this moment
and die here?

NAHN Door's almost open.

RHYS Squadrons four through nine
are down.

We're losing too many fighters.

DET Life support failing
on decks seven through 13.

OWO Shields at 11% and dropping.

Ten percent... we're at nine.

SAR All remaining power
to forward shields.

Come about starboard 90 degrees.

OWO We have an incoming
energy signature.

It's massive.

RHYS It's a Klingon cleave ship, sir.

But I'm detecting non-Klingon
power signatures, too.

SAR Those are Ba'ul fighters.

BRY We're being hailed, Commander.

SAR Put it through.
SIR Yes, sir.

Brother.

Siranna.

I received your message.

I will never again
let you fight alone.

SAR You...

have learned to pilot a fighter.

SIR We were on our way
when one of your crew

hailed us to unify our efforts.

SAR Who?

CONN Captain, we're being hailed
by the Klingons.

PKE On screen.

ASH Sorry it took us a while
to get here, Captain.

PKE Calvary arrived just in time.

I see you've brought
some new friends.

LRL Not the term I would choose,
Captain.

However, the Klingon Empire
will always

fight to preserve our future.

PKE Works for me.

LRL The D7 will arrive
momentarily, Captain.

Please transmit
tactical analysis

of all enemy vessels to us.

PKE Stand by for transfer.

LRL Fire on the armada. Destroy everything. 

KLINGON OPS Yes, my Chancellor. 

LRL Today is a good day to die. 

KLINGONS (ALL) Today is a good day to die!

SAR Siranna, the drones
have altered course

to intercept your fleet.

Promise me you will be safe.

SIR I can promise you
that I will fight

as a Kelpien, Saru.

Warriors of Kaminar,

hold your course
and calculate target locks.

SAR All ships.

The Klingons and Kelpiens
have joined our fight.

Transmit encrypted data
on the enemy fleet

and advise all squad commanders

to coordinate their efforts
with our new allies.

SPK Michael, the Ba'ul ships

arrived here piloted
by the Kelpiens

because your signal led
Discovery to Kaminar. 

BRN Not now, Spock.

SPK Yes, now. Precisely now.

The signal's purpose was not
simply to liberate the Kelpiens

but to prepare them for this.
For this very moment.

You used each signal
to lead Discovery

to an element we would need
to win this battle.

BRN Starting with Reno
on the asteroid.

SPK And to Boreth,
to acquire the time crystal.

To Xahea to find the one woman

in all the universe
who could power it.

And to Terralysium
to identify safe harbor

once we're through the wormhole.

BRN I saw us fail.

I saw everyone die.

SPK The crystal showed you
a possible future.

To avoid it.

We assumed I jumped
from somewhere in the future

to set the signals,
we didn't know from where.

BRN I jumped from here.

From this moment.

SPK That is correct.

In order for us to push forward,
you must go back

and set the events of the past
in motion,

which you have not yet done.

BRN Right.

Because we've been stuck
in an open loop

in this time, this time.

I have all the pieces
to close it.

SPK Once you do,
Control cannot evolve.

BRN So I'll go back to the asteroid
and set the first signal

and then set all the rest again.

SPK They will lead you back here.

BRN And then do you believe
we'll be able to go

to the future we want?

SPK Of that, I cannot be certain.

BRN So you're asking me
to take a leap of faith.

SPK One that is only logical.

PART THREE 

COMP Unable to locate Sphere data.

GRG I know where it is.

Leland, you look well.

NAHN For a couple of batteries
and a data core

stuffed in a meat sack.

GRG Kind of like an A.I. sausage.Ew.

CTRL LEL Women, stop talking.

GRG Remember this?

CTRL LEL That's a quantum signal
amplifier.

I gave it to you to transfer

the Sphere data to my ship.

I assume you're holding it
now to demonstrate...

GRG Why you won't find
the Sphere data anywhere here.

CTRL LEL Where can I access my data?

GRG Your data?
Hmm.

NAHN So many fun ways
to answer that question.

NUM Torpedo's in there.

It's safe to enter.

PKE Number One, status update.

NUM On-site, Captain.

The blast door is jammed.

Its release mechanism is fried.

I'm trying to override
the primary circuits

and reroute through
secondary relays.

PKE Admiral, how are things
on your end?

ADM Bad.

PKE Define "bad," please, Admiral.

Secondary detonation's
already been triggered.

I'd say about 15 minutes before
it takes out half the ship.

NURSE ONE What about the
injured on deck 12?

POL We get them stable,
we get them out. You got it?

NURSE ONE On it.

WOMAN Dr. Pollard!

POL Bio-bed.
Okay.

Easy, easy.

MAN Dr. Pollard.

POL You, over there.
Take bed two.

I could use an extra hand here.

NIL I got this.
Get back to the bridge.

Tilly, go.

Go.

POL Nilsson, now!

TLY I'm sorry, Commander, I'm...

HUGH Paul?

STA Hi.

Hugh?
Hi.

But...

HUGH I know you're in a lot of pain.

Paul,

your injuries

are pretty severe.
I'm going to induce coma.

You'll be fine.

Just listen to my voice.
You can hear me.

I thought I could make
my home on Enterprise.

You're doing fine.

Then I realized that,
uh, you're my home.

So I came back.

Everything...

always...
came back around to you.

I'm just sorry it took me
so long to see it.

So you go to sleep now, okay?

And you let me take care of you.

I'm your family.

Wherever we go from here...

we go together.

BRN I've set all my jumps.

All five. I think...

SPK The future is still
unwritten, Michael.

The outcome can still change.

BRN Spock!

SPK Go, Michael! Now!

BRN First signal.

Destination point: USS Hiawatha.

Stardate: 1025.19.

PKE This little dot

is the only one willing
to tell us where it is.

It appears to be
an interstellar asteroid.

The USS Hiawatha,
thought destroyed

by the Klingons ten months ago.

Man, they came down hard.

JET I'm Commander Jett Reno,
Engineering.

Second signal.

HLM COMP Terralysium. Stardate: 1027.32.

DET In 64 minutes the radiation
will reach the upper atmosphere,

causing an extinction
level event.

SAR If we were brought here,

perhaps this is why.

Discovery will not allow
a catastrophe on her watch.

DET The asteroid successfully
diverted

all the debris
from the planet's atmosphere.

CTRL LEL Where's my data?

GRG Hell.

OWO We have a hull breach
in zone four.

- Working on shields.
DET - Working on gravity systems.

OWO Commander, shields
aren't responding.

SAR Shield failure in zone four.

Any available crew respond.

TLY I'm in four. I'm gonna swap
the particle matrix and emitter,

and get the shields
back on line.

I just have
to keep my eyes closed.

SAR - What?
TLY - I've only done this once,

and I was blindfolded
for a drinking game.

SAR Ensign, we cannot depart
without shields.

TLY Yeah, I'm aware.

COMP Global gravity systems failure.

Global gravity systems failure.

CTRL LEL It doesn't have to be this hard.

GRG Not hard is boring,
and I hate boring.

COMP Gravity restored.

HLM COMP Third signal. Kaminar.

Stardate: 1035.86.

SIR You brought hope back with you.

You and your Red Angel.

ADM Damn it.

The matter/antimatter
intermix regulator

is still fully functional.

I can't disable it.

NUM Let's try reprogramming
the guidance system.

Maybe a conflicting command
will force it to shut down

until it acquires a new target.

ADM You're sure there's no way
to reprogram the blast door

- instead?
NUM - I wish there were.

Captain, plans A and B
didn't work.

We're now into the Hail Mary
part of the operation.

PKE That's been just about
everything today.

How much time do we have left?

NUM Less than five minutes.

PKE Report back to the bridge,
I'm giving you the Conn.

And, uh, Admiral,
do everything you can

to buy Burnham more time.

I'll be down in a moment.

ADM Wait.

NUM Admiral.

LRL And I thought my chancellorship
would be bloodless.
ASH Destroy those who would harm your chancellor!
LRL Tell the D-7 to target the drone fleet that attacks discovery. 
We will wade knee deep through the ruin of our enemies.

HLM COMP Fourth signal.

Boreth. Klingon territory.

Stardate: 1048.66.

PKE A new time crystal could let us
send the Sphere data

into the future after all.

HLM COMP Fifth signal. Xahea.

Stardate: 1050.8.

PKE And what might Xahea have to do
with powering the time crystal?

PO My dilithium incubator...
It'll replicate the power

of a supernova
and it'll charge your crystal.

SPK Michael?

BRN It's done.

My mom said she was trapped

950 years into the future
from Doctari Alpha.

That was 20 years ago.

Burnham to Discovery.
I'm setting coordinates

for the Beta Quadrant,
Terralysium,

930 years
from this launch point.

That should take us
where we need to go.

SAR Commander, the quantum
fluctuations within the wormhole

make it difficult to track your
position using standard sensors.

How do you intend
to guide us through?

BRN I'll send a signal.

The sixth signal. Like the
North Star, that's what this is.

You can follow it to me
on the other side.

SAR Copy, Commander.

PKE I'm approaching
the briefing room now.

NUM Copy that, Captain.

Standing by to assist.
PKE Thank you, Number One.

CTRL LEL Your algorithm was
the easiest to predict.

You would want fast access

to the ship's
two most valuable assets.

The data is in
the spore console.

You think this
cage will hold me?

PKE What if we transfer the
antimatter to antimatter pods?

ADM Too risky.

PKE You sure you can't reprogram
the guidance system?

ADM I've tried.

This thing is gonna blow
in 90 seconds.

There's an emergency lever
for the blast door.

I can bring it down manually,

from the inside,

and seal off
the rest of the ship.

PKE No.
ADM We are out of time.

That last light will change,
this torpedo will blow,

and everyone on the bridge,

maybe everyone on this ship,
will die.

PKE And if you do this, you die.

This is my ship,
my responsibility.

ADM This isn't where
your story ends.

And I think you know that.

PKE If I'm meant
for a different future,

this thing can't possibly go off
with me in here.

ADM Maybe not.

But how many people will pay
the price if you're wrong?

PKE Kat...

ADM Go. It's time.

And, Chris...

whatever your path may be,
you can handle it.

PART FOUR 

SAR Discovery to Enterprise,
are you all right?

PKE We're okay.

But we lost the admiral.

SAR Burnham, we are running
out of time.

BRN Okay, it's time to go, Spock.

Get back to Discovery.

SPK Michael,

I cannot.

BRN What?

SPK When my vessel was hit...

My engines are disabled.

BRN Discovery can lock onto you
with a tractor beam.

SPK There is no time.
And even if there were,

they would need to lower their
shields to bring me aboard,

and they will not survive
doing so. Not in this battle.

Not with the amount of damage
that ship has already sustained.

You must go.

BRN I just got you back.

I don't want to let go.

SPK Neither... do I.

BRN I already lost you once.

SPK You never lost me, Michael.

As a child,

I was truly lost.

The path of my father,

the path of my mother.

You came into our lives
and you taught me

it was possible to travel both.

You found me.

You saved me.

BRN That wasn't me.

That was always in you.

SPK You are my balance, Michael,

you always have been, and I...

am afraid

that I will not find it
again without you.

BRN Okay.

Listen to me.

Listen to me, little brother.

This is the last advice
I'll ever be able to give you.

There is a whole galaxy
out there

full of people
who will reach for you.

You have to let them.

Find that person who seems
farthest from you,

and reach for them.

Reach for them.

Let them guide you.

SPK I will.

I only wish I could be certain

of your safety.

BRN You will.

I'll send the last signal.

I'll send it
through the wormhole

when we get to the other side.

SPK I will watch the stars for it.

GRG Oh, enough with
the tantrum already.

Let's end this now, shall we?

You should know I've
magnetized the spore cube.

Enjoy.

SPK Spock to Enterprise.

My shuttle's engines
are disabled.

I will not be returning
to Discovery.

PKE Hold your position.
We'll transport you out.

Commander Saru,
how are your shields?

SAR Ensign Tilly, where are we?

TLY Almost there.

Somebody owes me a beer.

We are good to go, sir.

OWO Shields back up to 40%.

SAR More than enough, Captain.

PKE Stand by to transport, Spock.

SPK *Speaking Vulcan* I love you, Michael.

BRN I love you, too, brother.

PKE Commander Burnham, on your mark.

BRN Burnham to Discovery.
Let's go.

SAR Lieutenant Detmer, full power.
Follow our signal.

PKE All vessels,
aim at 3-mark-5-mark-2.

Clear a path.

SAR Goodbye, Captain Pike.

PKE Goodbye, my friends.

My family.

HUGH We're on our way, Paul.

We're on our way.

CTRL LEL This does not end here.

GRG Actually, it does,

and it's going to hurt.

And I'd like
to hear you scream now.

CTRL LEL No!

NUM Captain, they're all
dead in the water.

PKE Open fire.

GRG Georgiou to bridge.
I'm in Engineering.

Leland is dead.

Control is neutralized.

SAR Copy, Commander.

We are on our way.

PO Go.

Go, go.

(Dramatic flashbacks to everyones past together) 

STARFLEET DEBRIEFER State your name and rank.

ASH Ash Tyler, Acting Commander,
Section 31.

PKE Christopher Pike,
Captain of the USS Enterprise.

NUM Number One.
How long is this gonna take?

STARFLEET DEBRIEFER You were present
during the attack?

PKE I was. 
SPK I was.

NUM Discovery was Control's
primary target.

We were just in the way. 
STARFLEET DEBRIEFER When was that?

SPK I believe the exact date
is in the logs.

ASH Discovery was attempting
to escape while badly damaged.

PKE The spore drive must've suffered

a catastrophic failure
in battle.

It just went...

NUM Boom.

STARFLEET DEBRIEFER Seconds before Discovery's
disappearance,

our long-range sensors

detected high-energy gamma rays

and gravitational waves
consistent with a

quantum singularity.
How do you explain that?

SPK It is hardly my responsibility

to provide what your
own sensors could not.

- I saw Discovery explode.
ASH I saw Discovery explode.

PKE They're all gone.

STARFLEET DEBRIEFER That's your official response?

NUM For the third time, yeah.

Anything else?

STARFLEET DEBRIEFER Commander Michael Burnham,

do you think she...
ASH Do I think she what?

PKE Commander Burnham

went above and beyond
before her death.

Section 31, whether
by error or corruption,

took its eye off the ball

and is indirectly responsible
for this catastrophe.

STARFLEET DEBRIEFER We agree the
organization requires

a radical overhaul

and perhaps far
more transparency.

With the loss
of Admiral Cornwell

and Captain Georgiou,

we'd like to remove the "Acting"
from your title,

make it permanent.

ASH Wasn't so long ago,

I had to fight just to wear
a Starfleet uniform.

STARFLEET DEBRIEFER And that dedication,
coupled with a perspective,

Commander, it's safe to say
that your worldview

is uniquely suited

to the dualities
intrinsic to Section 31.

ASH Have you eliminated Control
entirely?

STARFLEET DEBRIEFER We have.

SPK The destruction
of Discovery was tragic

but does in and of itself
resolve the issue.

Even more radical steps
must be taken

to ensure that type of scenario
never repeats itself.

STARFLEET DEBRIEFER I'm eager to hear your
recommendations, Lieutenant.

SPK Regulation 157, Section Three,

requires Starfleet officers
to abstain

from participating
in historical events.

Any residual trace or knowledge
of Discovery’s data,

or the time suit,
offers a foothold

for those who might not see
how critical,

how deeply critical,
that directive is.

Therefore, to insure the
Federation never finds itself

facing the same danger,
all officers

remaining with knowledge
of these events must be

ordered never to speak
of Discovery, its spore drive,

or her crew again.

Under penalty of treason.

STARFLEET DEBRIEFER Thank you,
Mr. Spock.

We'll take it under advisement.

SPK Personal log.

Stardate: 1201.7.

124 days have passed

since your disappearance.

It has been difficult,

but we've managed
not to reveal the truth

of Discovery’s fate
to Starfleet.

To have done so was to risk

rendering your sacrifice
meaningless.

If we learned anything,

we learned we're not yet ready
to learn everything.

Mother and Father
are diplomatically immune

from interrogation,

and they fully understand
our silence

is meant to keep you safe.

We have sworn never
to speak your name

in the presence of others.

Yet I feel you with me, always.

With every moment, I grow
more sure-footed in this...

in-between place.

More certain
of who I am becoming.

You teach me, sister, even now.

Every night I look to the
stars for your signal,

and every night
I have to remind myself

of the scientific truth
that time is relative.

124 days for one

is the blink of an eye
for another.

It is difficult
to reconcile, logically.

But to paraphrase
an Earth physicist,

"The universe

is under no obligation
to make sense to me."

I believe that
you were successful.

I choose to believe it.

That is the only gift

I have left to give you.

It may not be logical, but I am

proud to bear it.

Mr. Spock to the bridge.

You've detected
an anomaly, Captain?

PKE Number One's running it now,

but, uh,

looks like it's
in the Beta Quadrant.

NUM That's correct, sir.

And we have confirmation.

The location
of the seventh signal.

51,000 light-years
from our present position.

I'll run the analytics.

PKE Where to, Number One?

NUM You're the captain,

Captain.

PKE I hear we discovered
a new moon at Edrin Two.

NUM That we did, sir.

PKE Thank you, Number One.

In that case,

let's give her a spin.

That sound good to you,
Mr. Spock?

SPK Yes, Captain.

Let us see
what the future holds.

NUM Ready for warp, sir.

PKE Hit it.

THE END
