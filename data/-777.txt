PART ONE

CAP: 
Stardate 57538.9.

CAP: The Cerritos is working
alongside the USS Merced

in the relocation
of an ancient generation ship,

which,
due to some unknown calamity,

never reached its destination.

Her crew, adrift for centuries,

mummified
in disabled cryo units.

CAP: Their most precious cargo...

Mysterious containers
of molecular fluid

which generates life
from inorganic material.

CAP: We suspect they planned
to use it on a dead planet


 


to create
a habitable environment

they could call home.

CAP: The Merced is here

To ensure the generation ship
is preserved

during transportation,

and I want everyone
to give them full support.

Captain Durango
and I both served

on the Illinois many years ago,

and it is a true delight to be

- able to work with him again.
MAR: - (Yawning)

CAP: Trouble sleeping, Ensign?

MAR: No, I slept great. I mean,
maybe too good, honestly.

CAP: Just distribute the PADDs.

DUR: Starfleet believes
this alien vessel


 


is equipped with unique
terraforming technology:

An elemental fluid
which can transform inert matter

into a living ecosystem.

Towing it will be
a delicate procedure.

Even the slightest flux in tractor beam

Stabilization could damage...

MAR: (yawning)

Oh. Oh, I am so sorry.
I'm sorry.

It is just so much
information.

I don't know
how you guys aren't yawning.

DUR: (scoffs) Your crew doesn't
appear to appreciate the gravity

of our undertaking, Captain.

CAP: I assure you, Captain,

my people are the best
in the fleet.

CAP: They're proficient, alert and...

MAR: - (yawning)
CAP: - (scoffs) Mariner!

MAR: I am trying to hold it in!

MARINER: Ugh!

I had to yawn, okay?
I'm sorry.

That guy is super boring.
Like, "Oh, I'm boring.

I love museums
and dust and old gates."

CAP: I know he's boring.
He's been boring for 15 years!

But right now, he's telling
everyone on the Merced

That I don't have the respect
of my crew.

If you ever
disrespect me like that again,

I'll skip the court-martial
and blow you out the airlock.

MAR: Cool.
Well, live long and prosper.

Don't you give me
that sarcastic Vulcan salute!

CAP: Beckett!

RAN: Captain, I have the sensor data
that you requested.

CAP: Huh? Oh, right. The sensors.

Ugh. I'm sorry, Jack.
It's just Ensign Mariner.

Ugh. I feel like
she stays up all night

Coming up with new ways
to piss me off.

RAN: I honestly don't know why you
haven't kicked her off the ship.

(clears throat)
But since it's not my job

to question your motives...

If you want to avoid
conflict,

why not reassign her
to all the worst jobs?

That way, transferring
would be her idea, not yours.

Hmm.

CAP: Well, we could reassign her

to all the nastiest jobs
on the ship.

That way, transferring her
would be her idea, not mine.

RAN: Brilliant plan.
That's why you're the captain.

BOIM: Assignment time!

Hatchi machi! (gasps)

BOIM: I got conference room
cleanup duty. In your face!

MAR: - Last time I checked, that was very lame.
BOIM: - (humming)

MAR: Why would you dance?
That's not a danceable job.

BOIM: That's where all the
senior officer action happens!

Plus, they have access to better
replicator programs than we do,

And sometimes
they let you eat with them!

MAR: It's, like,
basically the same food.

BOIM: No, it's not!

They get, like, gnocchi
and fritters and...

doesn't matter.
It's good, okay?

- (PADD chirping)
RUTH: - Oh, man. I got to monitor

power fluctuations
in the tractor beam?

I wanted to monitor
power fluctuations

in the impulse relays.

TEN: Rutherford! I'm about
to go watch an ascension.

RUTH: What? That's amazing!
What's an ascension?

TEN: Some people who master the art

of alien meditation
can achieve inner peace.

Then they transcend
the physical realm

and become a being
of pure energy.

- Isn't that cool?
RUTH: - Oh, like a Q or a the Traveler?

TEN: No! It's more like studying
so much for a test

that you literally
become the test.

(laughs)
You become everything!

RUTH: Damn, that is cool.

TEN: I can't believe I actually get
to see it in person!

TEN: I wonder
if it's gonna make a sound

like "vrr" or "hmm" or "whoo."

I guess I'll know soon!

MAR: Anyway, let's see
what I got assigned.

"Turbolift lubing,
holodeck waste removal

and scraping carbon
off the carbon filter"?

BOIM: Ooh. Those are the worst jobs
on the ship.

Scraping carbon off
of slightly harder carbon?

That's Klingon prison stuff.

MAR: This is weird.

(meditative humming)

(quietly)
TEN: Wow.

TEN: (laughing softly)
Wow.

Oh.

(meditative humming)
OCC:
As I grow closer
to decorporation,

words start to lose meaning.

(meditative humming)
TEN: 
Hey, are-are we supposed
to join in?

Hmm...

(gasps)
A tzutchian gong?!

(meditative humming)

(humming continues)
TEN:
- Oh.
- (sneezes) -MAN: What's happening?

- WOMAN: Is he ascending?
- MAN 2: I think he's ascending.

- WOMAN: He's ascending.
TEN: Really?! No, no, no, no!

- (grunts)
- (gong clangs)

OCC: - Aah!
- (gasps) My sand mandala!

TEN: - No, no, no, no!
- I can fix it! I can fix it!

OCC: I've been laying that
for two years!

It was a physical representation
of my inner calm!

TEN: No, no, it's gonna...
It's gonna be totally fine.

TEN: Just keep ascending! Computer,

colorful sand, room temperature.

Well, uh... there.

See? It's-it's... it's all good.

We're good. We're good.
It's fine. Uh...

PART TWO

MAR: If I had known I was going

to be emptying
the holodeck biofilters,

I wouldn't have had so much
for breakfast.

BOIM: Welp, have fun
with your terrible jobs.

I got to go clean
the executive conference room

and eat some lobster ravioli.
Peace.

MAR: Uh, no. Uh-uh. Sorry.

It does not look cool
when you do it.

Damn it, it does.

Ugh!
Hey, I'm working up here!

SHAXS:
Sorry.

(groaning)

(muttering)

MAR: Oh, this is the worst!
Oh, wait a minute.

Hey, buddy, do you want
to make this interesting?

CREWMAN: How? Like, bet on who can finish
their piece first?

MAR: - Yeah.
CREWMAN: - All right, sure. Why not?

CREWMAN 2: Yeah, I'll get in on that.

(cheering)

(laughs)
MAR: All right! Hell yeah!

RUTH: Syncing tractor beams
in three, two, one.

Whoa. I was wrong.
These fluctuations are great.

Aw, man,
look at these amplitudes!

(footsteps approaching)

TEN: Hi. Um, I just... I feel
terrible about the... you know.

OCC: Don't worry about it.
Don't talk to me.
TEN: 
Anyway, I went
and found a Hiverian metronome,

and apparently,
if you just relax

and let it sync
to your biorhythm,

we can get you back on track
and ascending by this afternoon!
OCC: 
You think I can realign a decade
of spiritual enlightenment

by this afternoon?!
TEN: 
Tomorrow morning at the latest.

You just have
to find your calm. Ah!
OCC:
I... don't... want...

your... help!
CAP: 
Has Mariner submitted
her transfer request?

(chuckles)
I'm going to frame it.
RAN: 
She's... having a great time.
CAP:
- What?!
RAN:
- She's finding little ways

to inject joy
into otherwise horrible tasks.
CAP: 
Then give her worse jobs.
RAN:
I've got her emptying (bleep)

out of the holodeck's
(bleep) filter!
CAP: 
Ugh.
People really use it for that?
RAN:
Oh, yeah, it's mostly that.
CAP:
Oh, if she finds a way
to enjoy that,

then what the hell are we gonna
do to get her to resign?
RAN:
I don't know,
but there has to be

something
on this ship she hates.
CAP:
Hmm...

Ensign Mariner,
report to Conference Room Five.
MAR:
Whoa-hoa,
another conference room meeting?

Shocker. You guys debating
the Prime Directive again?

Pretty fascinating stuff.

- (laughter)
- What is...?

No, no. No laughing.

I was making fun of you,
not with you.

CAP: Well, since you're one
of us now,

I guess you're making fun
of yourself.

MAR: What?

- (shudders): No.
CAP: - Ensign Beckett Mariner,

such disrespect and...

VASS:- Is she yawning?!

TEN: You know,
when O'Connor was screaming

and turning into energy,
it made me realize

that life's too short
to be hung up

on whether everyone
on the ship likes me.

RUTH: That's great, 'cause I'm sure
there's at least a few

- who don't.
- (both laugh)

TEN: And who cares? Not me.

So, who are these few people?
What did they say?

Do they not like me?
You know what? I don't care.

But if someone said something,
I feel like I should know.

Who was it?!

BOIM: (gasps)
Where's your pip?

MAR: Uh, I'm pretty good
at getting demoted.

BOIM: In the last hour?!

MAR: Uh, yeah. Apparently,
the captain doesn't like

looking stupid
in front of an admiral, so...

BOIM: What I... But I-I can't.

You-you had everything
that I ever wanted in life,

and you didn't even care!
How are we even friends?

MAR: Maybe because I still have
the senior officer access card

for the good
replicator programs.

BOIM: Oh! I'm gonna get that macaroni
and cheese with the breaded top!
