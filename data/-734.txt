PART ONE 

BRN Space.

The final frontier.

Above us.

Around us.

Within us.

We have always looked
to the stars

to discover who we are.

A thousand centuries ago
in Africa,

the Xam Abathwa tribe gathered to share a story.

The tale of a girl who dug
her hands in the wood ash

and threw it into the sky
to create

the Milky Way.

And hidden there,

a secret buried
among the eternal stars,

was a message.

An enormous letter in a bottle
made of space and time,

visible only to those
whose hearts were open enough

to receive it.

SRK A child has come to us.

AMD She's human.

SRK She is orphaned.

It is our responsibility.

AMD What happened to her parents?

SRK The unthinkable.

AMD My name is Amanda.

What's yours?

BRN Michael.

AMD I bless you, Michael.

All my life.

Do you want to meet our son?

BRN When I first heard the story

of the girl who made the stars,

I wasn't ready to understand.

I still don't know if I am.

SRK Spock.

Spock.

This is Michael Burnham.

She will be staying with us.

You will be teaching her
the ways of Vulcan.

I expect you to be friends.

BRN Hello.

SAR Ops, please tell
me what is wrong.

Does she need our assistance?

OWO Unable to comply, Captain.

Enterprise
is completely off-line.

BRN Except for life support.

Scans show
203 crew members aboard.

The vessel's
entire complement is alive.

BRY They're still sending
a priority one distress call,

but the signal's too compromised
for voice transmission.

TLY Morse code might get through!

Sorry. Sorry.
It's just there was static.

You know, then Comms
kind of turned it down.

But... I mean, obviously.

Sorry.

Hey, go, Comms.

Um, can Enterpriseswitch

to Morse code?

SAR Excellent suggestion, Ensign.

BRY Mr. Bryce, please try that.

STA a former colleague

is an ethnobotanist
on that ship.

I've seen its specs.

Only something catastrophic

could knock her out.

SAR Helm, do you detect

any escape pods or shuttles?

DET Negative, sir.

Damn, she's a beauty.

BRY Transmission coming through.
Captain Christopher Pike

requests permission
to come aboard.

He has an engineer
and science officer with him.

SAR Permission granted.

Commander Burnham,

you will join me
in welcoming them.

BRN Yes, sir.

SAR I had not expected
to see Spock again.

BRN Neither had I.

COM Attention, all.
Prepare for duty.

Please report
to your division duty officer.

Your brother is the science
officer on the Enterprise.

BRN Foster brother.

SAR I can sense your endocrine
system in overdrive.

You are
anxious to see him.

BRN I'm fine, Saru.

SAR Oh, I was using the term

in its most positive sense,
meaning "anticipatory."

BRN We received a priority alert

from one of Starfleet's
most prominent ships.

I am on mission
and in problem-solving mode.

That's what you're sensing.

SAR Hmm.

COM Order confirmed
Transport coordinates locked.

BRN Do you have any siblings?

SAR Oh, a sister.

Siranna.

Uh, I do not expect
a reunion with her.

Sadly, there is terrain
between us we cannot navigate.

BRN I know the feeling.

MALE Transporter locked status.
Energizing.

SAR Welcome aboard,

Captain Pike.

I am Commander Saru,

acting captain
of the USS Discovery.

How may we be of service?

PKE Well, Commander,
this is awkward,

but back in Mojave,
I learned the best way

to get into a cold stream
was to jump right in.

SAR Uh... yeah.
PKE Ah.

I'm here at Starfleet's order
to take command of the Discovery

under Regulation 19,
Section "C."

SAR Well, we received

no notice from Starfleet.

PKE Because I asked
to deliver the news myself

out of a respect for what you

and your crew have been through.

SAR Forgive me, Captain.

Your directive is
only instituted

under three contingencies:

when an imminent
threat is detected,

when the lives of Federation
citizens are in danger,

or when no other officers
of equal or higher rank

are present
to mitigate this threat.

May I ask under which
contingency you are here?

PKE All of them.

NAHN I see where the Federation
puts its pennies.

PKE Do not covet thy neighbor's
starship, Commander.

Besides, we've got
the new uniforms.

SAR And lovely uniforms
they are, Captain.

Very colorful.

PKE Over the past 24 hours,
Federation sensors picked up

seven red bursts spread out

across more than
30,000 light-years.

They appeared in
perfect synchronization

just long enough for
us to get a reading

and then, just as
suddenly, disappeared.

Except for one.

SAR Such precise synchronization
all but rules out

the chaos
of natural phenomena.

Are they some kind of signal?

PKE That's what we're calling
it, but I'll leave the rest

to my science officer.
Your ball, Connolly.

CONN The signals don't seem
to be moons, stars

or any other type of planetoid.

Truth is, we can't detect
anything about them

or engage with them in any way.

Every time we tried to scan,

the computer went haywire.

BRN Like a compass at
the North Pole.

PKE Well put.

Why didn't we think
of that, Connolly? Huh?

Think of all the syllables
that gave their lives.

CONN The metaphor seemed
a bit simplistic.

BRN I believe it's a simile.

PKE Then I owe you a
simile, Commander...?

BRN Burnham. Michael Burnham.

PKE He said you were smart.

We have someone in common.

BRN Yes, I'm aware.

PKE Mr. Spock.

BRN I was expecting to see him.

PKE Sometimes it's wise to keep
our expectations low, Commander.

That way
we're never disappointed.

PKE Excuse me.

LINUS Excuse me. Excuse me.

BRN Excuse me. Linus.

You okay? You look a little...

LINUS *CROAKS*

BRN Yes.

I hear it's going around.

SAR Perhaps the signals
are a temporal anomaly.

A tear in the fabric
of space-time.

Black holes can also cause
similar distortions.

CONN Not to this degree.

Six hours ago the signal
stabilized long enough

for us to get a fix
on its position.

PKE We were on our way to its
coordinates when suddenly, boom.

Enterprisesuffered multiple
catastrophic systems failures.

Starfleet is sending a team
to tow it to Spacedock

for a full diagnostic.

I'll kindly need
your command codes, Mr. Saru.

SAR I cannot do that.

PKE Pardon me?

SAR "Starship command shall
not be transferred

"without DNA authentication

witnessed by the
entire bridge crew."

It is standard operating
procedure since the war.

PKE O-Of course it is.
Yes, of course.

LINUS *SNEEZES*

CONN Bless you.

TLY Okay, Captain Pike.

Stand by for verification.

Um, I'm-I'm Ensign Sylvia Tilly.

I'm-I'm Discovery's
newest addition

to Starfleet's
Command Training Program.Hi.

Yeah, you have really
beautiful nail beds.

PKE Thank you.
TLY You're welcome.

Oh, I know what's wrong.
Uh, your pinkie is, um...

It's
just really weird

to say "pinkie"
to a captain.

It's not a very
authoritative finger,

but, um, you know,

it's not on the right pad.
Do- Can I...?
PIKE *GASPS*
Kidding.
TLY Oh, my God.

I thought I broke
a captain.

Sorry. I-I don't understand.

All the pertinent
information should be, uh...

There. Oh, God. I'm...

That's your file.
I'm sorry, sir. I...

PKE That's all right, Ensign.

Everybody, grab a seat.
Go ahead.

I want you all
to give that a read.

I'm Captain Christopher Pike.

Up there are my commendations,

my diagnosis
of childhood asthma.

Ah, he big red "F,"

that was my failing grade in
astrophysics at the Academy.

I know this is a hard left turn.

You were en route to Vulcan
to pick up a new captain.

I was briefed on
the classified details

surrounding your last one.

I know he betrayed this crew.

If I were you, I'd have my
doubts about me as well.

But I'm not him.

I'm not Lorca.

The Federation's hackles are up.

I don't have to remind you that
the last time we investigated

a previously unknown
energy distortion,

it resulted in the Klingon war.

These mysterious signals

are unlike anything
we've encountered.

The energy needed
to create them

is beyond anything
we understand.

Is it a greeting?

A declaration of malice?

That's why they put me
on the Discovery

when the Enterprisewent down;

nobody wanted to wait
to find out.

But right now,
this little dot

is the only one willing
to tell us where it is.

Helm, plug in the coordinates.

Let's pay a visit.

Warp factor five.

DET Aye, sir.

PKE With your permission,
Commander Saru.

SAR The ship is yours, Captain.

PKE All right, then.

Hit it.

PART TWO 

CUL HOLO Do you hear that?

I sent you my favorite aria
so that you would reconsider

your wildly lame position
on Kasseelian opera.

And to add insult to injury,
I got us actual tickets.

I know. I know you
say you hate it,

and that you only
do it for me, but...

I do love it when you
only do things for me.

I love it.

All right.
I'll see you later.

TLY Commander?

Commander Stamets?

Oh, sorry to interrupt.

Um, given our new mission,

I've been assigned
as Command Program Trainee

to manage the reallocation
of the ship's resources.

The spore drive...
STA I finally understand

why Hugh was so enamored
with Kasseelian opera.

TLY Oh.

STA The tonal matrices
woven together...

the weird rapture between
instruments and voice...

Hugh said
it would reach me.

And he was right... as usual.

TLY Um, so since the spore drive
is inactive, um,

the-the, uh, the engine room
is, um, being converted

back into a standard, uh,
engineering workspace

until Disco's up
and jumping again.

Um, I did notice
that they neglected

to assign you a new lab.

But then I remembered
Brianna in Logic Sciences

has two stories on the third
level, and then it hits me,

"Why does she need
all that space?"

Logic science is
basically meditation.

I mean, I've never
seen the woman move.

So I put her in a utility closet
on 12 and I put you in there.

I'm drunk on power.

STA Thanks, Tilly,
but it isn't necessary.

TLY Well, what do you want me to do
with your equipment?

STA Just put it in storage.

TLY No, really.

STA After the peace accord in Paris,

the Vulcan Science Academy
offered me

a permanent teaching position.

I said yes.

TLY W-Wh- You're gonna stay
on Vulcan?

But what about the, uh,
network?

You have it by the tail.

You have so much more
to accomplish.

STA Did you know that
a Kasseelian prima donna

trains her whole life
for one performance?

And after she hits
that last high "E,"

she plunges a dagger
into her own chest and dies?

She's lived an entire
lifetime in that last note.

And I've lived
an entire lifetime

in what I've accomplished here,
on Discovery.

TLY But what about...?

STA Hugh is everywhere I look,
Tilly.

How much am I supposed to take?

Starfleet approved
my transfer.

It's been postponed until the
completion of Pike's mission.

TLY Sir, I just have
to tell you that, um,

I understand that this place
may be haunted for you,

but maybe it's good haunted,

maybe living with ghosts
and energies that are bigger

than we are is why
you love science.

STA Tilly. You are...

...incandescent.

You're going to become
a magnificent captain

because you do
everything out of love.

But...

I need you to repeat after me.

TLY Okay.

STA "I will say..."
TLY I will say...

STA "... fewer things."

TLY ...fewer thing- Okay.

I don't want you to go.

AMD "'Would you tell me, please,

"which way I ought to go
from here?'

"'That depends a good deal on
where you want to get to,'

"said the Cat.

"'I don't care much where,'
said Alice.

"'Then it doesn't matter

which way you go,'
said the Cat."

Which way do you want to go?

BRN Home. To Earth.

AMD I'm gonna take you there
someday, sweetheart.

BRN Door.

SAR May I enter?

BRN Yes, of course.

SAR It would appear the human
proverb is accurate:

old habits die hard.

BRN Or they never die at all.

I wasn't aware you knew
Amanda read Alice to me.

SAR While I was often occupied
by work in the evenings,

it did not prevent my listening
from upstairs.

Her voice gave comfort
to us both.

I will be leaving Discovery

as soon as we drop out of warp.

Vulcan High Command has asked
that I work with Starfleet

in assembling
a Federation task force.

These signals
must be deciphered,

and the timing must be
considered, so soon after a war.

BRN Do you think they're related?

Could the Klingons be involved?

SAR No.

I reached out to
High Chancellor L'Rell.

The Klingons have seen
the signals, too,

and they have no explanation
for them, either.

BRN Why do you think
he didn't come on board?

SAR Undoubtedly, Spock
has devoted himself

to brining the
Enterpriseback on line.

BRN There's more to it than that.

How long has it been
since you spoke to him?

SAR Years.

BRN Me, too.

When I first came to you,

I-I know that you considered
every possible effect

a Vulcan education,
a Vulcan life,

might have on a human child.

What did you want Spock
to learn from me?

SAR Empathy.

Something he would need
to understand

to successfully interact
with humans.

BRN Wouldn't he have learned this
from our mother?

SAR Spock has great reverence
for his mother.

But reverence tends to...

Fill up the room.

Indeed.

BRN So from a peer,

a sibling, you thought...

SAR Yes.

But I do not think
I was successful.

I do not think he ever
fully accepted you.

BRN He may have.

For a time.

SAR Just a time?

I'm discouraged he did not
embrace the lesson.

BRN Father, I am confident that
empathy is very real for Spock.

SAR I can hear the
missing notes, Michael.

There is something
about your relationship

you're not sharing.

It weighs on you.

Despite my departure,

I will avail myself to you,

should you choose to
speak of it someday.

BRN Thank you.

SAR In the meantime,
I suggest you focus

on the problem in front of you,
rather than what is behind.

DET We're approaching the signal's
coordinates, Captain.

PKE Acknowledged.

Bridge crew,
give me a roll call.

Lord knows what's waiting
for us down there.

I want to know who
I'm facing it with. Sound off.

And skip your ranks,
they don't matter.

Clockwise from Science.

BRN Michael Burnham.

CONN Evan Connolly.

GEN Gen Rhys.

DET Keyla Detmer.

OWO Joann Owosekun.

ARIM Lieutenant Commander Airiam.

BRY Ronald Altman Bryce.

SAR Saru.

Just Saru.

PKE All right.
Rhys, charge phaser cannons.

Bryce, start transmitting
standard Federation greeting.

Owosekun, Saru, Connolly,
Burnham, scan what you can.

Detmer... fly good.

DET Aye, Captain.

PKE Yellow Alert.
Drop us out of warp.

OWO I'm detecting something.

PKE How close was that? 
SAR 700 meters.

PKE I was expecting a red thing.
Where's my damn red thing?

BRN All sensors are
at maximum power.

There's no sign
of the original signal

or any object that might
have generated it.

SAR As if it were a mirage.

PKE All right, let's ID
what nearly T-boned us.

See if it can provide
any answers.
SAR It appears to be an
interstellar asteroid

traveling at 5,000
kilometers per second.

BRN Sir, the point
of near impact

was the exact coordinates
of the signal.

PKE Well, that's interesting.
Chase it, Detmer.

DET Chasing, sir.
PKE What do the scans tell us?

BRN There's interference from
a hyper-dense cloud

of charged particles.

This rock has an atmosphere.

CONN How? It isn't large enough
to generate

a sufficient gravity field.

DET Not so sure about that.

We just splashed into
a deep gravity well

that appears to be
rapidly fluctuating.

PKE Okay. I want to know
what's down there.

Suggestion. 
BRN Discovery has
telescopic cameras

to help aid in hull repairs.

We point them at the asteroid
and capture images.
PKE Love it. Do it.

BRN Images are coming in,
but closer is better.

PKE Increase to one-quarter impulse.
DET Accelerating one-quarter, sir.

SAR Report!
DET We just pushed apart

like two similarly charged
magnets.

I've never experienced
anything like it.

SAR Our interaction has changed
the object's trajectory.

It is now on a collision course
with a pulsar.

Time to incineration:
five hours.

BRN There's a Starfleet vessel
down there.

PKE On screen.

BRN I picked up a strange chasm
cutting across

the ice field of
the asteroid's surface.

They crash-landed.

PKE Hail them, Bryce.

BRY Absolutely no response, Captain.

BRN There's no way to zoom in
any further.

PKE Commander Saru,

I know your vision has a larger
optical window than ours.

Can you make out
the registry number?

SAR N-C-C dash 8-1-5.

A medical frigate.

OWO Running it.

The USS Hiawatha,

thought destroyed
by the Klingons ten months ago.

PKE Any life signs?

CONN Still impossible
to scan, sir.

The asteroid's temperature is
negative 120 degrees Celsius.

PKE Helm, stay on their tail.

Prep a landing party.

Is there any location on that
asteroid that we can beam to?

BRN Negative. The cloud
of charged particles

will disrupt transporter
signals.

Without pattern enhancers,

transport to and from
the asteroid is too dangerous.

PKE A shuttle?

RHYS: The unpredictable
gravity fields

would make landing impossible,
sir.

SAR If there's anybody down there,

I'm not leaving them there
to die.

PKE It is my duty to articulate
that the odds of survival

in a crashed ship on one of
the most hostile environments

in space are unlikely,

and risking more crew
to confirm that fact,

well, it requires consideration.

I'm considering
that if you're wrong,

we've got less than five hours
to get them out.

BRN Landing on an asteroid traveling

at 5,000 kilometers per second

with spotty telemetry
and no transporter...

PKE I know what it is, Commander.

I didn't sit out the war with
my crew just to stand down now.

Listen, I don't mind dissenting
opinions, I really don't,

but they have
to come with solutions.

BRN Yes. I have one.

That's what I was trying
to offer.

And for the record,

there is not a single person
on this bridge who would abandon

a Starfleet brother
or sister... sir.

PKE Right there with you.

What did you have in mind?

BRN We have less than two hours
to fly down

to the asteroid's surface
and search for survivors,

then set up pattern enhancers
and beam back.

CONN Unless our signals get caught up
in all that E.M. distortion

and we rematerialize
in a billion pieces.

PKE You want out, Connolly?
Now's the time.

CONN Not a chance, sir.
I love roller coasters.

PKE What about you, Burnham?
BRN I'm not uncomfortable with risk.

PKE Get your red shirt into a EV
suit, Nhan. You're with us.

NAHN Can't wait, sir.

PART THREE 

TLY Hey, I need a sample
of that asteroid.

I was down in engineering
during the flyby, right?

I noticed that all the spores
started going crazy

the closer we got.

It-it may be a coincidence,

but I haven't seen a
mycelial energy spike

like this since the Tardigrade.

BRN Stamets must be
having a field day.

TLY Um... Stamets is transferring
off the ship.

And if you ask me
any more questions,

I'm gonna start crying like
a baby Tribble in the kill zone.

Promise you'll be coming back,

'cause I can't lose
two people in one day.

That's right. You can't
promise that. Um, lie to me?

BRN I'm coming back, Tilly.

COMP All non-essential personnel,

please clear
main shuttle bay immediately.

COM Landing pod one,

stand by for launch prep.

Landing pod four,
stand by for launch prep.

Landing pod two,
five minute check complete.

Landing pod pilots,
you are clear to board.

SAR Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

OWO Launch stations
one through four engaged.

BRN Pod Control, stand by
to commence launch initiation.

COMP Auto navigation system on line.

BRN These lander pods were developed
for a mission to Kim-Tara.

It has similar
gravimetric conditions.

PKE You've flown 'em before,
Burnham?
BRN Yes, sir.

I was one of the test pilots.
Nine Gs for 11 minutes.

CONN Maintaining for 11 minutes seems
like a bit of a stretch.

BRN For some of us, maybe.

PKE Okay, guys.

DET launch sequence confirm.

Thrusters ready on my mark.

Launch in five...

four... three... two...

one.

COMP Auto navigation confirmed.

OWO I don't like those thermals.

DET The rock's under
so much pressure

that when the gravity
field fluctuates,

the debris inflates.
OWO You mean explodes?

SAR Really? Are you surprised?

BRN I'm not detecting any pattern to
these energy field detonations.

NAHN Magnetics are messing
with my nav computer.

PKE I'm peaking, too.
Switch to manual navigation.

NAHN I'm losing control.

BRN These pods are built
for this, Nhan.

Just take the stick manually.

NAHN You mean manually manually?

BRN Connolly,
your field is too wide.

Watch the boulders
in lateral grid six.

CONN Ooh!

BRN Connolly, I'm telling you

your field is too wide!

PKE Pull back, Lieutenant.
That's an order!

CONN Sir, she didn't alter
the computer's flight patterns

to adjust for the gravitational
fluctuations. I've got this.

BRN You can't rely on sensors!

CONN Don't question my calculations.

My roommate at the academy
was part Caitian.

And she was a year ahead of me,
Burnham, but I told her

what I'll tell you-
just relax and let me do...

BRN No!

PKE Connolly?!

OWO Pod three is down.

DET Pod two has sustained
structural damage.

Navigation is off-line.

COMP Structural integrity
compromised.

System failure is imminent.

PKE Initiating ejection sequence.

COMP Warning:
Exo-suit initiation failure.

Auto eject override.

Discovery,
I have system-wide failure.

Negative on evac.
I am in total free fall.

SAR Captain Pike,

we are running a remote
diagnostic on your pod now.

PKE It's dead. That's the diagnosis.

No. My thruster pack's damaged.
The damn helmet's stuck.

BRN Discovery,can you activate the
captain's ejector seat remotely?

DET Lot of surface distortion.
I need another 30 seconds.

OWO Without EV boosters,
he'll still be in free fall.

BRN Not if I can catch him.

PKE Forget it, Burnham. I already
lost one officer today.

BRN I'm comfortable
with the risk, sir.

PKE And I'm not. If you screw
this up, we're both dead.

Stay on mission.
That's an order.

DET 2,000 feet till impact.

BRN You need to trust us, sir.
I told you

we don't abandon each other.

Discovery has you.

We have him, right, ladies?

OWO Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

PKE Do it.

BRN Calculating the burn rate
to stop terminal velocity.

Once I eject, take control
of my thruster and plot

a trajectory to the captain.
DET Working on it.

OWO 20 seconds to impact!

BRN Nhan, stay on course
to the asteroid's surface.

You'll be fine.
I'm going after the captain.

DET Copy that.
Go get 'em, Burnham.

OWO I have a lock.
DET Plotting your
trajectory, Burnham.
If this works, you have less
than ten seconds to catch him,

and then
I'll hit your thrusters.

BRN Copy. Get ready
to eject the captain on my mark.

On three.

One.

Two.

Three.

OWO Six seconds to impact.

Five. Four.

Three.

Two. One.

DET Initiating maximum thrust!

SAR Burnham?

Burnham, do you copy?

BRN Discovery, this is Burnham.
We have touchdown.

There's a ton of interference.

Tilly was right.

The asteroid's energy density
is off the charts.

We need to get her a sample
for analysis.

PKE My God.

COMP Red alert. Red...

Perimeter red alert.

Collision imminent.

PKE Man, they came down hard.

BRN Titanium. Snapped in half.

The gravitational field
was probably

ten times stronger
when they landed.

I have an incoming target.

It's made from scavenged
Starfleet tech.

NAHN I see navigation parts.

PKE Looks like
multi-vector propulsions.

BRN Inertial dampeners, too.
This design is...

JET Awesome. I know. I built them.

You're welcome.

Don't just stand there.
Follow the kids. Come on!

BRN Are we breathable here?

JET Yup. Ditch your helmets,
and keep her coming.

Stop! Look down.

I don't have time
for you to get decapitated.

Oh, thank Christ
you guys are here.

I'm Commander Jett Reno,
Engineering.

I'd shake your hand, but

I'm up to my elbow
in Tellarite brains.

PKE Captain Christopher Pike
of the USS Discovery.

This is Commander Burnham
and Commander Nhan.

JET Yeah. I saw the
Federation insignia.

It's why I didn't
vaporize you.

PKE Who were you expecting?

JET Are you kidding? Maybe
someone with a bat'leth?

Never need to see
another one of those

for the rest of my damn life.

Ugh. Grek's head wound keeps
opening up, poor guy.

Nice to meet ya.

Relax. Tellarite blood's rich
in hemerythrin.

The only place on Earth
you'll find anything

like it is marine
invertebrates.

Evolution's a fickle
bitch, am I right?

BRN How long have you...?
JET Ten months, 11 days.

Remind me never to get stranded

in enemy space
with a war raging.

PKE Commander Reno, the war's over.

JET No one's speaking Klingon,
so... we won?

BRN There was an armistice.
We're at peace.

JET An armistice with the guys
who drink bloodwine?

BRN Yes.

JET Hear that, Valentine?

The war's over.
We're going home.

Valentine took
a piece of shrapnel

to the left aortic valve.

Needed a transplant, but didn't
have a donor, so I piggybacked

his heart to a dead Bolian
to keep it ticking.

NAHN You're an engineer,
not a surgeon.

JET Body's just a machine,
and I read.

BRN Commander, you kept all of these
officers alive by yourself?

JET The kids helped. I built them
to handle a lot of weight.

When I suspended
the counterweights,

they hung me upside down
like a bat.

PKE When were you shot down?

JET On the way to Starbase 36.

We got most of the war-wounded
into escape pods,

but this batch was too critical
to move.

PKE And you stayed behind?
JET Of course I stayed behind. What
the hell would you have done?

Admittedly,
not the brightest move.

We've been rocking
and rolling for hours.

Can someone tell me
what's going on?

BRN This asteroid is

on a collision course
with a pulsar.

The gravitational field is
gonna tear this place apart.

JET Uh. What a relief.
Thought we were all gonna die.

Can you get us
the hell out of here, or what?

BRN We're damn sure gonna try.

The pads are still intact.

Can we move your patients?
JET Dicey, but yeah.

BRN Ready.

Set up the enhancers
around the ship-

widest perimeter possible-
then meet us at sickbay.

JET Got it.

BRN We're in business.

JET Why are we moving them if you're
creating an enhancement field

big enough to beam
from anywhere on the ship?

BRN The enhancers are
just a backup in case

the Hiawatha'smain transporter
doesn't stay on line.

Ship-to-ship beaming on the pads
is far more reliable, and it'll

be safer for your patients.
See if you can get that one up.

JET Where the hell were you
ten months ago?

PKE Commander, do you know anything
about the signal?

JET What signal?

PKE Well, we found you by tracking
the coordinates of a signal,

one of seven.

Turned up
straight out of nowhere.

JET I don't know anything about it.

BRN Once the perimeter's set,

we can start beaming them out
six at a time.

NAHN Enhancement field is on line!

PKE Let's go! Let's go!

OWO We have transporter signal, sir.

DET Proximity alert, sir.

The debris is getting worse.

SAR If the transporters are up,
then we have no shields.

Yellow alert! Evasive maneuvers!

DET Starboard impact!

SAR That asteroid will not hold
together much longer.

Comms, notify Dr. Pollard
and have her team ready

to receive survivors
in the transporter room.

JET Come on, come on, come on.

Yes.

The first wave of patients
are aboard, Captain.

SAR Keep us in transporter range.

PKE Pike to Discovery. Standing
by for final transport.

BRN Rerouting power.

PKE Burnham, let's go.

Burnha-

BRN Discovery,if you can hear me,

track my signal.

Helmet!

PART FOUR 

PKE Are you all right?

BRN Yeah.

PKE Pike to Discovery.
Get us out of here.

BRN Wait!

TLY Oh. Excuse me.

Excuse me. S-Sorry.

Are you okay?

BRN Femoral shaft fracture.
Dr. Pollard said I'd be up

on my feet in two hours.

TLY It's okay if you forgot
the sample. I-

The only thing I care
about coming back is you.

BRN Tilly, I-I had it, in my hand.

TLY But when I beamed out, the
transporter didn't get a lock.

Then that would mean
that the asteroid

is not entirely comprised
of baryonic matter.
BRN Right.

Could mean that Discovery is...
touching something

impossible. Yeah.
TLY Impossible.

A-a bridge to a
potentially unlimited

and-and 100%-efficient
energy source.

A new branch of science
could be sprouting before us,

and we are its founding mothers.

It would explain the volatile
gravitational energy.

BRN I-I need to...Get that sample

before it's swallowed up by
that pulsar. Now, the asteroid

has been shedding rocks
all over the place.

I mapped several
of their trajectories.

We still have time
to reach one of them.

TLY This is what you've been doing
since you were rescued?

You're supposed
to be recovering.

BRN I'm a terrible patient.

TLY I second that.

BRN 67 minutes until
vaporization.

Go.

TLY Tilly to Engineering.

Get me a gravity simulator

and meet me
in the shuttle bay now.

The bridge is standing by
and ready to receive.

ARIM Is there a flux coupler
in the crate?

We need it to activate
the power relays.

STA Something like this?

TLY What are you
doing here?
STA Well, that depends.

Are you attempting to capture
an asteroid, Ensign Tilly?

TLY Uh, just a little piece.
If my theory's correct,

we'll be able to interact
with dark matter, sir.

STA Well, I'm offended I
wasn't invited to the party.

TLY Oh, my- oh my, God,
you're so invited.

CREWMAN Everybody clear!

COM Gravity simulator
is on line, Captain.

PKE Copy that, Ensign.
We'll get into position.

Mr. Saru.

My mission has ended.

I believe this one's yours.

SAR Thank you, Captain.

Lieutenant Detmer,
engage your intercept course

and place the asteroid
directly in our wake.

DET It'd be my pleasure, sir.

This feels bad.

PKE Hold tight.
OWO Aft shields at 110% of maximum.

90 seconds
until they overload.

PKE Detmer, pump the brakes.

DET It's in the bay.

All systems intact.

Good to go, Commander.

SAR Helm, get us out of here.

Shuttle bay, what's your status?

STA I thought it'd be bigger.Mm.

TLY The shuttle bay needs a little
TLC, but all is well, Commander.

This is the power
of math, people!

Come on!
STA You are correct, Ensign.

PKE Come in.

Ah.

All better? Can't have
my science officer

walking around looking
like that tower in Pisa.

BRN Dr. Pollard is the definition
of "meticulous."

PKE Mm.

BRN I heard you were staying on
with us.

PKE Oh. Yeah.

The damage to Enterprise
was severe.

Engineering Corps has no idea
when she'll be back on line.

BRN Does Commander Saru know?

PKE Yes.

And we'll treat this like a...

joint custody situation.

He's got a lot
of smart.

And since the Federation
has entrusted Discovery

with determining the source
and intent of those signals,

I need all the smart I can get.

And I need a new
ready room.

Where the hell
do people sit, huh?

BRN They don't.

Lorca wasn't one
to encourage discourse.

PKE Well,

I want my officers
to feel like they can

pull up a chair
and speak freely.

Why don't we get the hell out
of here, huh?

Come on.

BRN Yes, sir.

Has Spock told you why he and
I don't have a relationship?

PKE No.

Not specifically.

BRN I'm the reason.

I'd like to go
to Enterprise, sir.

To see him.

PKE I'm sorry, Burnham,
but Spock's not there.

He took leave.

Missing the war...

while the Enterprise
was on its five-year mission,

that, uh...

took a toll on my crew,

a toll on Spock.

On me, too.

BRN Even if they had
called you back,

you were so far away, you
wouldn't have made it in time.

Starfleet ordered you
to stay away for a reason.

Enterprise was an instrument
of last resort.

PKE "What is the logic
in staying away

if there is nothing left
to come back to?"

Spock asked the most
amazing questions.

It's completely logical

yet somehow able to make
everyone see that logic

was the beginning of the
picture and not the end.

He was ahead of all
of us, in that way.

A few months ago,

I... I felt something
shift in him.

It was as if he'd run into
a question he couldn't answer.

He-he didn't want
to share it with me.

With anybody.

BRN And you have no idea
what it might have been?

PKE No. Spock's one
of my bridge officers.

I trust him implicitly.

He asked me for time,
and I gave it to him.

BRN How long will he be gone?

PKE Not sure.

He had months and months
accumulated.

BRN I'd still like to go aboard.

I don't know
what I expect to find,

but...

I need to.

SARUS VOICE Captain Pike to the bridge.

PKE You should go.

And, Burnham...

...wherever our mission
takes us,

we'll try to have a little fun
along the way, too, huh?

Make a little noise.

Ruffle a few feathers.

BRN I look forward to it, Captain.

SPK Personal log.

As a child, I had what my mother
called nightmares.

She taught me to control my fear
by drawing it,

rendering fear powerless.

The nightmares have returned.

The same vision,
again and again.

I now understand its meaning

and where it must lead me.

In the event of my death,

I have encoded it
within this audio file.

This may be my last entry
aboard the Enterprise.

BRN There are so many
things I wish I'd said to you,

so many things
I want to say now.

I'm too late, aren't I?

Oh, Spock.

I can only pray
I don't lose you again.

Brother.
