PART ONE 
RAFFI They give you a hard time? They start with the ships?
PICARD Straight out, just as you predicted.
RAFFI You were ready, with the inventories from Beta Antares and Eridani A, which shut them up.
RAFFI So they hit you with manpower.
PICARD Mm-hmm.
RAFFI But you had the reserve rosters I got from Tanaka in personnel.
PICARD I laid it all out.
PICARD By using reserve duty officers and mothballed ships, we could maintain the evacuation, though to a severely reduced level.
RAFFI Not if we use synthetic labor.
PICARD All synthetic life-forms are banned, throughout the Federation, effective immediately.
PICARD All active units are dismantled and all research is halted.
RAFFI Well, that's crazy.
RAFFI It makes no sense.
RAFFI Synths don't just wake up one morning and turn homicidal.
PICARD They said it was a fatal code error in the operating system.
RAFFI That's bullshit.
RAFFI S... Something's off about this whole business, JL.
RAFFI It doesn't add up.
RAFFI I smell the Tal Shiar.
PICARD Tal Shiar.
PICARD Raffi, why would the Romulans attack a fleet built expressly to rescue them?
RAFFI I can't answer that.
RAFFI Yet.
RAFFI But I do know that there are billions of people out there in the Beta Quadrant that are in the burst radius of a supernova.
RAFFI It's not their fault that a bunch of A500s went rogue on Mars.
PICARD You're absolutely right.
PICARD Mars is burning.
PICARD Tens of thousands are dead.
PICARD And nobody is thinking, nobody is listening.
PICARD They're just reacting.
RAFFI Wait a minute.
RAFFI What happened in there, JL?
PICARD They said that our plan was "unfeasible."
PICARD Half of them never wanted to rescue the Romulans in the first place.
PICARD And the rest are... are just... frightened.
PICARD I never dreamed that Starfleet would give in to intolerance and fear.
RAFFI What happened in there?
PICARD I said that either they accept the revised evacuation plan... or my resignation.
RAFFI Are you serious?
RAFFI Well... what did they say?
RAFFI Jean-Luc?
PICARD They accepted my resignation.
RAFFI I...
RAFFI Hell with them.
RAFFI We'll figure it out.
RAFFI We'll find a way.
PICARD To mount a multi-world evacuation of tens of millions of Romulans without Starfleet's support?
RAFFI There has to be something.
RAFFI Some last, desperate, wild solution, JL.
RAFFI That's what you do.
PICARD My resignation was the last, desperate, wild solution.
PICARD I never believed that they would... accept it.
RAFFI Of course you wouldn't.
RAFFI Now what?
RAFFI You're gonna go back to your château and write your memoirs?
RAFFI I can't do this without you, JL.
RAFFI Oh.
RAFFI The CNC wants to see me.
RAFFI That's great.
RAFFI That's great.
RAFFI You tender your resignation, and my ass gets fired.
PICARD Raffi?
RAFFI A synthetic girl.
PICARD There were two of them.
PICARD One of them is already dead.
PICARD I only hope that I'm in time to save the other one.
PICARD Raffi, I need a ship and a pilot, and I have to find Bruce Maddox.
RAFFI Wow.
RAFFI I don't even know what to say.
PICARD Yeah. It's a lot to take in.
RAFFI I mean, the obvious way to go would be, "You have some goddamn nerve."
RAFFI But I gather you... you already heard that from your buddy Clancy, right?
RAFFI Pro tip for future reference.
RAFFI On your next top-secret, unauthorized, synthetic girl rescue mission, try not telling the CNC of Starfleet exactly what you're planning on doing.
PICARD I don't remember you being such a chatterbox back in the day.
RAFFI I mean...
RAFFI I saw your interview.
PICARD An unmitigated disaster.
RAFFI Yeah.
RAFFI I saw you, sitting back in your very fine château.
RAFFI Those big oak beams, heirloom furniture.
RAFFI Yeah, I-I'd show you around my estate, but it's more of a hovel, so that would just be, you know, humiliating.
RAFFI But my entire life for the past 14 years has been one long slide into humiliation.
RAFFI And rage.
RAFFI Also a fair amount of snakeleaf-induced paranoia, so... some things never change.
RAFFI Mmm. Hmm.
RAFFI Might have been nice to hear from you a time or two in there, JL, not because you think I know an off-the-books pilot with an unregistered starship.
RAFFI Just...
RAFFI ...to say hi.
RAFFI See how I was doing.
PICARD I know. I...
RAFFI Because I was not doing good.
RAFFI I lost my security clearance.
RAFFI I lost...
PICARD Don't, Raffi.
RAFFI No, don't. Just don't touch me.
PICARD Raffi.
PICARD Raffi.
SOJI'S VOICE You are free now, my friend.
HUGH I really don't know what to say, Dr. Asha.
HUGH Your work here has always been excellent, but speaking to a Nameless in his own language?
HUGH Outstanding.
SOJI You taught me that even a few words in the mother tongue can be soothing.
SOJI Even in an unconscious state.
HUGH There is no more despised people in the galaxy than the xBs.
HUGH People either see us as property to be exploited or as a hazard to be warehoused.
HUGH Our hosts, the Romulans, have a more expansive vision.
HUGH They see us as both.
SOJI I hate it.
HUGH You're different.
SOJI Thank you.
HUGH I've decided to let you have your interview with Ramdha.
SOJI Oh, my God, really?
HUGH You've been pestering me about it for a long time.
HUGH After today, I'm inclined to grant your request.
HUGH Tell me, why?
SOJI How much do you know about Ramdha before she was assimilated?
SOJI Have you read her Romulan dossier?
HUGH Of course not.
HUGH Wait, have you?
HUGH How did you manage that?
SOJI I just sort of asked to see it.
SOJI Usually I find that if I ask people for help, they're happy to give it.
HUGH That has not been my experience. In particular with Romulans.
SOJI Ramdha was the foremost expert on ancient Romulan myth.
SOJI She wrote books about it.
HUGH And this interest of hers links you to her work how?
SOJI There is ample evidence for the therapeutic utility of a shared mythical framework.
HUGH 30 minutes.
HUGH As an experiment.
HUGH Then we'll see how that goes.
PART ONE 
PICARD It makes total sense that you're angry.
PICARD I disappointed you. I neglected you.
PICARD And I wasn't there when you needed me.
PICARD I'm truly sorry.
RAFFI I don't care.
PICARD Raffi, there is a unit of Tal Shiar synth hunters operating on Earth, openly.
PICARD That could not happen without Federation complicity.
RAFFI I'm listening.
PICARD You always said there were Romulan-Federation connections I didn't see.
RAFFI I was talking about Mars, JL.
RAFFI The Romulan rescue.
RAFFI Those aren't connections I just see, like people see angels or-or, uh, ghosts.
RAFFI I have evidence.
RAFFI I have concrete evidence that a high-ranking Starfleet official conspired to allow the attack to go forward, to put an end to the rescue mission.
PICARD Raffi...
RAFFI Which they opposed.
PICARD Raffi, they had no reason to sabotage their own rescue.
RAFFI What do you think happens when there's a cover-up?
RAFFI They conceal it.
PICARD That's why I need your help.
PICARD I need your mind.
PICARD Your ability to see things others don't see.
RAFFI No. No, no, no, no.
RAFFI I will not go down another rabbit hole with you, JL.
RAFFI No, never again... No. Go.
PICARD Raffi...
RAFFI Get out of here, please.
RAFFI Please.
RAFFI I have a pilot for you.
RAFFI His name is Rios.
RAFFI And he'll be in touch.
PICARD Rios. Thank you.
RAFFI Now go.
JURATI Hi.
COMMODORE OH Dr. Jurati?
COMMODORE OH Commodore Oh, director of Starfleet Security.
JURATI Okay.
COMMODORE OH I'd like to talk to you about your two recent visits with Admiral Picard.
COMPUTERAFFI All personnel...
HUGH She's here to meet with Patient 4822 stroke 2.
ROMULAN GUARD She'll need authorization.
HUGH This unit is operated by the Reclamation Project.
HUGH It is under the direct authority of its executive director: me.
HUGH Open up.
SOJI All the disordered are Romulans?
HUGH The only Romulans ever assimilated, as far as I know.
HUGH There she is.
SOJI Hi.
RAFFI What?
PICARD You're doing the research, aren't you?
RAFFI No.
PICARD I'm sending you everything that Daystrom had on Bruce Maddox.
RAFFI I don't want it.
PICARD Carry on.
PICARD Captain Rios?
EMH Oh. Hi. Hello.
PICARD Picard.
EMH Yes, sorry. Of course you are.
EMH I'm afraid you might be too late.
EMH Right, then. Come on.
EMH So, what seems to be the problem?
RIOS Are you kidding me? Hey.
PICARD Are you...?
RIOS Chris Rios. He's just an EMH.
EMH "Just?"
PICARD I'm, uh...
RIOS I know who you are.
RIOS I read one of your books one time.
PICARD What happened to you?
RIOS I didn't die.
RIOS Medkit.
RIOS Aguardiente.
PICARD No, thanks.
RIOS What you want to do is take the giant hunk of tritanium shrapnel out of the hole in my shoulder.
RIOS That's just a guess.
RIOS Please, sit.
RIOS Toss it anywhere.
RIOS So, where are we going, Admiral?
RIOS Raffi says you have no idea.
PICARD I'm working on it.
RIOS When are we leaving?
PICARD Soon as possible.
RIOS You breaking any laws or intending to?
PICARD I don't know.
PICARD I'm not in the habit of consulting lawyers before I do what needs to be done.
PICARD You?
RIOS I'm not in the habit of consulting anybody about anything.
RIOS Especially a lawyer.
EMH There we are.
EMH Now for the thermal regenerator.
RIOS Leave it. Give me that. Get lost.
EMH He never gets any nicer.
PICARD Duly noted.
RIOS Deactivate, EMH.
PICARD I need a pilot.
PICARD Raffi says you're the best around.
RIOS I never argue with Raffi.
PICARD Huh. Wise man.
PICARD You were the XO of a heavy cruiser?
RIOS The ibn Majid.
RIOS You never heard of it because it doesn't exist.
RIOS Starfleet erased it from the records.
PICARD Do I detect a certain bitterness toward Starfleet?
PICARD You must know that Starfleet and I long since have parted ways.
RIOS If you say so.
RIOS I really don't give a damn.
PICARD Oh, really?
PICARD I see this ship is impeccably maintained.
PICARD Every bolt and clasp and fitting in place.
PICARD Everything stowed in regulation Starfleet order.
PICARD I don't know what happened to you, Rios, or to the ibn Majid.
PICARD But five minutes on this ship, and I know precisely what I'm looking at.
PICARD You are Starfleet to the core.
PICARD I can smell it on you.
RIOS That's just my tragic sense of life.
RIOS Raffi warned me you were a speechmaker.
RIOS Look, Admiral, hire me or find another pilot.
RIOS Do not try to get inside my head.
ENH The navigation sensors are back at maximum range.
ENH Whatever it was, it scraped off pretty easily.
RIOS Mm-hmm.
ENH So are we excited?
ENH Intimidated?
ENH Maybe a teensy bit starstruck.
ENH Jean-Luc Picard.
ENH Chief contact with the Q Continuum.
ENH Arbiter of succession for the Klingon Empire.
ENH Savior of Earth from Borg invasion.
ENH Captain of the Enterprises D and E.
ENH The man even worked alongside the great Spock.
RIOS You are an emergency hologram.
RIOS We no longer have a navigational emergency.
RIOS Why are you still here?
ENH Well, someone is experiencing an acute moodiness overload.
ENH Picard is a good man, Captain Rios.
ENH He's on the side of the angels.
ENH It's been a long time since you helped out somebody like him.
ENH Hmm? A very long time.
RIOS Please, spare me the juvenile Sunday school morality.
ENH And spare me the angsty teenage moral relativism.
RIOS I already had one grand, heroic captain in my life.
RIOS The last thing I need is another one.
RIOS Ten years on, I still can't close my eyes at night without seeing the last one's blood and brains splattered all over a bulkhead.
RIOS Deactivate ENH.
ENH Aw, no, no, you...
PART THREE 
PICARD The familiar smell of harvest time.
PICARD Wood smoke, mown hay and that... heavy sweetness of the grapes.
LARIS And you won't miss it... any of it, one bit.
PICARD Oh, yes, my dear.
PICARD I will miss you and Zhaban and Number One.
PICARD I tried my best to belong to this place.
PICARD But I don't think I ever... truly felt at home here.
LARIS I suppose you always had one eye on the stars.
SOJI That looks like a door.
HUGH Very close. I think that one's called "shaipouin," which means...
SOJI A false door.
SOJI Traditional Romulan houses always have a false front door that's never used.
SOJI You have to go around the back.
HUGH You're kind of a know-it-all, aren't you?
SOJI If certain people requested entry would it be granted?
RAMDHA You may sit.
ZHABAN For the road. Bread.
ZHABAN Roquefort.
ZHABAN Madame Arnaud's terrine d'oie.
ZHABAN Far beyond the power of any replicator, I should think.
ZHABAN And last of the plum...
ZHABAN They killed the alarm.
LARIS Take 'em.
LARIS All right? All right.
JURATI Maybe... maybe... maybe it was on stun.
LARIS Romulan disruptors don't have a stun setting.
JURATI Okay.
PICARD It's all right.
PICARD Thank you.
PICARD It's all right.
PICARD Come.
PICARD Here.
JURATI Her name was Oh.
PICARD Chief of Starfleet Security.
PICARD A Vulcan.
JURATI You know her?
PICARD No, but I hear that she's very good at her job.
JURATI Sh-She wanted to know why you came to see me, and...
JURATI I'm sorry, but I told her.
JURATI Seemed too important not to.
JURATI And anyway, I'm a terrible liar.
PICARD Of course.
PICARD It's all right.
JURATI There's one thing I didn't tell her, though.
LARIS Zhaban.
ZHABAN We have no time, Laris. They'll send others.
LARIS We are not like them anymore.
LARIS Admiral, he's conscious.
PICARD Let's talk.
SOJI My name is Soji.
SOJI I'm working with Hugh on the reclamation project.
SOJI But I'm an anthropologist by training.
SOJI My presence is an intrusion, forgive it.
HUGH Ramdha has good days and bad days.
SOJI We all do.
SOJI Can you tell me about the cards, Ramdha?
SOJI The pixmit?
SOJI How do they work?
SOJI Do you tell fortunes with them?
SOJI It's kind of a mandala, is that it?
SOJI Do the images have a connection to Romulan mythology?
RAMDHA "Mythology"?
RAMDHA I hate that word.
RAMDHA In Romulan, we have no such word.
SOJI What's a better word?
SOJI Scriptures?
SOJI Sacred stories?
SOJI Legendarium?
RAMDHA The news.
SOJI I love that.
SOJI That's perfect.
SOJI The idea that former Borg might be able to create a mythol... a shared narrative framework for understanding their trauma, rooted in deep archetypes but as relevant as the day's news.
SOJI That's just what I'm hoping to do.
RAMDHA I know you.
PICARD Why is the Tal Shiar on Earth?
PICARD Are you Zhat Vash?
PICARD If you answer my questions, I will release you.
ZHABAN This is pointless.
LARIS Yes, because he's a... stubborn northerner, like you.
RAMDHA I remember you from tomorrow.
SOJI No, Ramdha. We've never met.
SOJI Okay, wh... what was I doing when you met me tomorrow?
SOJI One of the things that makes you so special, Ramdha, is that you were on board the very last ship ever assimilated by this cube.
HUGH Is that true?
HUGH How do you know that?
SOJI You were on board the Imperial scout ship Shaenor with 25 other passengers.
SOJI You encountered this cube. You were assimilated.
SOJI But then something went wrong.
SOJI What happened, Ramdha? Do you know?
SOJI What caused the submatrix collapse?
PART FOUR
PICARD Why did you kill that girl?
PICARD Why did you kill Dahj Asha?
ZHAT VASH AGENT She's not a girl.
RAMDHA Which one are you?
PICARD Just help me understand what is happening.
ZHAT VASH AGENT She's not what you think she is.
RAMDHA Which sister are you?
PICARD Why did you kill her?
PICARD Is there another one like her?
RAMDHA Which sister are you?
RAMDHA The one who dies or the one who lives?!
PICARD Where is she?
PICARD Where is the other one?
ZHAT VASH AGENT You'll never find her before we do, qezhtihn!
RAMDHA I know who you are!
RAMDHA You are Seb-Cheneb.
RAMDHA You are the Destroyer!
ZHAT VASH AGENT She's the end of all!
ZHAT VASH AGENT She's the Destroyer.
PICARD Damn.
SOJI No!
HUGH Let her go!
HUGH She's fine.
HUGH He's the one that needs to be disciplined.
HUGH Get him out of here. Get him out.
HUGH And make sure your own sidearms are fully secured.
DAHJ'S MOM Hi, sweetie.
SOJI Mom...
DAHJ'S MOM Sweetie, what's wrong?
SOJI Mom- Mom, is Dahj okay?
DAHJ'S MOM What? Is she okay?
DAHJ'S MOM Yes, sweetie, Dahj is fine.
DAHJ'S MOM I just heard from her today.
DAHJ'S MOM She sounds like she's doing great.
DAHJ'S MOM She's thinking of adopting a puppy.
DAHJ'S MOM I'm not sure that's the best idea.
DAHJ'S MOM But you know Dahj... when she makes a plan, you can never talk her out of it. I don't know.
DAHJ'S MOM Sometimes I think I should tell her the opposite thing to do...
SOJI Enter.
NAREK Are you all right?
NAREK Hey.
HAREK What happened?
SOJI I have no idea. I mean... if you had asked me five minutes beforehand, I would have said I didn't know anything about a Romulan ship.
SOJI I would have said that I'd never even heard of the Shaenor or that Ramdha was on it.
NAREK And would that have been the truth?
SOJI I've probably read every unclassified document that there is pertaining to the history of this cube.
SOJI It must have been in there somewhere.
SOJI Even Romulan censors have to slip up sometimes.
SOJI Do you believe me?
NAREK Can you keep a secret?
NAREK I may be falling in love with you.
LRAFFI I'm back.
NAREK So are your ears.
LRAFFI I can smell her on you.
LRAFFI The smell is remarkably... carnal.
LRAFFI She really is an extraordinary piece of machinery.
LRAFFI What's she told you?
NAREK Nothing yet.
NAREK I'm not sure what she consciously knows, but... I'm sure she has no idea what she truly is.
NAREK And given what happened on Earth...
NAREK I think we should keep it that way as long as possible.
LRAFFI Earth was a miscalculation.
NAREK Your miscalculation.
LRAFFI Which is the only reason I agreed to let you pursue this highly questionable...
NAREK Far more subtle...
LRAFFI approach.
LRAFFI Good luck, brother.
LRAFFI And see that you don't fall in love.
NAREK Nice to see you looking like yourself again.
PICARD You said you told Commodore Oh everything about our conversation except for one thing... what was that?
JURATI That I'm going with you.
JURATI To look for the girl, Dahj.
JURATI The other Dahj.
JURATI You are going to look for her, right?
JURATI That's what Oh thought, that y-you were planning to get a ship and a pilot and go off looking for the second synth.
JURATI Are you?
PICARD You're early.
RIOS Nope. My sources tell me...
PICARD What sources?
RIOS ...it's about to get very hot chez vous.
PICARD It's already hot.
RIOS Hotter.
JURATI Is that your pilot? Mm-hmm.
JURATI Okay. You have to take me with you, and here's why: A, I just killed a man to save your life;
JURATI B, you are a good, decent man, capable of empathy and pity, and... I am a scientist who has spent her entire life imagining a miracle, knowing that it could never come to pass, and now it has, and it's real, and I have to see her;
JURATI and, C, I don't know how much it costs to go where you're going or... how much this guy charges...
RIOS I'm expensive.
JURATI ...but I'm Agnes P. Jurati.
JURATI I'm the Earth's leading expert on synthetic life, and I promise you, if you take me with you, I will more than earn my keep.
RIOS Time to go.
PICARD Raffi?
PICARD What is this?
PICARD Ah, "sources."
RAFFI I found Maddox.
PICARD Where is he?
RAFFI I tell you, you promise you'll take me with you?
PICARD I would be honored to have you join me.
RAFFI Oh, no, no, I'm- I'm not joining you.
RAFFI Never again.
RAFFI I'm just hitching a ride.
PICARD To where?
RAFFI Bruce Maddox is on Freecloud.
PICARD Freecloud.
PICARD Yes, of course.
JURATI Why do you want to go to Freecloud?
RAFFI Have we met?
JURATI Agnes Jurati.
RAFFI That's it?
RAFFI You're just gonna let Agnes here hitch a ride on your top secret mission?
PICARD Dr.Jurati is the Earth's leading expert on synthetic life.
RAFFI You didn't even ask me to run any kind of security check, not even the most basic.
PICARD Why do you want to go to Freecloud?
RAFFI I'm under no obligation to tell that to any of you.
RAFFI And once we get there, you're on your own.
JURATI Who are you, lady?
RIOS Can we go already?
PICARD Yes, fine.
PICARD Engage.
THE END
