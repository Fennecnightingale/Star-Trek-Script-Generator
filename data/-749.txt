PART ONE 

(heart beating)

(inhaling, exhaling)

SRK Michael.

(alarm sounding)

(indistinct chatter)

BRN 
Personal log, stardate 1051.8.

Thank you.
You got it.

We're in the process
of abandoning our ship

in order to destroy it.

This is actually happening,
yet somehow

I still can't believe it.

Long-range sensors show
Control is on the move

and gaining quickly.

It's infiltrated
our subspace radio relays,

so we can't reach Starfleet
for backup.

Ship-to-ship communication
is all we've got.

DET Discovery to Enterprise,
we're at 20, 15,

ten, nine,

eight...

...seven, six, five...

Engaging reverse thrusters.

Three... two...

Docking sequence initiated.

Evacuation corridors deployin.

Bridge is five by,
and hold for airlock breach.

BRN Discovery contains
the one thing in all the galaxy

that Control needs, the data
to become fully conscious.

My mother sacrificed everything
to stop Control

from getting that data,

and now she's counting on us
to finish the job.

But is this really
the only solution?

I look in the mirror

and can hardly recognize
myself anymore.

All of these questions
without answers.

There are seven signals,
but we've only seen four.

We have a time crystal
that we don't know how to use.

Captain Pike has always had
faith that they play a part

in some grand design.

Now... more than ever...

I wish I had his certainty.

PKE  Burnham, let's move.
The ship's almost clear.

It's time to get the crystal
over to Enterprise.

BRN The signal led us to Boreth
for this. Why?

My mother's gone,
the suit's destroyed,

Now Discovery.

It can't just be
about endings, can it?

PKE We can figure it out, Commander,
but only if we're walking.

BRN I cannot let everything
my mother sacrificed for

be for nothing.

PKE Sometimes

we know the role we're meant
to play, sometimes we don't.

I'm not sure which is better,
to be honest.

BRN And we don't know if we'll have
the strength, do we?

Until the moment comes.

SAR Final crew are
departing, Captain.

We should proceed.
PKE Understood, Mr. Saru.

- You got that?
BRN - Yes, sir.

(sighs)

(echoing voices)

RHYS Shields unable
to absorb full impact!

(echoing voices)

LEL Goodbye.

COMP Remote auto-destruct enabled.

(powering down)

SAR Life support, environmental
controls, and gravity generators

will deactivate
in five minutes.

All Discovery crew is accounted
for on the Enterprise, Captain.

PKE Field generators disengaged?
Affirmative.

SAR Shields are also off-line,
and the warp core

has been prepared
for overload.

PKE Have we forgotten anything?

SAR There will be
no half measures, sir.

She will go with the dignity
she deserves.

Commander.

(indistinct chatter)

PKE Deck one.

BRN You brought
Siranna's knife.

SAR My sister would not
be pleased to hear

that I had left it behind.

And it gives me hope
that we will endure.

(indistinct chatter)

MAN:
Captain on the bridge.

ADM She's all yours, Chris.

PKE She looks as good as I remember.

NUM Welcome home, Captain.

PKE Good to be back.

Wish it were
under better circumstances.

NUM Don't we all.

All major systems
are back online,

and we'll have no more
holographic communications...

ever.

PKE Probably for the best.

Lieutenant Amin,
status update.

AMIN Sensors show
Leland and his armada

are picking up speed, Captain.

MAN Captain Georgiou
has just arrived, sir.

Permission to
come aboard?

PKE Granted. Have her come on up.

Number One, take us
to a safe distance, please.

NUM Aye, Captain.

PKE Captain Georgiou,
welcome to the Enterprise.

GRG Orange? Really? Ugh.

Your report
on Specialist Gant

was rather enlightening.

Nanobots.

BRN Yes. Now is not the time.

GRG Nonsense. It's good
to get a little distance

from something you love.

On the other hand, I look
forward to hunting Leland down

to the ends of the galaxy
so I can watch

every piece of technology
exit his skin bit by bit.

BRN Leland didn't deserve
what he got.

GRG Better him than me. Or you.

NUMB We're at distance, sir.

PKE All right, everyone. Eyes front.

We'll never see
another like her.

Initiate remote auto-destruct.

COMP Auto-destruct initiated.

Counting down. Five, four,

three, two,

one.

Detonation.

Auto-destruct failure.

SAR That is not possible.

PKE Arm photon torpedoes.

AMIN Photon torpedoes ready.

(distorted audio)

PKE Fire.

NUM Captain, Discovery's shields are up.

ADM What the hell?
PKE Again.

(photon torpedoes fire)

Analysis.

SPK Given recent
events, I believe the Sphere data

may be the cause.
BRN It's protecting itself.

We tried to delete the data;
it wouldn't let us.

SAR If the data has merged with
Discovery, that would explain

its ability to use
Discovery's resources

to ensure its survival.

ADM Are you saying we won't be
able to destroy the ship?

NUM (echoing)
Leland's ships are now in range,

Captain.

(indistinct chatter)

(screaming)

(indistinct shouting)

OWO An undetonated photon torpedo

is lodged in Enterprise's hull,

deck five, section two. 
SAR Magnify.

OWO We've lost shields!

(groaning)

(coughs)

NAHN Commander, we've been boarded.

♪ ♪

(groaning)

GRG Aah!

(groaning)

LEL Goodbye.
BRN Aah!

SAR That is not possible.

PKE Arm photon torpedoes.

AMIN Photon torpedoes ready.

BRN Stop!

Excuse me, Captain.

It won't work.

PKE What do you mean?

The Sphere's data has already
merged with Discovery.

We should have anticipated
it would use our ship

and our shields

to protect itself,
like it's always done.

SPK You sound rather certain.

BRN I am.

PKE How long until
Leland gets here?

NUM An hour. Maybe less.

PKE Options. 

BRN We know we
can't delete the data.

SAR Nor, it seems,
can we destroy Discovery.

BRN Even if you jump away,
Control will not stop coming.

ADM Eventually Leland,
or some version of him,

would find you.

SPK Ergo, Discovery's very existence
is the problem.

BRN Of course.

As long as Discovery
exists here and now,

this will never be over.

SAR You are proposing

we remove Discovery
from the galactic equation

entirely?

PKE How, exactly, are we
supposed to do that?

BRN The crystal.

This is why we have it.

To take the data out
of this time

so Control can never get it.

Discovery has to go
to the future.

PKE How do we get
Discovery to the future

before Leland catches up
with us?

ADM Dr. Burnham's suit
was destroyed on Essof IV.

That was the only method
of time travel we know of.

SAR We have the technical designs

from Section 31.

We can attempt to rebuild it.

PKE Do it. To my physical
specifications, please.

STA That's not possible, sir.

The suit was tailored
to Dr. Burnham's DNA.

BRN Which makes my MRNA
the closest genetic match.

I'll do it.

My mother started this.
I'm gonna finish it.

STA Even if we could adapt
the code to your biology,

the exoskeleton is made
from a composite alloy

that we can't synthesize.

BRN Well, the alloy is
tritanium-based.

It might be possible
to melt down

part of a cargo bulkhead
to cast a mold.

NUM Not to sweat the details,

but do you even know how
to fly the thing?

BRN I learned the basics
from her logs.

I'm sure there'll be
some trial and error

opening the wormhole.

SAR If Discovery were
on autopilot,

it could follow you through.

ADM How will you find
your way back?

PKE Everything we know
about the signals

suggests they're indicative
of a design.

I'm willing to trust that.

GRG Are you saying you believe

that another signal
will just reveal itself

because we need it to?

SPK These signals could
only have been set

by an individual
with access to a time suit

and knowledge of our
specific circumstances.

We believed your mother was
the only Red Angel.

However, the bioneural signature
identified another.

You. Her efforts
were focused entirely

on the Sphere data.

She stated that she did not
set the signals.

Therefore, you did.

BRN But if it was me, why?

What am I trying
to lead us to?

SPK That remains to be seen.

But I agree with
Captain Pike.

There is intention
to your design.

STA I'll have our engineering team
start the fabrication process.

SAR And the time crystal.

There is still the matter
of activating it.

BRN My parents used
a stellar-lensing array.

If we can locate
an unstable red giant...

NUM The odds of finding one

in any given sector
are pretty high.

STA But pretty low of finding one

in a supernova state
specifically.

It can take hundreds of years.

GRG So pick a nova and fire
an antimatter missile

into its core.

SAR We would be directly responsible
for destroying

all life within dozens of
light-years, if not more.

GRG Yeah.
Uh...

BRN We're not doing that.

GRG I thought there were
no bad ideas.

PKE That's a lie.
ADM That's a bad one.

PART TWO 

NICOLA Admiral, Captain Pike,

there's something
you need to see.

PKE And then there were five.

BRN Do we have a lock
on the signal?

AMIN Still working on it.

MANN Sensors show Captain Leland...

Control... is five minutes out.

PKE Red alert.

Mr. Saru,
we'll return to Discovery

with all essential personnel.

Commander Stamets, you will
jump us to that signal.

SAR Yes, Captain.
 Copy that.

ADM I'll get Enterprise to the
signal as fast as possible.

GRG I'll join you.

PKE Have any personnel
not directly involved

with fabricating
the time suit start

retrofitting all shuttles
and pods for combat operations.

You should do the same.

It'll be us against
whatever Leland's bringing.

NUM Actually, our odds might be
a little better than that.

I took the liberty
of retrofitting our shuttle

and landing pod complement
with enhanced phasers,

and I commandeered the new
experimental tactical flyers,

assuming the shit
would hit the fan.

PKE Well done, Number One.

ADM Godspeed, Captain.

PKE You, too, Admiral.

We'll rendezvous
at the fifth signal.

PKE And where has
the signal led us now?

BRN Class M planet... 

Xahea.

TLY Really? Xahea?

Wait, for real?

PKE What do you know, Ensign?

TLY The queen.
The queen?

Yeah, yeah, no, no.
I-I-I know the queen of Xahea.

We share a love of engineering.

PKE And what might
Xahea have to do

with powering the time crystal?

TLY Well, Xahea's remarkable for
its natural dilithium supply.

And its queen,
Her Serene Highness.

Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po...

or-or Po for short,
she, uh, she's only 17,

but she developed a technology
to recrystallize it.

SAR To recrystallize
dilithium?

Well, if true, Starfleet
would no longer

need to seek new sources
of dilithium for its warp cores.

TLY She's brilliant... but she won't
tell anyone how she did it.

She-she doesn't trust anyone
with that information.

PKE So, besides being brilliant,
she's also prudent.

 Mr. Bryce, open a channel.
BRY  Yes, sir.

PKE Let's see if Ensign Tilly
can convince.

Her Serene Highness
to help us figure out

why the signal brought us here.

TLY I think she'll be
intrigued, sir,

and probably happy she doesn't
have to stuff herself

into a cargo pallet.

PKE What?

TLY Hmm? Nothing.

STA Reset the cube and
don't forget to purge

the secondary EPS relay.

CREWMAN Yes, sir.
Quickly, quickly.

We have shuttles
and pods to retrofit.

(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

HUGH Are you all right?

From the jump.

STA I-I'm fine... thank you.

HUGH Listen...
STA Listen...

HUGH You go.

STA Um... once Commander Burnham

takes this ship to
wherever she's going...

I'm thinking
I might take a break

from starships.

I passed up a job at
the Vulcan Science Academy

a few months ago.

Or maybe I'll just... live
on a station for a while.

I don't know.

HUGH Forward motion.

I get it.

STA I thought a lot about it,
and... you were right.

If I can take anything

from all this,

it's that forward motion...

is the most honest choice...

for both of us.

HUGH Thank you for saying that.

STA I hope that...

whatever life
you find from here,

whoever you find it with...

...that you're happy, Hugh.

HUGH You, too, Paul.

Once the Enterprise
catches up with us...

...I'll be joining them.

STA Of course.

I need to see how the...
fabrication team is doing

with the suit.

BRN Ice cream is the last thing
I was expecting.

TLY Oh, she's all about sugar.
You have no idea.

PKE Your Serene Highness, may I...

PO Tilly!

(Tilly and Po giggle)

Is that spumoni?

(sniffs)

My calculations for
small-particle dispersion

in hydrogenated carbohydrates
were so on point.

But I just end up with goo.

BRN Fascinating.

TLY Po, this is.

Commander Michael Burnham.

PO Your roomie.

You look taller
in your photos.

BRN Thank you...

TLY And this is Captain Pike.
This is the captain.

PKE Your Highness,
Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po.

PO Wow, you're good.

Po's fine.
PKE Thank you.

Can you eat and walk?
I'll fill you in on the way.

PO Mm-hmm.

So, you have a time crystal,

which I've only
ever read about,

and no method by which
to activate it.

And you have a time suit.

Which genius built that?

BRN My mom.

PO Hmm. I had a special mom, too.

GRG Ugh.

PO So you want
to use the suit

to travel through time

with this ship flying
behind you, yes? 
BRN Yes.

PO And then you want
to cut the ship loose

and come back alone?

Hmm.
GRG This endeavor would be

rather ridiculous
if Michael intended

to return with the ship.

PO One of the fun things
about becoming queen

of the most
politically relevant

planet in the galaxy
is that

I don't have to listen
to any snark.

I made it an actual law.
GRG What?

PKE Oh, uh, we believe
that there's Ugh.

A reason the signal
brought us to your planet.

TLY What's happening?

JET It's nuclear particle physics.

Pretty sure
she's calculating

the reaction rate
between particles.

E = mc squared stuff.

PO I like you.

JET - I like you, too.
GRG Good.

We're friends now.

The goop in this bowl
is vile.

PO I can modify
my dilithium incubator

to trigger an ongoing
cascade of energy

within the crystal
by combining it

with dark energy.

It'll replicate the power
of a supernova.

And charge your crystal.

I get to make a supernova.

Today rocks.

I will need
energy, though.

Like, Planck-level.

JET That's a little
more than the EPS grid

normally allows.

BRN We could pull from
the spore drive.

TLY It would take 12 hours
for the spore drive to recover.

How are we supposed to fight
off dozens of enemy ships

without being able
to jump away?

We'd be... going into battle
without our spore drive.

PKE If that's what it takes
to power the suit,

we'll have to make it work.

PO Good.

There is just one problem.

Certain death in battle
wasn't enough of a problem?

JET
This is bigger.

Charging the crystal this way
is like using a waterfall

to get a drink of water.

It'll work, but then you drown.

BRN I don't... follow.

SPK I believe
what they wish to convey

is that continuous regeneration

of energy will
ultimately overwhelm

the structural integrity
of the crystal.

Causing it to burn out.

BRN Meaning, I can take Discovery

to the future.

But I won't be able
to come back.

(overlapping comm chatter)

It's a one-way trip.

ASH You're leaving? Forever?

SPK That is correct.

To ensure the
Sphere data remains

out of Leland's reach,

Michael must remain
in the future.

Permanently.

ASH What does that even mean?

Where in the future?

BRN Assuming I don't get lost
in the wormhole,

in theory,

my mother should have returned

to her anchor point
on Terralysium.

So hopefully I will
land there, too.

And there's no
technology there,

so Discovery will be safe.
ASH "In theory"?

"Hopefully"? Michael, you could
land anywhere in any time.

GRG We are aware.

BRN Apparently, this
is what I'm meant to do.

Trust the mystery.

DET Are you sure there's
no other way?

PKE If there were, we
would have found it.

Commander Burnham will use
the suit to open a wormhole.

Discovery will be n
autopilot behind her.

Our job is to clear a path.

Anything in
the vicinity will be

either destroyed
or pulled into the future

with her,
and we cannot risk that.

ASH This is crazy.
We have a spore drive.

JET Sorry, lovebug,
we don't.

STA We need the power
to charge the crystal.

It won't be
up and running again

until long after
Michael's gone.

SAR Captain, the Enterprise
will arrive in 57 minutes.

Control is only ten minutes
behind them.

PKE All right.

This is what you've trained for.

Eyes up for Commander Burnham.

BRN I wish there was
more time.

There isn't.

I love you.

All of you.

Thank you for the greatest
moments of my life.

PKE Thank you all.

Let's get that crystal charged
and get to work.

PART THREE 

(overlapping chatter)

PO You're afraid.

(laughs nervously)

TLY It'll be fine.

PO Better than fine,
whatever happens.

TLY  You give me too much credit.
PO No.

You taught me to walk tall and
straight into the heart of it.

Just like you'll teach
your crew one day

when you have your own
ship to command.

TLY Thank you for helping us.

You're helping us pretty much
save the entire galaxy.

You didn't have to do that.
You could have just...

PO Stayed out of it?

No.

My people, my planet,
they're at risk, too.

TLY Oh, can I just say that
I love the way you say that?

"My planet."
"My people."

Look how far you've come.
It's beautiful, Po.

Even this thing is bizarre
and super weird,

but it's beautiful.

PO Pair production's begun.

There'll be enough dark energy
for the crystal soon.

TLY I'm gonna miss you,
young lady.

PO What do you mean?
I'm not going anywhere.

TLY What?

No. No, you can't stay
on board, you're the queen.

PO Exactly. My planet
is my sister.

If I die, I die
protecting her.

That's the only queen
I know how to be.

Besides,
what am I supposed to do...

wave a hanky from my throne?

We're a team, all of us.

You're stuck with me.

GRG This is stupid.
BRN What?

GRG You flinging yourself
into the future

like some galactic rubber band
with a martyr complex.

BRN It doesn't have
to be like this.

It does have to be like this

for a million reasons
you will never understand.

GRG I understand perfectly.

You're very invested
in being selfless, Michael.

And I'm not the only one willing
to exploit that, you know.

BRN You can add this up
however you want.

I'm getting in that suit and
I'm doing what I need to do.

And if we're both still alive
when this is all over,

then you can talk to me about
my gaping character flaws.

(door whooshes open)

How did you know?

SRK Our katras.

AMD We had tried to reach you
through Starfleet.

BRN Control took down
our subspace relays.

We only have ship-to-ship.

SRK You're truly leaving us,
Michael.

BRN We can't allow the data to stay.

It's the only way.

AMD Michael, you do not
have to do this.

BRN Mother, yes, I do.

I had lost everything.

I was broken...

and I was alone.

(voice breaking) You both...
put me back together.

Piece by piece.

Even though
you had a son,

you took me in
as your daughter.

And as much as I tried
to push you away,

you never let me go.

And I love you for
never letting me go.

And I need you both to know

that what you gave me,

I will carry it everywhere I go.

And I will never let you down.

AMD Michael, we are
so proud of you...

and your courage

and what you are about
to do for everyone.

SRK It is the secret
wish of every parent that

our children make right
the mistakes

we ourselves have made.

I know I have not always been

the ideal father.

Or husband, Amanda.

I am...
AMD Impossible.

(laughs)

SRK Uh,
I will accept improbable.

(laughs)

BRN Well, that's big of you, Father.

SRK For my failures
I humbly ask both of you

for forgiveness.

BRN Of course.

Promise me that
you'll take care of Spock.

SRK I will always be here
for our son, always.

Even as I keep
my distance,

as he has asked.

BRN He loves you very deeply.

So do I.

AMD Michael.

We love you.

GAB Time travel is not
for the faint of heart.

Every jump,
I say a silent thank you

to whatever brilliant being

invented polyphobic
metamaterial.

Without her or him,
I'd be dead from radiation,

temperature fluctuations,
or painful blood clots.

Humans were not meant for this.

And that's the easy part.

Navigation, on the other hand...

Now I really hope whoever
you are, watching this someday,

you're not crazy enough
to try a jump,

but if you're as half
as stubborn as I am,

let me tell you how
to do it the right way.

BOTH Nav system appears
right before your eyes.

PKE (over comm) All
personnel, this is the captain.

20 minutes until
the Enterprise arrives.

Captain Georgiou,
report to the ready room.

Commander Burnham,
to the bridge immediately.

TLY You announced that
you're leaving forever,

and I wasn't even there to sob
and wail and throw myself

 at your feet.
BRN You were a little busy.

And our goodbye needed to be...

TLY Nonexistent.

It's not who we are, Michael.

It's not who any of us are.

Some people are
still working.

Uh, Po is designing siege
weapons, which I can't even...

Anyway, we're here

because we're
staying with you.

BRN No.

No, I can't let you do this.

JET We're not asking permission.

BRN This is impossible.
You have lives.

You have people who love you.

Families who love you.
You'll never see them again.

SAR Commander, our families accepted
the possibility of this moment

when we joined Starfleet.

Committing to a life

amongst the stars
is, in itself,

a resolution to leave
some things behind.

BRN But I don't know
what the future holds.

STA Nobody does.

We just have now.

SPK We are coming with you, Michael.

Further argument
would be futile.

Please accept this.

(stammers)
SAR I am sure

what you are about to say
will be beautiful,

but it is done, Michael,
and we are running out of time.

TLY That's kind of a problem,
actually, because the crystal

isn't charging as
fast as it should be.

JET I got you, Red. Lead the way.

MAN (over P.A.):
All personnel...

(continues indistinctly)

ASH Michael.

BRN You're not coming, are you?

ASH I wish I could say yes.

B-But someone has to make sure
nothing like Control

ever happens again, someone
inside the gray areas.

BRN In Section 31?

ASH Otherwise we could be right back
here no matter where you end up.

PKE Commander Burnham,
the Enterprise will be here

in 11 minutes.
Are you on your way?

BRN I'll be right there.

(sobs)

PART FOUR 

SAR There is a
battle coming, Siranna.

I do not know if this message
will reach you in time.

The odds are not in our favor.

If we never
see each other again,

you must know, sweet sister,

how much I love you.

TLY I'll never know
if I made you proud.

I hope so.

But even if I haven't,
I made myself proud.

And I can, um,
feel how you respect that.

Mom, I can feel it.

OWO I can feel I frightened you
by making my own path.

I hope you see this one day
and that you'll forgive me.

I'll keep all of you
deep within me.

DET I wish we had more time.

I wish I could tell you
this in person, but...

you're my rock, Tazzy.

Every test I tanked,
the 28 times I wanted to quit,

and after my injury.

It only takes one person,
I guess, to save another.
You're my best friend...
STA You're my best friend,

and you always could translate
Mom and Dad to me

and vice versa.

Even though I still don't know

what Dad's talking about
half the time.

I know you think
I was their favorite...

(laughs)
but I'm just louder.

They love you so much.

They would do anything for you.

PKE It's time.

Lieutenant Detmer, put some
distance between us and Xahea.

This is our fight, not theirs.
DET Yes, Captain.

SAR Captain, I have no
confirmation Her Serene Highness

has left the ship.

PKE We'll have to have

that diplomatic meltdown
some other time.

I won't bother asking if you've
all committed to this decision.

In that case,

one last bit of housekeeping
before I can leave this ship.

Discovery is going
to need a new captain.

Serving as your captain has been

one of the greatest honors
of my career.

You are exceptional officers.

Exceptional individuals,
every single one of you.

Lieutenants Detmer and Owosekun,

I wouldn't be here if you hadn't
saved my life on the way

to that asteroid.

Lieutenant Nilsson,
you've stepped up for Airiam

in a way that honors her.

Lieutenants Bryce and Rhys,
you're calm under pressure.

And Commander Saru,

I'm gonna miss
the hell out of you.

Lieutenant Spock...

...there aren't words.

Commander Nhan has
requested permission

to stay aboard Discovery.

NAHN If I can be of help, that is.

SAR Well... it would be our privilege
to have you, Commander.

PKE As for you...

...most people will
never get a chance

to learn what's
in their own hearts.

If we figure it out, it's
often not what we expected,

or even what we would have
chosen for ourselves.

I am very grateful, Commander,

to have been here to watch you
discover your heart.

Thank you.

I know that you...
I know that all of you

will face your destinies
with bravery and honor.

Even those moments to come

that will test the
strongest among us.

BRN Thank you... sir.

PKE Mr. Saru,

you have the conn
as Commander Burnham leads you

through the wormhole.

As to what happens after that...

SAR I would prefer if we focus
on our respective tasks for now

and discuss the captaincy later.

There are many things
to consider.

NUM Enterprise to Discovery.

Control's fleet will be arriving

in four minutes, 58 seconds,
Captain.

PKE Thank you, Number One.
Mr. Bryce,

make sure anyone else who wants to
leave is on their way.

BRY Aye, Captain.
PKE The rest of you...

...back to work.

BRN Captain Pike.
(overlapping comm chatter)

STA At this rate, the
crystal won't be charged

before Leland arrives.

And you do know

that the suit is utterly useless
without the crystal, don't you?

TLY Preacher, choir. Why do
you think I asked for help?

Sir, sorry, I,

I get a little snarky
when I'm stressed.

JET The problem is the cage. It's
interfering with the charge.

TLY Yeah, but without the cage...

JET Everyone will see visions
of the future

and their heads will explode,
I know.

STA Okay, ideas. Go.

JET Well, we could move the charging
unit inside the cage.

STA And potentially redistribute
the charge

to the point of instability?

No. Next?

TLY Well, what if we, uh, increase

the diameter
of the cage openings?

That way, the wavelength

of the charging frequency
can move through faster.

STA And that may let the effects
of the crystal seep out,

which is why the cage is there.

BRY Attention: final
shuttles are departing.

Transporter power diverting

to defense systems
in three minutes.

JET Okay, out, both of you.

Make sure nobody else comes in.

STA Wait. You're not gonna...

JET Got a better idea?

The mission's the mission,
whatever I see.

Look, buck up, guys.

I'll be fine.

TLY Thank you, Jett.

STA I still dislike you.

JET Feeling's mutual.

OWO An undetonated
photon torpedo is lodged

in Enterprise's hull!

SAR Mr. Bryce, open a ship-wide
channel, please.

Aye, sir.

BRY Channel open.

SAR This is Commander Saru.

All crew to stations
immediately.

Red alert.
(alarm sounding)

Captain, we are standing by.

PKE Leaving now, Mr. Saru.

I haven't been sure
what to make of you lately,

but I'm glad to have had you
on our side for this.

GRG More fun to come,
assuming we survive.

PKE Good luck.

Glad to have you
on our side, too, Mr. Tyler.

ASH As am I.

Does that mean you trust me?

PKE Why do you ask?

ASH Because there's something
I need to do.

And it means leaving
before any of this starts.

GRG Initializing.

I'm Terran, by the way.

From your mirror universe.

PKE What mirror universe?

DET Attention, all vessels.

Leland's fleet has arrived.

WOMAN Captain on the bridge.

NUM Nine more enemy vessels just
dropped out of warp, Captain.

BRN We are surrounded.

RHYS All enemy vessels
armed and ready.

PKE Shields up.

SAR Prepare for battle.
