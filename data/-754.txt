PART ONE

HUGH Medical officer's log,
supplemental.

Our trip to Earth
was eyeopening.

A reality check,
such as reality is.

It's starting to hit everyone

just how little
we have to hold on to.

The personal moments
we use to define ourselves,

birthdays,

anniversaries, graduations,

funerals,

we've jumped past all of them.

They feel lost.

Disconnected.

I tell them I've been alone,
I've been lost.

Both are survivable,

and surviving
can become living again.

You know, if you ever needed
to talk, I'm around.

DET I'm fine.

HUGH But first,
they have to accept help.

For a crew of overachievers,

that kind of vulnerability
can be hard to hold.

Five words keep everyone going:

"When we find the Federation."

It's become a mantra
for the crew.

In some cases, it seems to help.

All right.

In others...

...not so much.

Adira, who joined us from
Earth, may be able to guide s

to Federation headquarters one
she regains her own memoris

and those of her symbiont's
former host, Senna Tal.

This mission could be a gift,

a reminder that we are
and always will be connected

to something greater
than ourselves: the Federation.

Scan complete.

Well, the good news is,
she's perfectly healthy,

as is the symbiont.

SAR Uh, should we be concerned
it is wrapped around her heart?

ADI No, it's protecting me.

Every critical system in my body
is connected to Tal.

Wake up with a squid
in your abdominal cavity,

you'll do your homework, too.

BRN So you still don't remember

how you got the symbiont?

ADI What's the first thing
you do remember?

I woke up in an escape pod
a year ago

when that ship found me.

Before that, nothing.

SAR Uh, Commander Stamets noted
that you demonstrated

a surprising understanding
of our ship's engineering grid,

a design about which
you should have no knowledge.

ADI Well, I can also speak
seven languages

and cook
a mean Bajoran hasperat.

I mean, have I always
been a genius,

or do these skills belong
to my squid's previous hosts?

BRN Well, if it is your sym...
Your squid...

Then we should be getting
the full picture.

So something is blocking
your memories.

ADI Like what?

HUGH Oh, there's no way to know.

There's no precedent.

So, we have two choices:

I can start digging around
your hippocampus,

hoping to find an answer...
ADI Bad.

HUGH Bad.

Or we take you to Trill.

If you and the captain agree.

POL Adira, we have to be clear.

No one's ever seen a human host.

There's no way of knowing if the
Trill will be able or willing

to assist you.

ADI So I could go,
and it could be a bust,

and no one gets what they need.

I don't get my memories, you
don't get Senna Tal's message

and you never find
Federation headquarters.

BRN Is there any way of knowing

if the Trill are as peaceful
as they were

a millennia ago?

SAR No. That is also a risk.

ADI I can't keep living like this.

Not knowing who I am.

Let's go to Trill.

RHYS Scans confirm
no weapon energy signatures.

Nothing to indicate
hostile intent.

SAR Well, let us hope
that remains the case.

Keep us at yellow alert.

Lieutenant Bryce,
open a channel, please.

BRY Yes, sir.

BRN Ring any bells?

Does that planet look familiar?

ADI Wish I could say yes.

BRY All right, Captain,
Trill Commissioner Vos

is responding to our hail.

SAR Put him through, Lieutenant.

Welcome, Commissioner Vos.

I am Captain Saru
of the USS Discovery.

TRILL Greetings, Captain Saru.

It's been many years since we've
seen a Federation starship.

SAR I trust our arrival is welcome?

TRILL Most certainly.

SAR We have a host and symbiont

on board, uh,
in need of medical attention.

We were hoping
for your assistance.

TRILL Our symbionts carry our history.

And then the... The Burn.

The population was decimated.

To have a symbiont return home
is a blessing.

SAR Uh, we will send them down
immediately

accompanied by our ship's
medical officer.

TRILL We'll make preparations.

SAR Thank you, Discovery.

Cancel yellow alert,
maintain standard orbit.

Dr. Stamets.

I would like to talk to you
about your jumps.

STA Second jump with no problems.

Fully recovered. I'm fine.

SAR You were impaled with a spike
and placed in a coma.

TLY Yeah, but other than that,
he's fine.

STA I can jump anytime.

SAR The scarcity of dilithium
has made the spore drive

immeasurably valuable.

We will need the ability
to operate it

without you, Commander.

STA I researched
the nonhuman interface

for nearly a decade before
we discovered the Tardigrade

on the Glenn.

SAR Yes, and there has been
932 years

of technological advancement
since then.

We cannot risk
becoming as limited

as every other ship
in the galaxy

should you be once again
incapacitated.

STA Of course, Captain.

SAR Now, you and Ensign Tilly

are two of the finest minds
on this ship.

I have every confidence
you will find a solution.

TLY So, look, II know
now may not be the best time...

Um, what if we made
a new interface

using a dark matter system?

STA Dark matter is comprised
of subatomic particles

and the mycelial network
is a subspace domain.

The prefix "sub"
being the only morpheme

that even remotely connects
those two ideas.

TLY Yeah.

I... Well, I've run
some preliminary calculations

using dark matter energy toto
pierce the subspace domain,

but if... look... you're not ready
to talk about it, it's...

STA Look, this isn't about
"Isn't science cool?"

It's about the lives
of everything and everyone.

I know you're trying,

but please, don't waste my time.

PART TWO

BRN Come.

HUGH Do you have a minute?

BRN Please.

HUGH You've been busy.
BRN Mm.

It's everything I've managed
to find on The Burn

in the last year.

So many missing pieces.

HUGH Oh, I just, I meant,
your space used to be so, uh...

BRN Oh.

Empty?

HUGH Yeah.

BRN Shouldn't you, uh,
be headed to the shuttle now?

HUGH Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

I think you should be the one
to take Adira to the surface.

Her memory loss
isn't a medical problem.

She needs somebody
to support her emotionally.

BRN Why do you think that's me?

HUGH Well, Adira's had almost
everything she's depended on

stripped away.

I think you understand that.

BRN I think you do, too.

HUGH Mmhmm.

You know, there's a theory:
posttraumatic growth.

That, uh,
certain life events, um,

dying, time travel,

a year alone in a new future,

can inspire us to evolve,

to live our lives
in a different way.

You're still in the process
of all that,

but Adira's about to start.

BRN I don't even know
how to navigate

being on this ship right now.

And the people
that I know and love,

I know what they want from me...

...but I can't even
give it to them.

HUGH You know what I love
about you most?

You're a responsibility hoarder.

BRN Yeah.

I am working on it.

HUGH Your friends, your crew,

the future of every living thing
in the galaxy, literally.

Even when
you're struggling yourself.

ADI I'm sorry, I just don't
get why you're going with me.

You know less about me than
I do, and that's saying a lot.

BRN A year ago, you woke up
with no memories

and I woke up with no past,
and ten seconds

after I crashlanded
out of the wormhole, I puked.

ADI Okay, that's not exactly
a confidence booster.

BRN I bet.

ADI Okay, um, look, maybe
I should just go by myself.

BRN If you're good.
ADI Oh, yeah, I'm good.

BRN Okay.

COMP Attention, all crew.

Rotation assignments have ben
posted and are...

BRN Look, Dr. Culber's
a pretty smart guy.

I've trusted him with my life,
and I'd do it again.

And he thinks
I should escort you.

ADI Well, I like him.

So... you can come.

But, um, two things.

BRN Wait. So you're saying
you trust Dr. Culber

because you like him,
not because he's a doctor?

ADI Okay, look, I have a squid,
and you threw up in a wormhole.

Things are pretty weird
out here,

but human connection is
at least one thing I understand.

BRN Okay. Shoot.

ADI Whatever happens out there,

I don't want to let anyone down.

BRN You won't.

What's the second thing?

ADI Oh, uh, don't say anything
annoyingly inspirational.

That makes me nuts.

BRN Deal.

COMP Shuttlecraft Three, you are
cleared for safety check.

HUGH As requested,
I've completed my analysis,

and all crew members
are physically sound.

SAR You did not say "healthy."

HUGH Correct.

SAR Well, but?

HUGH Stress hormone levels
are off the charts.

If they were mice in a cage,

they'd be gnawing
at their own tails.

So would you, by the way.

SAR My tail and I appreciate
your concern, Doctor.

However, I need to know
how I can help this crew.

Perhaps a focus
on duties or routine?

HUGH Under any other circumstances,
those things might be helpful,

but...
we're in uncharted territory,

and they know it.

Discovery could disappear
tomorrow,

and it wouldn't make a ripple.

No one would miss us
or mourn us.

They need to feel connected.

SAR Yes.

VOS Welcome to Trill.

Uh, may I present Guardian Xi
of our spiritual community

and Leader Pav.

BRN Thank you.

I'm Commander Michael Burnham,

and this is Adira.

VOS Your captain said that you'd be
bringing a symbiont and host.

BRN Yes.

VOS She is...

...human?

ADI Yeah.

XI Uh, she is.

Please...

speak your names.

ADI Um...

Adira.

XI Continue?

That's it.
That's my name... Adira.

XI You recall no other names?

ADI Well...

I... I know Senna Tal,
I guess.

BRN She's unable to access
the memories of her symbiont.

That's why we've come.

VOS In 2,000 years,
there hasn't been a single

recorded instance
of a successful

joining between a symbiont
and a non Trill species.

It's a miracle
this symbiont is still alive.

ADI Well, I wouldn't let it die.

Uh, it's a part of me.

VOS It's a part of you?

She has no idea. None.

BRN Why don't you give us an idea?

VOS She's an abomination.

They must be separated
immediately.

XI We cannot. Forced separation
could kill the host.

BRN Oh, no.

No one is forcing anything.

VOS We are not Federation members.

You have no jurisdiction here.

Trill law takes precedence.

BRN Adira's life takes precedence.

XI Our apologies.

Every Trill longs to be a host.

Few ever receive the honor.

The Burn decimated
our population,

particularly
those capable of joining.

We no longer have
enough viable hosts.

Adira could be our future.

If we could finally
look beyond the Trill...

VOS Absolutely not.
Let us take Adira

to the Caves of Mak'ala,

where her symbiont might be able
to communicate.

VOS She will contaminate
a sacred space!

 The symbiont is not hers.
PAV Enough.

We've never forced a separation.

We will not start now.

However,

I agree that the joining
is an aberration.

BRN From what I'm hearing,
this joining is a miracle.

Maybe the symbiont
made the choice.

The memories that she's carrying

can help heal
the entire Federation.

And Senna Tal wanted us
to receive his message.

PAV The longer she stays,
the greater the challenge

to the only thing
our species have left...

Our ideals.

My decision is final.

You will leave Trill
immediately.

ADI So, that's it?

They're just kicking us off
their planet?

BRN Don't say anything else.

This isn't the way
to our shuttlecraft.

VOS The symbiont belongs with us.

BRN It is a part of her.

It is not your choice.

VOS I'm making it my choice.

BRN Where are the caves?

VOS Never.

BRN Fine.

ADI Um, that...

That wasn't Federation protocol.

BRN No, it wasn't.

They'll be fine.
ADI Michael?

XI Wait. Please.

Our society is on the brink
of collapse.

Helping you gives us
a fighting chance.

The caves are this way.

COMP The crew would benefit

from exercise, medication,
limited dairy.

SSAR Oh, uh,
beyond the standard parameters.

COMP Yoga, hyperbaric chamber,

therapeutic coloring books,
interstellar shopping.

SAR Uh, I do not need
an endless list of activities.

I... I need something
meaningful to heal my crew.

Computer?

COMP Hello.

SAR Hello.

COMP Among many sentient beings,

laughter is both healing
and meaningful.

Twentiethcentury Earth
comedians such as Buster Keatn

or Charlie Chaplin
are communal unifiers

without the burden of language.

SAR Buster Keaton?

COMP Also known as
"The Great Stone Face."

SAR Computer...

run a level ten diagnostic.

COMP I'm fully operational,
thank you.

SAR These connections are beyond
the algorithm I presumed...

COMP Your crew requires
what they used to call

R and R, Captain.

May I suggest switching
the ship to autonavigation

and giving them the night off?

SAR The night off?

COMP May I also suggest
simple gratitude?

A private meal, perhaps,
with your bridge crew,

to demonstrate
your appreciation.

Your choice, Captain.

XI The Sacred Caves of Mak'ala.

BRN This is incredible.

And you believe that Adira's
symbiont would be able

to communicate with her here?

XI It's their ancestral home.

If not here, then where?

ADI It feels...

safe.

XI We don't have much time.
Vos will awaken,

and the commission will see
that your ship is still here.

BRN Okay, are you ready?

ADI Say something inspirational.

Just don't make it annoying.

BRN Uh, get in there
before someone shoots us?

ADI Okay.

SAR Friends, please, come in.
Come in.

Uh, sit, please.

I gave the rest of the crew
the evening off to recuperate.

But I asked all of you here

because we work most closely

and have not had a moment.

In fact,
we have lost quite a few.

Almost every culture
has a ritual

that gathers its moments
when it can,

holds them dear.

A time to take the measure
of loved ones

and what we have all
accomplished together.

GRG Ah.

Hmm.

SAR We made a choice

a millennium ago

to follow Commander Burnham.

I will never forget what I heard

as I stood before each of you
as you cast your vote.

It was not unlike...

a small prayer.

I ask that we repeat that now.

GRG Must we really?
SAR Yes, we must.

Lieutenant Detmer,

do you remember what you said?

DET I said "Aye."
OWO I said, "Aye."
HUGH Aye.
LINUS Aye.
RHYS Aye. 
BRY Aye.
NAHN Aye, sir. 
TLY Aye. 
STA Aye.
NIL Aye.
GRG I never said "Aye."
But... I'm here.

SAR Aye.

ALL Aye.

BRN Is there any way the symbiont
was joined with Adira

against her will?

XI A symbiont can't thrive
in an unwilling host.

BRN So the issue might be
with Adira herself.

XI A repressed memory
related to the joining, perhaps.

Whatever it is,
she will need to face it.

ADI It's not exactly my style.

XI Please... enter.

This is as new to us
as it is to you.

We cannot know how your brain
will process what you see.

The Mynh'ta Orb
will allow us to track

her isoboromine levels.

As long as they are steady,
she is safe.

BRN If you find Senna Tal
down there...

...his message is pretty vital.

ADI I know.

BRN Good luck, Adira.

XI She is now in communion.

LINUS Is that droogbeetle pie?

Mmm.

HUGH What is going on
between you two?

STA I don't know.

Nothing.

SAR This reminds me of harvest
on Kaminar.

Siranna and I would work
from sunup

until after sunfall, gathering

and drying
our seasonal kelp crops.

Our family would then

dine together
under the full moon.

GRG Kelp dries in the sun.

An existential crisis.

Is there some dessert?

HUGH Is that a haiku?

GRG Yes.

HUGH Emperor Georgiou.

Feasting on the finest cuts.

Snarfs cookies on the downlow.

I screwed up the last line.

SAR No matter. Hear! Hear!

NAHN Haiku?
TLY Oh.
I puked upon...
DET No. No.

TLY ...the Tellarite ambassador

once at Thanksgiving.

RHYS Yeah.

TLY It was
an actual diplomatic crisis.

OWO Okay, this is not what I want
to hear at dinner. I mean,

 who raised you people?
TLY Get Detmer to do one.

DET No. No, I don't want to...
OWO Come on.

Try. Try.
DET No.

Okay.

The drones
can't get Stamets' blood

off the medbay floor...

No. Wait.

No one can clean
Stamets' blood...

Okay, I've got it. I've got it.

No one can get Stamets' blood...

Oh, shoot. No, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

Stamets' blood

is so red.

SAR Lieutenant.
DET No, I've got it now.
I've got it.

It's five, seven, five, right?
SAR I don't think this is...

DET It's a poem.
STA It's uncalled for.

SAR Officers.
STA My life is not a joke
for the dinner table.

DET I wasn't trying to make a joke.

STA I was back at work

within a few hours
of being injured.

We wouldn't have gotten anywhere
near Earth if it weren't for me.

DET You're not the only one
to move this ship.

I'm the pilot.

We move it.

STA I never said it was just me.
DET You think

you're the only essential
personnel on this vessel.

Look at you.
It's written all over you.

SAR Lieutenant.
DET You want to fly
this monster?

Actually be responsible
for every single person

every single day,
or do you just want to be

the when he feels like it
superhero

and have everybody
kiss your ass?

STA The reality is I'm the only one
who can make the jumps.

DET I flew us into the future.

I landed this ship.

I landed Discovery.
STA Yes, and we barely survived.
TLY Oh, my God.

Stop it! You guys are both
acting like complete assholes.

SAR Ensign Tilly.
HUGH Why don't we all
just take a breath?

TLY You guys think you have
the market cornered on pain?

All of our sacrifices,

all of our experiences

and our work, it matters.

The only way we're gonna

get through this is as a crew.

STA I have work to do.

OWO You did land this monster.

He should be thanking you.

Keyla. Keyla?

SAR Uh...

GRG Well, at least
the wine was good.

PART THREE 

BRN Her levels are dropping.

I need to get her out.

XI Stop!

PAV Guardian Xi.

You have betrayed your oath.

BRN He's trying to save your lives.

 What's happening?
XI I don't know.

I've never seen anything
like this.

BRN I have to help her!
VOS You cannot enter.

XI This girl is all we have!

BRN Please, we can't
let her die in there.

PAV Let her in.

BRN She's gone. Where is she?

XI Help me
with the neural stabilizers.

These will help you
commune with her...

but only for a short time.

You have to go and find her
and guide her out.

Hurry, please.

Now.

BRN Adira?

Adira, can you hear me?

Adira?

Adira?

ADI Michael?

BRN Ah!
ADI Michael!

Did he tell you how
to get out of here?

Because there's no way out,
and I don't know

what I'm supposed to do.

BRN Okay, what have you seen so far?

ADI Watch it!

BRN What are those?
ADI I don't know. They do that

if I stay in one place
for too long.

BRN Okay.

ADI It's happening.
BRN Have they done that before?

ADI Yeah, the threads are
everywhere.

They keep coming after me.

BRN Let me try something.
ADI Ow! What the hell?!

BRN This place is responding to you.

You're here to connect
with the symbiont.

And these threads...

they're trying to connect
with you.

ADI I don't understand. I...

BRN It's the symbiont.

It...it wants you to remember.
And these threads,

they...they must be connected
to your memories.

I know you're afraid,
but you have to let them

connect with you.

ADI Okay.

COMP Surgery bay 12,
prepping symbiont transfer

to Trill host.

GRY Hold my hand.

ADI When this is all over,

after you and the symbiont
have joined,

will you still be you?

GRY Of course I'll still be me.

I will always be the Gray
you know and love.

ADI I love you, Gray.

Gray.

That...That's his name.

He was my boyfriend.

Uh, we were together
on a, uh, a ship.

Um...

A generation ship.

It was trying to find
Federation headquarters.

Gray. We...we both...

We were both orphans.

But we had each other.

I really loved him.

BRN Good. What else do you remember?

ADI He was... He was Trill.

Um...

H...He was, uh, a host,

and I think
he was about to receive

his symbiont.

He looked so happy.

BRN Okay, why aren't you?

ADI I don't know, I don't, um...

I'm sorry, I... I just...

I...I need...
I need to get out of here.

BRN You can't.

Not until
you finish remembering.

So, how long were you together?
You and Gray?

Try...

Try to see his face.

GRY You don't like my playing?

ADI No, I... do.

You said you'd be the same
after you became a host,

and all these things
you can do now,

it's kind of like
you're perfect.

GRY Well, I already was
perfect. That's why you love me.

ADI Okay.

GRY I told you.

I'm still me.

I'm just... more me.

ADI Which parts?

Like, what's you and what's...
all the other hosts?

GRY There aren't any fences.

I'm many, and I'm one.

Like everyone.

ADI I feel like I need to keep up.

GRY You're being a crazy person.
It's...it's not a race.

ADI I don't think I could ever do
what you did.

GRY Bullshit.
The joining's based on trust.

I didn't just have to accept
Tal, Tal had to accept me.

The former hosts
had to accept me, too.

Like us.

I'd trust you with my life.

ADI Me, too.

GRY Gonna show me what's in that box
on your lap?

Or keep sulking?
ADI Um...

This is, uh, a thing

that I made... for you.

GRY You made it?
It's not replicated?

"Oh, I'm Adira, and I struggle

"with my own inadequacies
while I'm making amazing

art things that no one
in the galaxy can make."

ADI How do you know
it's an art thing?

GRY Because we have
a love thing, idiot.

And I know you.

ADI No, I...I need to get out of here.

BRN Adira...
ADI Don't touch me.

Okay, the only reason

you're here is to get
that message from Senna Tal.

So do not pretend like
you are doing this for me.

BRN This is for you.
It's for all of us.

We all want a future
that's real.

That matters.

If you don't face what this is,

no matter how painful,

you'll never move forward.

BRN Adira!

Adira?

Adira. Open the box now!

Open the box!

PART FOUR 

ADI I read that in a lot of
cultures on a lot of worlds,

stories are woven into
tapestries and quilts.

A piece might be a reminder

of someplace special or a moment

or a person they really loved.

See, um, this is the time
we broke the replicator

and it wouldn't stop
making apples.

GRY Oh, this is from the time
that we played imaginary chess.

ADI Mmhmm.

GRY This is our story?

ADI Yeah.

It's a special time for you,
and it should be marked.

I wanted you to have something.

GRY I love it.

And you're an art genius.

ADI No.
GRY Say it.

ADI Okay, I'm an art genius.

COMP Structural breach
force fields engaged.

All personnel to the evacuation
shuttle immediately.

Emergency drones dispatched.
GRY Oh! Oh.

ADI H...Help!

Medical!

Somebody help, please!

Medical, now!

Shh.

MEDICAL DRONE Life signs failing.

ADI No, you have to help him.

MEDICAL DRONE Subject will not survive
treatment protocols.

GRY Their lives.

All their memories will be lost.

MEDICAL DRONE Symbiont is stable and will
survive immediate transplant

to suitable host.

ADI I'll...I'll take them.

GRY What?

ADI Just...just let me take them.

Okay? The memories,
the symbiont.

I...I know I'm not Trill,
but I'll keep them safe.

GRY You would do that?

ADI You have to ask?

MEDICAL DRONE Prepare for transfer.

ADI Just hold my hand, okay?
Hold my hand.

BRN You did it.

It's okay.

GRY I missed you.

ADI I missed you so much.

SEN Tal accepted

each of us.

Joining made us more
than we could ever be alone.

And while a human joining
is unusual,

Tal accepts you, as well.

ADI You're...

You're Senna Tal.

SEN Welcome to the circle.

BRN Thank you, sir.

Your message gave me hope.

ADI It's time for us to go.

XI Please,

speak your names.

ADI I am Kasha Tal.

Jovar Tal.

Madela Tal.

Cara Tal.

Senna Tal.

Gray Tal.

And I am Adira Tal.
ALL *speaking Trill*
VOS Our deepest apologies,
Adira Tal.

We were wrong.

PAV Guardian Xi,
what you have done here

will impact generations
of Trill to come.

Adira Tal,

it would be my honor

to guide and mentor you
on your new path.

ADI Thank you.

But I believe I'm supposed
to stay with Discovery.

The symbionts are a gift for
everyone, not just the Trill.

And I think I'm supposed
to be that messenger.

PAV You will keep us apprised
of your wellbeing?

ADI Of course.

PAV And perhaps someday,
when the Federation returns,

we will discuss
a different joining.

BRN It would be our honor.

TLY Thank you for doing this, sir.

I know it didn't go
the way that you hoped.

SAR Captain Pike made
connecting with the crew

seem so... effortless.

TLY For what it's worth, uh,
this was, like, a Tuesday

at my house growing up, so...

Sir...

...we made a decision together,

and we are living with it
together.

The fact that
you reminded us of that

and reminded us who we are
to each other, that...

Maybe this isn't my place
to say, but...

I think that's leadership.

SAR Thank you, Ensign.

STA Captain.

Tilly, um...

Everything that I've done
since I've been on this ship

would have been impossible
without you.

I've failed
to let you know that.

TLY I always knew it.

STA I failed to tell you.

I apologize.

TLY Thank you. Thank you.

STA Uh, I've been wondering,

what did you learn
in your spore drive research?

TLY Oh, nothing. I was...

looking at dark matter
and energy coefficients,

but the math didn't work, so...

STA A new interface using dark
matter would be revolutionary.

We should keep talking about it.

TLY Okay.

DET Hey.

HUGH Are you okay?

DET No. Obviously.

That was hard for me to admit.

HUGH For anyone.

And you're a pilot.

Pilots are, um...

DET Macho.
HUGH Hmm.

DET I know.

HUGH Hmm.

DET That talk that you suggested,

maybe I could take you up on it?

HUGH Anytime.

COMP All available crew,

please report
to shuttle bay for a surprise.

HUGH Hmm.

GRG Yeah, okay.

SAR It fills the room.

HUGH Joy?

Yeah.

We all had to stop pretending
we were fine first.

SAR We are not, are we?

HUGH How could we be?

But we'll get there.

And you pushed us closer.

SAR Yeah. It was not pretty.

HUGH It never is.
SAR Hmm.

HUGH Good choice, Captain.

SAR No. I wish I could
take credit, Doctor.

HUGH This wasn't you?

SAR Mmmm.

I have a theory.

The sphere data was transmitted
here for us to protect it.

It lives on within Discovery.

As we are now
inextricably connected,

perhaps now it desires
to protect us.

ADI Senna knew the algorithm we need
to find Federation headquarters.

I already did the math.

BRN These coordinates...

ADI They'll take you
where you need to go.

BRN Thank you.

That's beautiful.

What is it?

ADI It's, um, a lullaby.

I think Senna Tal's parents

used to sing it to him
when he was a kid.

All the hosts, their memories
are still coming to me.

BRN I expect it'll take a while.

GRY Your bowing could use some work.

ADI If you're gonna insult
my musical ability

for the rest of my life...

GRY You didn't tell her about me.

ADI I'm not sure she'll believe me.

GRY Pretty sure she will.

ADI How are you here?

GRY I...I don't know.

ADI How is this supposed to work?

GRY I don't know.

But like I said,

our bowing,
we can do better than that.

ADI Well, we'll keep practicing.

THE END
