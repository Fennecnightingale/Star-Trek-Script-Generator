PART ONE

GAB X-ray analysis
and GRB emission confirm

the supernova's imminent.

Now harnessing the energy for
time crystal test nine beta.

Charge is at 70% and rising.

With any luck, we should be able

to make our first jump
very soon.

BRN (CHILD) Mom, dinner!

Did you know a star
goes supernova

every second in the universe?

And it releases more energy
in a few seconds

than our sun will
in ten billion years?

BRN DAD I didn't.

BRN Will Alpha Lupi
go supernova soon?

Three days feels like forever.

GAB The universe has its
own way of telling time,

baby girl.

BRN You were almost late for dinner.

BRN DAD Oh, we'll forgive her.

GAB Very generous.

BRN DAD Is the crystal stable?

How'd your calculations
turn out?

GAB I'll have more than enough
energy for initial trials.

BRN DAD Then we should celebrate. Yes, we should.

Michael's so fascinated
by the supernova.

Peas in a pod.

GAB I'm done for, by
the time she's 12.

BRN DAD You and me both.

Come to the table, baby.

BRN Uh, Mom?

There's a new light in the sky.

GAB It's probably just
a meteor, honey.

BRN But it looks like it's landing.

BRN DAD Go, go, go!

Hide Michael, and
secure the lab!

I'll buy us some time! Go!

BRN Dad!

GAB I need you to be brave.

Stay in here,
don't make a sound.

It's gonna be okay.

BRN Mommy?

GAB I love you, baby girl.

HUGH Hey, hey. You're okay.

You're safe.

Welcome back, Commander.

You were dead from toxic
asphyxiation for over a minute,

and you received a high dose
of tachyon radiation.

That'll give anyone a headache.

BRN How long was I out?

GRG Five hours.

BRN The Red Angel.

I thought I saw my...

It was me, though, right?

The bio-neural signature...
HUGH There are, um,

significant
biological similarities

between, uh,

mothers and daughters.

Particularly
the mitochondrial DNA.

BRN What?

That was real?

GRG Yes, Michael.

It's your mother.

BRN No.

No, she died.

She died.

She-she died.

I heard...

And Leland, he...

She...

Where? I mean, where-where is...

PKE She's being cared for
down on Essof IV.

HUGH Easy, easy.

It's not safe for you
to beam down.

Not until the effects of
radiation poisoning dissipate.

BRN I... I can't sit here.

HUGH Your mom's unconscious

but safe within
the containment field.

BRN Okay. How is this possible?

PKE You must have
a million questions. 
BRN How could she survive?

Is my dad alive, too?
PKE I'm asking you

to be patient, Michael.

BRN My mom has been dead
since I was ten,

you're telling me
she's actually alive.

How can you expect me
to be patient?

SPK You woke...

sooner than expected.

BRN What did you find?
SPK And I see

you are yourself again.

Commander Stamets finished

scanning
the Angel's exoskeleton.

It contains a data module
with hundreds of mission logs,

which Ensign Tilly
was able to download.

I believe these will be
of interest.

BRN How many entries?

SPK 841.

PKE You're the one to assess.

See if you can find any answers

while we wait
for your mother to wake up.

HOLO BURNHAM The room is sealed.

No one will hear you.

LEL You're Control.

HOLO BURNHAM  I am, in holographic form,

indistinguishable
from any biological entity

I might choose to represent.

LEL And how long do you think
that will last?

They figured out
Admiral Patar wasn't real.

HOLO BURNHAM There are 7,000 active ships
in Starfleet,

all reliant
on the chain of command.

That chain is
unquestioned, unbroken,

unseen.

Every instruction,
passed down through channels.

In time,
even those who would not

follow my agenda
knowingly... will.

LEL What am I doing here?

CTRL When I eliminated Admiral Patar,

it was easier
to simulate a Vulcan.

Airiam's augmentation
allowed me a similar facade.

But flesh is a different matter.

There is an element of human
nuance I have not yet mastered.

I require a face and a body

that will allow me
more freedom to operate.

Your face. Your self.

LEL Never.

I am my own man.

CTRL A man who has demonstrated
with his every action

a willingness to operate

from several different truths
simultaneously.

It has allowed you to make
questionable moral decisions

while avoiding the destructive
power of human guilt.

You believe in the ends
more than the means.

That pattern of behavior

is useful to me.

Struggle... is pointless.

LEL You won't win.

CTRL You joined Section 31
to keep a brutish universe

on its knees, Captain.

To maintain order
by any means necessary.

Your evolution... our evolution...

Is not a desecration
of that oath

but its very fulfillment.

BRN Mommy.

GAB We'll be okay,
I know what to do.

I can get us out of here
before they even arrive.

I'm jumping back just an hour.

Three, two, one!

950 years?

Where the hell am I?

Mission log 009.

Mike, Michael, I keep trying
to get back to you,

but I can never manage to stay.

Mission log 027...

Mission log 039...

Mission log 042.

No matter how many times
I go back in time,

I can't stay anywhere
permanently.

The anchor keeps pulling me
back, 950 years away from you.

There are no signs
of life anywhere.

Antimatter detonation
across the galaxy

indicates Control
wiped everything out.

Vulcan, Andoria, Tellar Prime,
Deneva, Earth.

This is Earth.

As far as I scan, everywhere.

I'm alone.

TLY Captain, I'm registering
gravimetric instability

in the planetoid.

PKE Normal or abnormal occurrence?

TLY Uh, definitely abnormal.

It is centered directly

on our research facility.

PKE Mr. Saru, can you pinpoint
a possible cause?

SAR I believe, Captain,

this is a classic example
of Newton's third law of motion.

TLY How every action has
an equal and opposite reaction.

Sorry, it's just my
second favorite law

of physics.
Uh, my first is, uh...

TLY We know that
both Dr. Burnham

and her suit are tethered
to a point in the future.

Our containment field
is holding her in the present.

The tighter we hold,
the stronger time pulls back.

PKE In other words, we're playing
tug-of-war with the universe.

SAR Eventually, we will lose.

STA We have a gravitational problem
on Essof IV.

I need power...

PKE Already on it, Commander.

Divert all nonessential ship's
power to the surface.

Give Commander Stamets
whatever he needs.

OWO Yes, Captain. - 
PKE How long before
the universe wins?

SAR Perhaps... an hour.
Two at the most.

PKE Commander, get down there

and see what you can do.

Lieutenant Bryce,
tell Dr. Culber

we're running out of time,
we need to wake up our patient.

BRY Aye, Captain.

PKE I need to talk to her
before we lose the chance.

PART TWO

CTRL LEL Our mission parameters
have changed.

We set the trap assuming

Michael Burnham
was the Red Angel.

That turn of events
has altered our agenda.

ASH How?

CTRL LEL I saw Dr. Gabrielle Burnham's
corpse

on Doctari Alpha
with my own eyes.

ASH What, you're saying this woman
isn't Gabrielle Burnham?

CTRL LEL I'm saying the woman
I saw is dead.

We have no credible way
of knowing

who or what or what that woman
down there really is.

A clone, some sort of unknown

genetic replica...

GRG Maybe you simply don't like

the fact that Admiral Cornwell

placed her entirely
under Discovery's purview.

CTRL LEL I don't need to remind you
that, if Control downloads

the Sphere data embedded
in that ship's computer,

it will achieve consciousness,

and that is how this all starts.

What if she was sent

to take the data
back to Control?

ASH Or she came here to stop
Control from ever getting it.

CTRL LEL I know you both have feelings
for Michael Burnham.

But we cannot afford to confuse

what you believe
her motivations are

with whomever that is
lying there.

GRG If she is a Trojan horse...

Discovery's defenses would
prove woefully inadequate.

ASH I have faith
in Discovery's crew.

CTRL LEL Faith is not a strategy.

I understand this seems
like betrayal,

but we are the ones who need
to be holding that data.

I have created a secure area

within our data storage.

The Control module will never

be able to access it.

Get me that data, Tyler.

If Captain Pike

won't protect it...

then we must.

ASH You want me to commit espionage

against another Starfleet ship?

CTRL LEL That is the job we have chosen.

If your connection to Michael
is giving you pause,

I'll remind you that she is
being protected, too.

She is more vulnerable
than anyone.

Would you rather see
all sentient life

in the galaxy destroyed
because we failed to act?

GRG You're quite resolute today.

CTRL LEL The times call for it.

GAB I built myself a home base
on a class M planet

50,000 light-years away.

Wherever I jump,

the suit will always return me.

Right back here.

No preexisting technology,

so Control can't find me here.

I'm safe for now.

But Einstein couldn't
have been more right.

Time's motion depends
on the observer.

On the action.

The people I was able
to move from Earth

to Terralysium,
as they call my planet,

are thriving.

Their survival means
that time is fluid.

The future can be changed.

Maybe the past as well.

I have to believe
I'll see you again,

my sweet daughter.

Mission log 799.

No matter what I do,
I can't stop Control

from getting the Sphere data.

I've even tried
destroying the Sphere.

But it's impossible.

I taught my child
never to despair.

But if I can't change

this one thing...

The only thing
I can think of now...

is to...

undo its gravitational binding.

And put the Sphere
in Discovery's path.

In the hopes
that they'll find a way

to keep the data safe.

BRN The Sphere data came to us
because of you.

[DOORBELL CHIMES] 

Come in.

SPK I trust the mission logs

have proven valuable.

And perhaps difficult.

BRN Did you need something?

SPK Dr. Culber's about
to report from the surface.

I believe your mother
is regaining consciousness.

TLY Commander Stamets
reporting gravimetrics...

PKE To be continued, Ensign.

Mr. Bryce.

Put Dr. Culber
on-screen, please.

BRY Aye, Captain.

PKE Did you manage to wake her up?

HUGH Yes. Dr. Burnham has regained
consciousness.

Tachyon radiation levels
are beginning to normalize.

She's asking
to speak to you, sir.

BRN We'll be right down.

HUGH I'm sorry, Commander.

Dr. Burnham is asking
to speak with the captain.

And only the captain.

BRN She's my mother.

HUGH I'm sorry,
I'm just the messenger.

BRN There are so many questions

that need to be answered
right now.

Whatever her reasons are
for not wanting to see me,

I should be the one asking.

PKE I understand your position.

But I think we need to follow
Dr. Burnham's lead here.

SPK I must agree with the captain.

BRN I'm not asserting
my rights as a daughter.

That would be childish.

I am the one who knows her best.

HUGH But there may be other
variables to consider.

I mean, she's
experienced something

that no one else
in history ever has.

Look.

I've been reinstated
for all of five minutes,

and I did it because I
wanted to help, but...

you have to consider
the fact that the person

your mother was before she
stepped into that time suit...

may not be who she is now.

BRN Who better to
gauge that than me?

PKE I understand
your desire to see her,

but for now we do this her way.

We need to establish trust if
we're going to get any answers.

BRN Please.

PKE You're staying
on board, Commander.

I'm sorry.

You'll have to watch
from the feed.

NAHN Sir, you won't be able to enter

the containment field,
but you can

go right up to it.

STA It's taking more
and more energy to hold

Dr. Burnham
and the suit in place.

Sooner or later,
probably sooner,

our reserves will run out.

And she'll be pulled
into the future again.

PKE Then I'd better talk fast.

Dr. Burnham.
I'm Captain...

GAB Captain Christopher Pike.

USS Enterprise.

In temporary command
of Discovery.

But soon you'll return
to your ship.

I could say more
about your future,

but you won't like it.

PKE Well, we're,
uh, not here to talk about me.

GAB Then let's talk about the fact

that I came here
to save my daughter,

and you deceived me.

PKE Michael risked her life
to bring you here.

We understand the threat
to sentient life.

GAB You understand nothing.

As long as there's
any possibility

of Control gaining access
to the Sphere data,

everything will die.

Always.

I put that Sphere
in Discovery's path

so you could protect the data,

but even that didn't work.

You have to let me keep trying.

PKE Then let us help you
finish the mission.

Tell us what the signals mean.

GAB I don't know about any signals.

PKE  In the sky?
 Uh, seven simultaneously,

and then each one led us...

GAB I said I know nothing
about them.

You want to help?

Delete the Sphere archive.

Without that data, the
A.I. cannot evolve.

PKE We're protecting it.

GAB Don't you understand?

Time is a living thing.

It has gravity and will

and it's pulling
the A.I. closer.

I've seen it with my own eyes.

PKE And you believe
that deleting the archive...

will stop the A.I.
from evolving?

GAB Yes.

But if you miss something,

I'll have no choice
but to try again

and again and again.

You have to release me.

PKE I can't do that.

I'm sorry, Doctor.

GAB You're a ghost to me,
Captain Pike,

one of hundreds

of trillions that fill
a galactic graveyard.

So...

until you're willing
to do what I say,

exactly as I say,

this conversation is over.

SAR Deleting the Sphere archive

is tantamount to burning
the Library of Alexandria.

Or the Bibliotheca Corviniana.

This knowledge is invaluable.

Protecting it, safeguarding it,

is a central tenant
of the Federation

and our sworn duty
as Starfleet officers.

BRN Unless that knowledge poses
a clear and present danger

to all sentient life.

ASH From a security perspective,
I have to ask,

what if Dr. Burnham,

your mother, has an agenda
we're not aware of?

BRN The one thing that I witnessed

about my mother, over and over,

was her relentless
pursuit of facts.

So if she believes
that deleting the archive

will defeat the A.I., I have
no doubt that she's right.

PKE I agree with Burnham.

Deleting the archive
is our best option.

SAR I will proceed.
 
PKE What's happening?

SAR I do not know, Captain,
the system is not responding

as it should.

The data memory core is
partitioning itself.

Reconfiguring its
security directives

into a new language matrix.

ASH How can it do that?

BRN The intelligence is a remnant
of the Sphere itself.

When we first
encountered the Sphere,

its data was
determined to survive.

And it still is.

SAR The archive is
building firewalls

around itself
using xeno-encryption

taken from its own
historical language database.

PKE Can you work around it?
BRN He wouldn't be able to.

He needs a linguistic key.

The encryption is based on a
language from a civilization

that hasn't existed
for a thousand centuries.

SAR It seems, Captain,

the archive will not allow
itself to be destroyed.

PKE Keep trying, Mr. Saru.

We cannot allow
that data to survive.

PART THREE 

GAB Mission log 271.

Spock can understand me.

I jumped back into his childhood

and warned him about Michael
dying in the forest.

I haven't been able
to communicate with anyone else.

Spock's Vulcan logic training
in human emotions

seem to give him
the psychological balance

to comprehend my existence.

And his dyslexia
allows him to process

the effects
of atemporal dysplasia.

In all of time...

Spock may be the only person
who can help me.

BRN L'tak terai.

Dyslexia.

SPK I spent my entire childhood
attempting to conceal

my human failings
from those around me.

BRN It was never a failing.

It was precisely what allows you

to process those visions
of the future.

You helped Discovery chart
a new course.

One that brought
my mother back to me.

One that may very well

enable us to save the future.

SPK I was wrong to judge you...

as unfit to process
your own emotions.

It was...

Petty.

Unmerited.

I can only imagine
what you must be feeling.

BRN I need to see my mother, Spock.

SPK You have questions,

beyond the scope of our
mission, that deserve answers.

Let us speak to the captain.
Together.

CTRL LEL The Red Angel is awake.
It's only a matter of time

before she... it, whatever
it is... tries to take that data.

You are the only one
standing between survival

and obliteration.

Is that in any way vague?

ASH When they tried to delete
the Sphere data,

it protected itself.

This is more complicated
than I thought.

CTRL LEL I find that hard to believe.

ASH Find it however you want.

I'm not going to do this.

It doesn't feel right to me.

Is that in any way vague?

CTRL LEL No. You made the right call.

Stay on that ship
and keep me in the loop.

Good work, Mr. Tyler.

PKE Because of how little time
we have, I'm obligated

to let you try this.

BRN Either she knows more about the
signals than she understands,

or her lack of knowledge
suggests they may have been

created by the
A.I. itself,

maybe to mislead or confuse us.

SPK Or there is a third variable
we have yet to realize.

BRN Which makes this conversation
all the more pressing.

SPK "Time is out of joint.

O cursed spite, that I was
born to set it right."

BRN Hamlet.

Hell yeah.

Energize.

GAB No.

No.

BRN This is like a dream.

GAB Did you delete the archive?

Did you destroy it?

BRN We couldn't.

But we're finding a solution.

GAB I knew it.

This is why I told
him to let me go.

BRN Hey, hey.

Please.

It's been 20 years.

Talk to me.

Is Dad...?
GAB Stop.

People think time is fragile.

Precious. Beautiful.

Sand in an hourglass, all that.

But it's not.

Time is savage.
It always wins.

So this... is meaningless.

BRN No, this matters.

You and me, here.

Now matters.

GAB I know you're asking yourself

how, after,
after all these years

of wishing for a mother,

you could, you could
give her up,

now that she's
finally reappeared?

How could I?

Easy.

Neither of us has a choice.

So you want to have
this conversation one day,

the right way?

Get me out of here.

I need to try again
to alter the timeline.

BRN You reached out to Dad and me
through space and time.

You never gave up on us.

Why are you giving up on me now?

GAB Haven't you learned anything
from those failures?

My God!
The stubbornness!

BRN Where do you think
I got it from, Mom?

It's what kept you going
when you thought

you were all alone
in the universe.

You were going to get back
to your family.

To me.

I am standing right here.

Right now.

GAB I don't know what
you've been telling yourself

all these years, but I let you
go a long time ago.

I had to.

I've seen you die
a hundred times.

And I'll see you die
a hundred more.

That is my life and my prison.

I can't hope anymore.

BRN I don't believe you.

GAB There's only
the bigger picture now.

Nothing else.

BRN How much longer until
the containment field fails?

STA 43 minutes. We've increased
power to the field,

but the gravitational pull
on Dr. Burnham and the suit

is also increasing.

ASH We could give you guys
more power.

Would that make a difference?

STA I'm channeling my inner Isaac
Newton, and I'm sorry to say,

it wouldn't, equal and opposite
reactions being what they are.

SPK Dr. Burnham has been focused
on trying to destroy the Sphere.

Perhaps there is a reason
she has thus far failed.

PKE You think we're going about this
the wrong way?

SPK Fourth century Earth philosopher
Lao Tze said,

"Water is the softest thing,
yet it can penetrate mountains."

An illustrative truth.
What appears immutable

is not: a mountain,
the Sphere, time.

In this case,
I wonder if time itself

may provide the answer.
BRN Instead of fighting time, we go with it.

Stop trying
to destroy the Sphere,

and merge it right
into the river of time itself.

ASH You mean send it
so far into the future

it can't do us any harm?

STA I collected sensor data
from Dr. Burnham

when she first arrived.

The Red Angel suit has

almost limitless quantum
computational power.

Literally infinite storage.
PKE Meaning...

you can transfer the Sphere
archive into the suit,

program a destination beyond
Dr. Burnham's anchor point

and let the wormhole
take it forever?

STA Perpetual infinity.

Control will never get the
data in order to evolve.

BRN But my mother is connected to
the future, just like the suit.

What happens to her?
STA To sever your mother

from her space-time requires
the energy equivalent of...

a supernova.

But we do have another...

massive source of exotic energy.

BRN The dark matter particles.
STA We may be able

to modify a transporter enhancer
with dark matter.

SPK Yes, to pierce
the timestream long enough

to lock on Dr. Burnham and
beam her into our space-time.

Permanently.

I like science.

CTRL LEL They would send the suit
into the future

and allow Dr. Burnham to remain.

We cannot allow that.

GRG Dr. Burnham.

You're truly threatened by her.

CTRL LEL And why aren't you?

You've always held
a superior note

because you exist in
two different universes.

This woman exists across time.

She's seen how you've
lived, how you'll die.

She... is the
definition of power

you once were.
GRG Get to the point.

CTRL LEL Shoot all of that data into the future
in hopes that nothing will find it

poses an unacceptable risk
to the larger mission.

GRG Mm. Interesting turn of phrase.

CTRL LEL A mission you should
understand in your bones.

GRG You want her gone.

CTRL LEL Yes, and so do you.

There is nothing she
hasn't witnessed.

There is nothing
she does not have,

including Burnham's devotion.

She has supplanted
you, Commander,

and she will supplant you
in every incarnation.

GRG And Tyler?

CTRL LEL He has limits.

You do not.

GRG Let me guess.

If I place this
near the Angel suit,

we can steal Discovery's
data transfer

without their knowledge.

And once the download
is complete,

this amplifier
will self-destruct,

destroying the time suit

and Dr. Burnham.

CTRL LEL As a Terran...

you should be able
to see the logic.

GRG And if she is
who she claims to be...

CTRL LEL Then you are still

only the second most powerful
woman in the universe.

Is that who you want to be?

Contact me

once you've placed the device,
so I can begin the upload.

GAB What are you doing, Christopher?

Michael, what are they planning?

GRG They're transferring
the Sphere data to your suit.

Which they will then send
into the future.

They think that's the way
to protect us all.

GAB Are you here to kill me,
Philippa?

GRG Would I tell you

if that were the case?

No.

I just want to talk
to you privately

and see up close

the woman Michael has mourned
for 20 years.

GAB I've seen you sacrifice
yourself for her,

surrendering your own life
without a moment's hesitation.

I thank you for that.

GRG You have obviously confused me

with my sentimental
prime-universe counterpart.
GRG I'm Terran.

Self-sacrifice is not our way.

GAB I know exactly who you are

and what you're capable of.

GRG I doubt I would sacrifice
my life to save the galaxy.

GAB You'd be surprised

what you'd do for
the people you love.

GRG Quite the feat of engineering:

simple,

elegant,

yet incredibly powerful.

The suit is DNA-strand encoded.

GAB It won't operate
for just anyone,

in case you were thinking
of taking it for a spin.

GRG I get my thrills in other ways.

But time travel must be

an elixir of some kind.

Intoxicating enough

to make one forget
about domestic matters.

A child, perhaps?

GAB Your mother
didn't teach you how to look

but not touch, I see.
GRG My mother taught me

many different things
in our universe.

Above all,

she taught me to survive.

CTRL LEL We're at five percent.

Six percent.

Seven percent.

ASH Is that...?

CTRL LEL Sphere data. Yes.

Monitor it for me.

We leave orbit the
moment it's complete.

PART FOUR 

GRG So we've met.

GAB Most people say "I'm
pleased we've met."

GRG Most people are predictable.

GAB Philippa, I want your
word on something,

mother to mother.

GRG I rarely make promises.

GAB That's why I'm asking you.

You love her.

Promise me
you'll take care of her.

GRG Perhaps you'll find a way
to look after her yourself.

GAB Not as long as the A.I. exists.

It considers me
an unacceptable risk

to the larger mission.

CTRL LEL It poses

an unacceptable risk
to the larger mission.

BRN I wondered why we lost our feed.

GRG Technology can be so unreliable.

Have fun with...
whatever that is.

GAB When were you planning

to tell me you were
downloading the Sphere data

into my suit? 
BRN It's a radical idea,
I know, but...

GAB It's a brilliant plan.
I'll be able to safeguard

the archive in perpetuity now.
BRN No, Mom.

You won't have
to give up your life.

We modified the transporters

to beam you permanently
into the present.

We'll send the suit
into a future

where Control
can never reach you.

GAB No.

If your plan fails,
Control wins.

There'll be no one there
to stop it.

We can't take that risk.

BRN This will not fail.

I need you to hear me:

I am not losing you again.

ASH Why are you contacting me
on a secure channel?

GRG How much data has been
transferred to our ship?

ASH 22%.

This is about Leland, isn't it?

GRG What I'm about to tell you

is the first real test
of our relationship, Mr. Tyler.

Betray me,

and I'll live long enough
to hunt you down

and kill you slowly. Understood?

ASH I've been killed
before, Georgiou.

You're just telling me I'll have
time to enjoy the scenery.

STA I've retrofitted these pattern
enhancers with dark matter.

That should provide enough
energy to beam Dr. Burnham

out of her native
space-time into ours.

But we only have

enough power for one attempt.

So, theoretically,
this should work.

BRN It will work.

STA Then we shut off
the containment field

and let the suit
take the data away forever.

GAB Time's not on our side, Michael.

BRN Mom, whether you like it or not,
I'm gonna save you from this.

Mostly I'm gonna save you
from yourself.

GAB I remember the white dress
you wore the day you graduated.

BRN How could you know?

GAB I watched you

when you first beamed
aboard the Shenzhou

with Sarek.

When you finally learned
the Vulcan salute

from Spock as a child.

When you were alone and crying

because all the other Vulcan
children had rejected you.

I was there when you
read Alice in Wonderland

out loud to yourself
on your 11th birthday,

pretending to read
it to your father

and to me.

I heard you, baby. I heard you.

And when that creature
came for you on Vulcan,

I was there.

I have been there through all
those moments and so many more.

Seeing you gave me
strength and resolve.

Seeing you reminded me
of what I was fighting to save.

I have been fighting
for you, Michael.

To get back here to you.

But I can't come home now,
honey.

Not yet.

Not until this thing
is gone forever.

BRN Oh, Mom...

ASH You did it.

The data transfer's stopped.

GRG Good.

Now go find out what Leland does
in the dark.

ASH Say please.

You won't win.

CTRL LEL Leland said the same thing.

TLY Commander Stamets is ready, sir.

PKE Prepare to transport...
BRY Captain.

Priority message
from the Section 31 ship.

PKE On-screen.

ASH Leland.

It's too late.

OWO I can beam them now, Captain.

PKE They're Dr. Burnham's
only defense.

SPK Captain, we have a problem.

PKE It'll have to wait.
Dr. Culber, Dr. Pollard,

stand by for incoming wounded.
SPK Sorry, Captain, this cannot wait.

The Section 31 ship
is diverting our data transfer.

How much Sphere data
SPK have they downloaded?

37% thus far.

TLY Captain, gravity is
fluctuating wildly.

The field can't
hold much longer.

GAB He's taking the Sphere data.

Drop the containment field.
I'll go back and stop him.

BRN We're not going to do that.

GAB No!
BRN Mom, stay down.

GAB Michael!

STA Come on, I got you, I got you.

Come on, over... come here.

SAR Captain, we cannot stop
the data transfer.

PKE How much data
has he downloaded now?

SPK 45%. 46.

The transfer speed
is increasing.

BRN Can we still pull my mom
into our timestream?

STA He destroyed the
control station.

GAB You need to destroy
the containment field.

Without the suit,
he cannot take the data.

BRN If we do that,
you get yanked back.

And then you don't have

a suit to navigate
the timestream.

STA He'll kill her, Michael.

At least this way
she would have a chance.

SPK The transfer's being controlled

by something
within the facility.

PKE Come up with another solution.

We haven't come this far
to lose everything now.

STA If we each shoot
one of the discs,

the power disruption
will release

the containment field.

GAB You have to let me go, Michael.

It's the only way each of
us has a chance to survive.

BRN I'll find you, Mom.

It'll be okay.

I love you.

GAB I love you, too, baby girl.

BRN Ready.

Now.

Burnham to Discovery.

Four to beam up.

Then blow this place to hell.

OWO Landing party on board, Captain.
PKE Fire torpedoes.

RHYS Aye, sir. Firing torpedoes.

Direct hit, sir.

The Essof facility
has been destroyed.

OWO Captain.

I detected a transporter signal
from the surface

to the Section 31 ship.

PKE Damn it.
Lock on a pursuit course.

DET They've masked their
warp signature, sir.

There's no way to pursue.

OWO Captain, I've picked up
a distress beacon

from an escape pod.
One life sign.

Identified as Ash Tyler.

GAB When the timestorm passes,

I'll come back for you,
baby girl.

For you and your father.

I promise.

SPK Leland received 54%
of the Sphere data.

Significant,

but as the captain has stated,
we will continue the fight.

BRN She was right.

What fight are we supposed
to be continuing, Spock?

Everything we try fails.

Now, with no suit...

no time crystal...

it'll always be
one step ahead of us.

SPK Respectfully,
Dr. Burnham was incorrect.

Now does matter.

What happened before
no longer exists.

What will happen next
has not yet been written.

We have only now.

That is our greatest advantage.

What we do now
here in this moment

has the power to
determine the future.

Instinct and logic together.

That is how we will defeat
Control in the battle to come.

We will find a way.

All of history can change
with our next move.

The board is yours, Michael.

THE END
