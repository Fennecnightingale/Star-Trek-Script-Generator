PART ONE

SAR It is almost inconceivable

to have you back
with us, Dr. Culber.

HUGH Inconceivable, yeah.
There isnt a test or a, a scan
Dr. Pollard hasnt run on me.

SAR Well, you appear yourself.

HUGH Well, I dont feel
like myself.

SAR Enduring something no
one thought possible

can be transformative.

Perhaps,

perhaps, in feeling
less like you were,

you are more like who
you were meant to become.

POL Commander Saru?

Your results.

The most evident anatomical
change from the Kelpien advent

of your

Vahar...

SAR Vaharai.

POL Thank you.

With the loss of
your threat ganglia,

the cartilage that housed it
is reorganizing to accommodate

a new type of
keratin-based tissue.

It looks like spikes
growing in like teeth.

Does that sound right?

SAR I would not know.

Did you discover anything that
might affect me psychologically?

POL These are your neurotransmitter
expression patterns,

last year versus today.

With you as
my only Kelpien specimen--

forgive the term--
its difficult to say

with certainty
what these changes mean.

But if I had to guess,

Id say your fear responses
are being repressed.

SAR What is a Kelpien without fear?

I am losing the very thing
that defines me.

I am stumbling in the dark.

And yet I cannot help but feel

that somewhere
within the unknown,

there is purpose.

And that we are being
guided toward it.

ASH Its Section 31s position

that if the entity
were calling the Red Angel

is in fact generating
these signals,

its also capable
of time incursions.

And should be
considered dangerous.

PKE So far, these signals
have led the

Discovery

on two rescue missions.

ASH Or two catastrophic events.

Does the Angel merely appear
at these crisis points,

or is it creating them?

We have to consider
both options.

PKE So lets consider.

The Red Angel appeared on Earth
and transported people

to Terralysium
only moments before

they would have died
in a nuclear blast.

It also guided Spock
to rescue me when I was

a child on Vulcan.

ASH Ive seen the drawings

from Spocks time
in the psychiatric unit.

Look, can either of you
say for sure

this thing didnt cause
his nervous breakdown?

PKE Spock made no mention
of the Red Angel

when he asked for leave
from the

Enterprise.

BRN But Agent Tylers
correct, Captain.

With so few data points,
it is impossible

to draw conclusions based
on its nature and motivations.

We need more
information.

PKE What we need is Spock.

ASH Captain Leland
has devoted significant

Section 31 resources
to finding him.

But were coming up
empty-handed.

As his sister,
can you think of anywhere

Spock might have gone?

Someplace we might not
have thought to look?

SAR (over comm):
Captain,

you are needed on the bridge.

PKE What is it?

SAR We have detected a new signal.

PKE Where is it this time?

SAR Outside of Federation space.

Ah.

OWO Acquiring coordinates.

PKE On screen.

OWO We have a lock, sir.

The signal is over
an M-class planet.

Its listed in the
Federation database as...

SAR Kaminar.

Commander Saru, thats...

Yes.

Kaminar is my homeworld.

Kaminar is populated
by two sentient species:

my people-- the Kelpiens--
and the Baul.

BRN The Baul are your predators.

The Baul achieved warp
capability 20 years ago.

The USS

Archimedes

made
first contact with them

after receiving
a transmission from Kaminar.

But once communication
was established,

the Baul High Council
proved hostile.
ASH So why did the Baul send

a transmission
in the first place?

SAR They...

did not.

That transmission was from me.

I coopted
the Bauls technology

in order to send a message,
with the hope

that someone, somewhere,
would receive it.

BRN And that someone
was Captain Georgiou.

SAR She was a lieutenant then,

serving on the

Archimedes.

Were it not for her,
I would have been unable

to flee Kaminar
or be granted asylum.

I promised never to return.

That was the price of knowledge.

PKE And now,
of the billions of planets

in our galaxy, the
signal just happens

to show up above the homeworld
of my first officer.

What are the odds?

BRN It certainly isnt random.

PKE Discoverys

taken a serious
interest in the Red Angel.

Could be
its returning the favor.
ASH  Thats a leap.
Commander Saru,

are there angels
of any sort in Kelpien culture?

SAR Kelpiens believe only
in the Great Balance,

which, if upset, would devastate

the fragile ecosystem
of our planet.

And we are taught that the Baul
are the keepers of this balance.

PKE Do the Kelpiens worship
the Baul?

SAR It is their superior technology,
of which Kelpiens live in awe,

that allows the Baul mastery
over my people.

They hide behind it.

No Kelpien has even seen
a Baul in living memory.

BRN It is the same technology

they use to keep
Starfleet at arms length.

PKE So we shouldnt expect
a warm welcome.

BRN The Baul are, by nature,
isolationist.

And theyre committed
to preserving

the status quo on Kaminar.

ASH  Well, they must have seen

the signal, too.

BRN Maybe they wouldnt mind an
offer to share information.

Depending on
how theyre approached.

PKE Well, lets knock on the front
door and see if they answer.

ASH And then what? Just ask nicely?

PKE Well, as unexpected guests,
it never hurts to be polite.

(indistinct chatter)
PKE Prepare to disengage
warp power.

DET Sir, stopping out of
warp above Kaminar.

The signal disappeared

before we arrived.

PART TWO 

PKE What else is new?

Mr. Bryce, hail the Baul
on all channels.

Commander Burnham, run planetary
and full-spectrum scans

on anything resembling
our elusive angel.

And any power source capable
of generating these signals.
BRY The Baul are not
responding, sir.

OWO Thats not entirely true, sir.

Theyre scanning
our weapons systems.

Just our weapons systems.

ASH So much for knocking
on the front door.

PKE Maybe the Baul just

havent learned the importance
of a good first impression.

Burnham?

BRN I see no indication
the Red Angel was here.

Or any immediate danger
to the planet.

PKE Then why are we here? Anybody?

ASH Youre assuming the signals
only appear for a reason.

PKE Yes, Mr. Tyler, thats
exactly what Im assuming.

Why wont the Baul respond?

SAR Perhaps,

as I have said, it is
because they are oppressors.

And even had the Baul
answered our hails,

why would you trust those
who have enslaved my people

for centuries
with fear and lies?
PKE Your insights
are invaluable,

Mr. Saru.

But the signal appeared here.

And maybe the Red Angel, too.

If you have any idea how I could
make inquiries without...

SAR There is a Kelpien priest
in every village.

Priests not only serve
as intermediaries

between us and the Baul,
but they also connect

all of our extended
communities together.

PKE So if the Red Angel
appeared on Kaminar,

then a priest might be able
to tell us about it.

ASH Wouldnt that be a violation
of General Order 1?

BRN Though the Kelpiens

arent warp capable, theyve
seen warp-capable technology

through the Baul,

and they know about spaceflight.

First contact with the Kelpiens
by Starfleet

is a judgment call,

but our mission
to investigate these signals

would seem to require it.

PKE We can stretch
General Order 1,

but lets try not to break it
in the process.

Burnham,

as a xenoanthropologist,

I think youre
uniquely qualified

to talk
to a village priest.

SAR Sir,

I am the logical choice.

I offer my experience.

To disregard it
is to disregard the suffering

of generations of Kelpiens.

PKE Given all that suffering,

youre the most
complicated choice.

SAR Do you doubt my ability
to carry out the mission?

PKE Of course not.

But at present, we lack
a full understanding

of the biological...

and behavioral changes
youre undergoing.

SAR I can assure you, Captain,
I am still very much myself.

PKE I can only imagine the pressure
you might feel to share

the truth with your people
about

Vaharai.

SAR Are you suggesting
that I might be incapable

of following Starfleet
regulations?

Or that I would
disobey your orders?

BRN Captain.

Kelpiens have no knowledge
of Starfleet

or any other
inhabited worlds.

Even though General Order 1
allows contact,

my arrival could come as
a complete shock to them.

Commander Saru would be
invaluable to have by my side.

PKE All right.

But Ill remind you both, were
here to gather information

about the signals
and the Red Angel,

not start a war between
the Kelpiens and the Baul.

Mr. Saru?

SAR My duty, first and foremost,
is to

Discoverys

mission, sir.

PKE I never doubt that.

Start in your
own village.

Maybe theyll be
glad to see you.
HUGH So, uh,

what did the scan say?

POL Read em yourself.
HUGH All normal.

STA Youre you.

POL Yes and no.

Brain patterns and neural
impulses are identical,

but this body

was entirely reconstituted
from your DNA.

Its brand-new down to the
last molecule. You are,

for lack of a better word,
pristine.

HUGH My scar, its gone.

STA It is?

I hadnt noticed that.

POL What scar?

STA Oh, the scar
he chose to keep.

You never told her
the story?

He was hiking the cliffs
of Cabo Rojo, alone.

HUGH I was 16...

STA And apparently indestructible.

The path he
was on gave way,

and he fell 30 meters.

HUGH 15, actually.

STA Well, enough to puncture
your shoulder.

He wouldve bled out, too,

if it werent for a
certain Dr. Kashkooli,

who was half a
kilometer behind him.

She risked her own life
to climb down and help him.

She stitched his wound up
with a fishing line.

Gave him a very

sexy scar

and inspired him to go
to medical school

and become the man he is today.

It is weird not
seeing it on you.

HUGH So, um...

...i-if my senses feel
a little off, its...

POL Its because your new nervous
system is still adjusting.

Id like to continue
monitoring you, but I believe

youre ready to resume
your normal life soon.

(animals chittering)

BRN That pylon.

It isnt Kelpien,
is it?

SAR No.

The Baul have erected one
in each village to observe us.

It has earned them a fitting
name among my people:

the Watchful Eye.

BRN This pylon is connected
to an incredibly vast network.

Must have taken
the Baul generations

to integrate their
technology and ideology

into Kelpien society.

SAR Our two species have become
so intertwined that,

outside their
technology,

it is difficult to
discern what is purely us

and what is distinctly them.

BRN Where is everyone?

SAR The days work is done.

It will soon be nightfall.

Kelpiens rarely venture
out in the dark.

(sighs)

I led this life once.

BRN If I didnt know
your people were oppressed,

Id think Kaminar
was a paradise.

SAR Well, in many ways, it is.

We live in harmony
with each other,

in a world without
hunger or poverty.

The only violence we
know is the culling,

which Kelpiens have
been misled to accept

as a mercy
by the Baul.

And our priests
sustain that belief.

BRN Didnt you say
your father was a priest?

SAR Yes, he was
a collaborator,

albeit an
unwitting one,

enforcing the grip
the Baul had on my people.

BRN Saru...

SAR For 18 years,

I dreamt of returning
to my village.

It has not changed at all.

But I see it...

quite differently now.

(beeping)

(whirring)

BRN These are the same flowers
from your quarters.

SAR Fredalia, yes.

They do not grow quite
so well on a starship.

SIR Brother?

SAR Siranna!

Saru!

Youre alive.

Oh, but how?

We thought
you were dead.

Taken by the Watchful Eye
for questions

you should not
have asked.

Oh...

Where have you been
all this time?

SAR Siranna, 18 years ago,

I thought I could find
my future in the stars,

and I did. Uh...

(gasps)
I was welcomed

by an interstellar service
called Starfleet,

committed to peace and the
exploration of our galaxy.

An organization far more
powerful than the Baul.

I found a new life.

SIR What are you?

BRN Im human. My name is Michael.

I come from a planet
called Earth,

and I work with your brother
on the starship

Discovery.

SIR How is it that we can
understand one another?

BRN This device.

Its able to translate
over a thousand languages.

SIR You mean to say there are
a thousand life-forms out there?

SAR Oh, not just a thousand--
hundreds of thousands.

SIR So different and yet...

The galaxy?

Space travel?

Do humans from Earth drink tea?

(chuckles)

PART THREE

SAR Oh, how I have missed
the fredalia tea of home.

SIR We were blessed with
a bountiful harvest this year.

SAR Oh, you sound
just like Father.

Where is he?

SIR Father reached his

Vaharai
and joined the Great Balance

not long after you... left us.

How could you?

And never even let us know
that you were still alive?

SAR I thought it would be safer
for you to believe I was dead.

SIR Safer?

We believed you had outraged
the Watchful Eye.

We spent years in agony,
fearing retribution.

I dreamed of our
reunion, brother.

SAR I could not be
more sorry, Siranna.

SIR This is a longer conversation.

But I sense that is not
the reason you are here.

SAR I...

BRN Were looking for an entity

that we call
the Red Angel.

We have reason to believe that
it appeared here on Kaminar.

SIR Is it another life-form?

BRN We do not yet know what it is,
only that it appears

in conjunction with a red burst
of light in the sky

and in places
of crisis.

SIR The fiery sign... I saw it.

BRN Have you seen or heard anything
that might be this Red Angel?

Maybe from
the priests

in the other
villages?

SIR This is why you have returned?

I should have known
you did not come back for me.

SAR Siranna,
I ask you to...

SIR You ran away because you were

not brave enough to face the
Balance as the rest of us do.

(rumbling)

(deep bellowing)

BRN Whats happening?

SAR The Baul.

SIR They must have observed
your return.

Once again you disturb
the Great Balance

and put our village in danger.

You must leave now!

We wont be safe
until youre gone.

SAR Siranna, this might be the last
time we ever see each other.

SIR Return to the stars, Saru.
There is no place for you here.

(deep bellowing)
SAR Theyre coming.

BRN Discovery,

beam us back.

(deep bellowing)

(panting)

(computer chimes)

COMP Yellow alert.

Commander Saru,
Commander Burnham,

please report to the bridge.

COM Whatever you did,
the Baul are hailing us now.

PKE Im going to guess its not
to invite us to a welcome party.

BRY Communication channel
established.

Its audio-only.

PKE Mr. Saru, I think
it would be best

if you stay out
of this conversation.

This is Captain Christopher Pike
of the USS

Discovery...

BAUL You have taken
what belongs to us.

PKE What have we taken, exactly?

BAUL A Kelpien.

Starfleet promised

that it would not meddle in the
internal affairs of our planet.

PKE Were investigating the signal
that appeared over your planet,

which Im sure
you noticed.

These signals are typically
followed by the arrival

of an entity we call
the Red Angel.

Are you familiar
with it?

The Red Angel may pose a threat
to Kaminars Great Balance.

Our mutual interest
lies only

in keeping the peace,
which we all...

BAUL No one is safer
than under the Watchful Eye.

Return the Kelpien to us,

and we will allow you
to leave without harm.

SAR I am not yours to be returned!

PKE Mr. Saru.

SAR I am brother

to Siranna, who lives
a life of oppression.

I am son of Aradar,

who died needlessly
at your hands.

BAUL The Kelpien speaks.

SAR I am Commander Saru,

the first and only Kelpien
to join Starfleet,

and I know the truth
about

Vaharai.

BAUL The Great Balance is
the only truth,

and it must not be disturbed.

SAR Your lies no longer work on me.

I survived
myVaharai

and I know that
it means not death

but evolution, an evolution you
murder my people to suppress.

PKE Commander...

BAUL You think you know everything,
Kelpien,

but you do not even know
what you are.

DET Captain, I detect

ten Baul sentry ships
on an intercept course.

PKE Shields up. Red alert.
Show me what were dealing with.

(alarms blaring)

RHYS Baul ships are powering up
their weapons.

PKE Warm up the phasers.
RHYS Aye, Captain.

PKE Whoever is listening
to my voice,

I advise that you consider

your next move very carefully.

BAUL Give us the Kelpien.

PKE Commander Saru is a
political asylum seeker

and a Starfleet officer,

protected by the Federation.

BAUL You would risk the lives
of your own people

for one Kelpien?

PKE This Kelpien

is

our people.

And to defend him, I will do
whatever I deem necessary.

As will we.

BRN The Baul are activating
the pylon

in Commander
Sarus village.

BAUL You have interfered

in the affairs of this village.

If you do not return
the Kelpien,

therell be blood on your hands.

SAR The pylons are weaponized.

They mean to destroy my village.

We have to...

PKE Mr. Saru!

You will remove yourself
from the bridge.

SAR But, Captain...

PKE Thats an order.

(sighs)

(panting)

COMP Red alert.

All crew
to their assigned stations.

(indistinct chatter)

SAR You are relieved from duty.

CREWMAN Sir?
SAR Get out.

BRN Saru, I know what youre doing.

Move off the transporter pad
now.

(phaser powers up)

SAR Or what, Michael?

BRN I dont want to use this.

But youre not
thinking clearly, Saru.

SAR I have never felt more clarity
than in this moment.

This is the only way.

Would you not do the same
for your own brother?

OWO Sir, someone is beaming down
to planet surface.

PKE What? Who is it?

BRN Burnham to the bridge.
Its Commander Saru.

Hes surrendering himself.

PKE Damn it.

RHYS Captain, the sentry ships are
powering down their weapons.

PKE Ops, track Sarus signal.

OWO A Baul ship has taken him.

Theyre traveling toward...
Ive lost the signal, sir.

Hes gone.

BRN Well, with 100,000 years worth
of data,

there has to be some information
about Kaminar

in the Spheres archive.

TLY Well, what precisely
are we looking for?

BRN When the Baul
learned that Saru

had survived his

Vaharai,

their determination
to capture him increased.

It was as if his continued
existence threatened them.

TLY You think the Baul
are hiding something?

BRN I think they know
more about the changes

brought on by

Vaharai
than the Kelpiens do.

And I think
theyre willing to do

almost anything
to keep that secret.

TLY Will they kill Saru?

BRN Not if we can find out
what theyre hiding in time.

And there has to be something
in the Spheres archive.

There has to be.

TLY Well, thats what
Airiam and I are here for.

We will find it.

ARIM There it is.

When I said "we,"
I just meant Airiam.

The Sphere did collect
readings from Kaminar.

Thousands of years worth
of statistical measurements.

TLY Transfer it over
to this station, please.

(exhales)

BRN And when Saru challenged
the Baul, they said,

"You do not even know
what you are."

So, what is Saru?

(gasping)

(panting)

SAR Siranna?!

SIR Brother?

Oh, why did
the Watchful Eye take me?

It is not yet my time.

SAR My sister has nothing
to do with this!

I am the one you wanted.

SIR Why did you have to return?

Everyone else
thought you were dead.

But the night you disappeared,

I saw the light
rising into the sky.

I became a priest
to seek that light.

To seek you.

Your face is beautiful to me,

but part of me hoped
I would never see it again.

Because it might mean
you were free.

(whirring)

(whimpering)

(yells)

SIR No! No.

(grunting)

Stop!

(distorted cries)

(whimpering)

(snarling)

(gasps)

(growling)

(gasps)

(shrieks)

PART FOUR

BRN Fascinating.

Airiam, can you identify

historical biological records
from Kaminars surface?

ARIM Searching...

Yes, bio-signs were archived
by the Sphere.

TLY Um, actually, I can use those
current readings of the Baul

to distinguish their bio-signs
from the Kelpiens.

BRN Right, and we can
cross-reference

Sarus medical records

to isolate
the

post-Vaharai

Kelpiens

historic bio-signs
from the rest of their species.

The Baul could
only know about

the evolutionary
consequences of

Vaharai

if, at one time, they
experienced them.

Otherwise, why does it
threaten them?

TLY Well, if we, uh,
go back 2,300 years, uh,

theres a significant portion
of the Kelpiens were like Saru.

BRN They survived

Vaharai?

TLY The blue represents
evolved Kelpiens,

green unevolved, red Baul.

Sorry, that...

that doesnt look right.

BRN The Baul narrowly escaped
extinction.

TLY Then they turned around

and wiped out the
evolved Kelpiens.

Leaving only unevolved Kelpiens,
but...

Wait, so all this
would mean that...

BRN The Baul were originally
the prey species.

TLY So they would think
of Saru as a...

BRN Predator.

(grunting)

(groaning)

(gasping)

BAUL The first Kelpien

to pass its

Vaharai

in over 2,000 years,

and your primal, feral responses

are the same as centuries ago.

Your kind can never govern
itself.

The Federation has no idea

what they have welcomed
into their ranks.

SAR They gave me the chance
stolen by the Baul.

BAUL Your species does not deserve
a second chance.

The Great Balance
is the only way to ensure

you do not destroy
everything in your path.

SAR The Great Balance is a lie

you created
to defend yourselves from us,

and to absolve yourselves
of murder.

In truth, you are frail.

You would be helpless
without your technology.

BAUL We will never allow
the past to be repeated.

No threat to the Great Balance
will go unanswered.

SAR You cannot maintain
what you think of as peace

by continuing to cull us.

Kelpiens are more
than our instincts.

BAUL You are the only two Kelpiens
to know the truth.

You will undergo analysis
and be neutralized.

The truth will be contained.

SAR Wait!

(groaning)

SIR No, please, stop!

SAR Siranna!

(grunting)

(panting)

SIR It is true, then.

You have survived

Vaharai?

SAR Yes.
(gasps)

I am what we
used to become.

The form we were meant to take.

SIR The Great Balance...

our sacrifice
to the Watchful Eye...

It was all a lie.

SAR Forced upon us by the Baul.

SIR That stole our mother and father
from us.

And generations of Kelpiens,
beyond reckoning.

SAR And it must end.

BRN The Baul used their
technological advantage

to lock the Kelpiens
into subservience,

allowing them to live

while eliminating the threat
they posed.

PKE And thats why
the Baul are afraid.

Well, if we can
help them understand

that Saru is not a threat,

that his people
need not be a threat...

BRY Sir, were receiving a hail...

from the Baul.

BRN We should accept it.

(static crackling)

SAR Discovery,
this is Commander Saru.

Its good to hear your voice,
Commander.

I am with Siranna,
inside a Baul structure.

But we have no
other indicators

of our position.

We cant seem to get a lock
on your coordinates either.

Your location must be shielded
from our sensors.

PKE Have you come in contact
with the Baul?

SAR Yes. It was...

enlightening.

BRN Commander Saru,

we used the
Spheres archives

to analyze your
planets history,

and its far more complex
than we thought.

All evidence indicates that

Kelpiens, in

post-Vaharai

form,

were once the Bauls predators.

SAR That confirms
my suspicions.

And the Bauls
belief that,

after passing

Vaharai,

my people can
only be predators.

They will do anything
to continue the culling.

And to keep more Kelpiens
from learning the truth.

SIR It will not be easy
to convince my people

the Great Balance
is a deception,

but we must find
a way to save them.

BRN Thousands of years
of conditioning

will take time to undo.

SAR But Siranna is right.

We must demonstrate to Kelpiens

and Baul alike
what we could become.

The same way I was shown.

TLY The Sphere.

The Sphere triggered
your

Vaharai.

SAR Yes, but we need to
accelerate the process.

We cannot allow the Baul

to take action before

Vaharai
is complete for all Kelpiens.

BRN If we isolate
the active frequencies

in the Spheres transmission,
the corresponding sound wave

should speed up
the biological response, right?

TLY I got it.

SAR And the Baul
will have no choice

but to face our evolved race.

PKE What if history repeats itself?

We cant be responsible for the
extinction of the Baul species.

BRN But the Baul are still vastly
technologically superior.

BRN It would take the
Kelpiens generations

to become a serious threat.

SAR Generations during which
the Baul could face

the thing they fear
most about us.

Not our so-called
baser instincts.

Our rage.

But we will prove to them
that we can move beyond it.

We will not perpetuate
the cycle.

We will create

a new balance.

Captain, I cannot prove it,

but I believe this is what the
signal brought us here to do.

PKE Very well, Commander.

Discovery

will help you
amplify the signal.

BRN How will we broadcast
the Spheres transmission

to all the Kelpiens at once?

SAR The same way I made
first contact

with Captain Georgiou.

By using the Bauls own
technology against them.

TLY That should do the trick.

Commander Saru,
Im sending you the modified

Sphere transmissions now.

SAR Once I do this,

all Kelpiens, including
you, will begin

Vaharai.

Everything will change.

Im afraid itll be
much more painful,

like being torn
apart from within.

SIR Just promise me, brother,

that this will not be
the end of our people.

SAR No. It will be a new beginning.

SIR Then let it begin.

(grunts)

(energy surging)

(high-pitched whining)

(pained cries)

(screaming)

BRN Bio-sign readings
indicate that

Vaharai

has initiated in 63%
of Kelpiens and rising.

(screaming)

(gasping)

SAR Im sorry.
It will be over soon.

(pained gasp)

(rumbling)

OWO Sir, Im detecting
massive activity

beneath the surface of the lake.

PKE On screen.

OWO Theres a structure
rising above the water.

At least 50 kilometers
in diameter.

(thunderous rumbling)

(alarm beeping)

PKE A Baul stronghold.

RHYS Protected by a powerful
force field.

BRN That might be where
theyre holding

Commander Saru and Siranna
captive.

PKE Red alert. Rhys, target
that structures shields.

If we destroy them,
maybe we can get a lock on Saru

and his sisters location.

(breathing normalizing)

SAR You have survived.

(deep bellowing)

(whirring)

SIR We have angered the Baul.

(alarm sounding)

PKE Owosekun, tell me
what Im looking at.

OWO That Baul structure is
activating pylons

across the planet,

with an energy buildup
capable of destroying

every Kelpien village.

BRN Rather than let
them evolve,

the Baul are
committing genocide?

PKE Bryce, hail these bastards.

Rhys, forget the stronghold.
Get a target lock

on those pylons.

BRY Theyre not responding, sir.

PKE Open a channel.

This is Captain Pike.
I will not allow you

to wipe out an entire race.

Your fear of the Kelpiens
has blinded you

to a peaceful solution.

Starfleet can help you
negotiate a new balance

between your two species,

protecting everyone
on your world.

However, if you choose

to murder the entire
Kelpien population...

...you will become our enemies.

Choose wisely.

DET Sir, theyve activated
all 4,056 pylons

in every Kelpien village.

PKE Lieutenant Rhys?

RHYS There are too many pylons
to target at once, sir.

PKE Lets get started.

Arm photon torpedoes.

On my order.

(whirring)

SIR The Baul mean to kill us all!

SAR Discovery

will stop them.

SIR No, no!

(powering down)

OWO Sir, sensor readings
indicate

a massive spike in
electromagnetic radiation

in the Baul structure.

BRN The pulse has deactivated
all the pylons across Kaminar.

PKE Rhys, hold your fire.

RHYS What the hell
is happening?

BRN The Baul weapons and shields
have all been disabled,

but I cant get a reading
on what caused it.

DET The technology required
to generate

electric and magnetic fields
that wide...

This should be impossible.

(both breathing heavily)

SIR That is what you came to find.

A savior.

(chittering)

(indistinct chatter)

KELPIAN VILLAGER Siranna, what has happened?

How have we
survived

Vaharai?

SIR The truth has survived.

It is time for a true balance
to be restored.

(indistinct chatter)

You do not have to
be afraid anymore.

COM Attention, all personnel...

(continues indistinctly)

(door whooshes open)

(door whooshes shut)

ASH Whats this?

PKE Commander Sarus report,

shared in the spirit
of cooperation.

Thanks to Commander Sarus
enhanced eyesight,

he was able to get a better look
at the Red Angel.

ASH "The entity appears
to be a humanoid

"wearing a
mechanized suit,

"exhibiting technology
far beyond

present Federation
capabilities."

PIKE So, its

someone.

And whether human
or alien,

it has extremely
advanced technology.

ASH Someone who is manipulating
the fates of entire species.

Control,

which models Section 31s
threat assessments,

is probably rightfully
alarmed by...

what is it? A...

a time-traveling being
pursuing its own agenda?

PKE When we forced the Baul
to decentralize their power

across the entire planet,

the Red Angel took advantage
of their temporary exposure

and used its advanced technology

to save the Kelpiens
from genocide.

ASH And what happens
when that technology

is turned against us?

PKE Section 31...

and Controls
threat-assessment models...

seem a bit paranoid.

Youre aware were
no longer at war?

ASH And we dont want to
end up in one again.

This last war, sir, took a toll

on those who fought it.

Some of us are still torn apart.

SAR I felt the same way

the first time I saw it,

looking down on our
planet, our home.

Well, you took home
with you.

Well, seeds of it, yes.

This little garden was
all I had for so many years.

But I realized

there was so much
more out there.

You could come with me, Siranna,

if you wanted to see it.

Just for a while.

SIR No.

I must stay for my people.

There is a long road ahead,

Our minds must truly be free

before Kelpien and Baul
accept each other.

(clicks tongue)

But I am happy, brother.

I know you did not
leave Kaminar in fear,

but in hope.

And you brought that hope
back with you.

You and your Red Angel.

You are welcome
to return home

whenever you would like,
brother.

SAR I will, sister.

(gasps)

(sighs)

SAR Thank you, Michael.

Im reminded.
Do you know Aeschylus?

An ancient Greek tragedian,

born circa 525 BC.

"He who learns must suffer.

And even in our sleep..."

"Pain that cannot forget

falls drop by drop
upon the heart."

Knowing that my sister
has a chance to evolve,

to live a full life,

it makes me feel I
can endure anything.

I am sure, given
the opportunity,

you would do the same
for your own brother.

BRN If I could find him.

But seeing you with Siranna

has made one thing
very clear to me.

SAR And that is?

BRN I need to go home as well.

To Vulcan.
