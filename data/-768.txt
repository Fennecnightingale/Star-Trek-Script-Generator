ICHEB [screaming]
[squishing, crunching]
FEMALE DOCTORIOS Where's your cortical node, buddy?
FEMALE DOCTORIOS It's got to be in there somewhere.
ICHEB [screaming]
[low thud]
FEMALE DOCTORIOS Bjayzl?
ICHEB Seven?
SEVEN It's all right.
SEVEN You'll be all right.
ICHEB Go.
SEVEN No, not without you, Icheb.
SEVEN Then I'll s... I'll stay with you.
ICHEB N-Now, Seven.
ICHEB [wheezes softly]
ICHEB Please.
[whirring]
SEVEN I'm so sorry, my child.
SEVEN [Seven of Nine crying]
[indistinct chatter]
BJAYZL Ugh. What?
VUP Bruce Maddox.
BJAYZL Here?
VUP Indeed.
BJAYZL Huh.
BJAYZL How the mighty have fallen.
BJAYZL Kill him.
VUP [snarls]
BJAYZL Wait.
BJAYZL New plan.
BJAYZL Bruce.
BJAYZL This is so unexpected.
BJAYZL You've looked better.
MADDOX I've been in hiding.
MADDOX They destroyed my lab, Bjayzl.
BJAYZL Darling, I heard.
BJAYZL Have some tranya.
MADDOX [sighs]
MADDOX They used some kind of molecular solvent to destroy the entire facility.
MADDOX There was literally nothing left.
MADDOX They nearly got me.
MADDOX I'm so sorry, Bjayzl.
BJAYZL For what?
MADDOX I don't know how I'm ever gonna repay your loan.
BJAYZL Nonsense.
BJAYZL Who do you think did this, Bruce? Hmm?
VUP [snarling]
BJAYZL Who's after you?
MADDOX [whispering] I think it was the Tal Shiar.
BJAYZL Well, that does change things a bit.
MADDOX [gags]
MADDOX [coughs, gasps]
MADDOX [gasping]
MADDOX [grunts]
VUP [snarling]
BJAYZL Making a deal with the Tal Shiar is... always such a pain in the ass.
BJAYZL [sighs]
AI POLICEMAN Welcome to Freecloud.
AI POLICEMAN Whether you are here for the maximum-security financial and information services or the minimal restrictions on personal liberty...
[door chimes]
PICARD Come.
AI POLICEMAN Freecloud keeps your secrets.
PICARD You're well?
SEVEN I'm... functional.
PICARD Something to drink? Tea? Glass of wine?
SEVEN Bourbon. Straight up.
[canister clinks]
[bourbon pouring]
SEVEN This place is... something.
PICARD Not my idea.
SEVEN But you like it enough to keep it.
SEVEN What the hell are you doing out here, Picard?
SEVEN Besides being in way over your head?
PICARD I'm looking for someone.
PICARD Does that surprise you?
SEVEN I assumed it must be some kind of misguided diplomatic mission.
SEVEN Saving the galaxy?
PICARD There may be a bit of that, too.
SEVEN You're going to Freecloud.
PICARD You know Freecloud?
SEVEN I hate the place.
SEVEN But we... the Fenris Rangers... keep our money there.
SEVEN What little of it there is.
PICARD It's a tough time on Fenris, I hear.
SEVEN Does that make you happy?
PICARD I admire the Rangers' goals, their courage, their tenacity, but... you are taking the law into your own hands.
SEVEN What law?
PICARD Point taken.
PICARD Nevertheless, to appoint yourself judge and jury...
SEVEN I'm not here for a lecture.
SEVEN You think of me as a vigilante, fine.
SEVEN Ranging is my job.
SEVEN It's not saving the galaxy.
SEVEN It's helping people who have no one else to help them.
SEVEN It's hopeless and pointless and exhausting, and the only thing worse... would be giving up.
PICARD Mm.
SEVEN Freecloud works.
SEVEN You can drop me there.
SEVEN Who are you looking for?
PICARD Someone who has no one else to help her.
PICARD Someone who will likely die if I don't.
SEVEN I'll take another one of these.
RIOS She's in there with him.
RAFFI Huh?
RIOS The Ranger. She's in the chateau with Picard.
RAFFI Ooh.
RAFFI What do those two have to talk about, I wonder?
RIOS Seems like they know each other.
RAFFI No, I-I don't think so.
RAFFI Not back when I knew him, anyway.
RAFFI You know, she used to be Borg, like him.
RIOS Oh, wow.
RAFFI Mm-hmm.
RIOS She's that Ranger.
RIOS She's notorious.
RIOS Ninety-nine or Eleven or... Mm.
RAFFI Uh-uh.
RIOS Mm.
RAFFI She goes by Seven.
RIOS Seven.
RAFFI Mm-hmm.
RIOS The ex-Borg Fenris Ranger.
RAFFI I heard she's from the Delta Quadrant.
RIOS Seven, the ex-Borg Fenris Ranger from the Delta Quadrant.
RIOS And I somehow managed to forget that Picard used to be Borg, too.
RIOS Must have happily blocked it out.
RIOS [exhales]
RIOS This is some strange cargo you brought me this time, Raffi.
RAFFI Tell me about it.
JURATI Okay.
MADDOX Ah.
JURATI Okay, I don't get it.
JURATI You replicated the flour, the butter, the eggs, the sugar and the chocolate chips...
MADDOX Yes. And the baking soda.
JURATI Oops. Yes, baking soda. Right.
JURATI And then you set them all on fire...
MADDOX I do not set them on fire.
MADDOX I bake them. In my oven.
JURATI Oh.
MADDOX Ow. Still warm.
JURATI [laughs]
JURATI Now, why don't youjust replicate the cookies?
MADDOX Because I do not like the replicator's chocolate chip cookies.
MADDOX What can I say? There's an alchemy.
MADDOX Come here, Aggie.
MADDOX Taste it.
FEMALE VOICE La Sirena, this is Freecloud Orbital Control, confirming transfer of conn.
RIOS Roger that.
RED BOLIAN HOLOGRAM Welcome, Captain Rios.
RED BOLIAN HOLOGRAM I see your power conversion efficiency is only ninety-one percent.
RED BOLIAN HOLOGRAM Remember, nobody knows their way around the Kaplan F1SEVEN Speed Freighter like the Red Bolian.
VICTORIAN WOMAN HOLOGRAM Care for a cuppa? Join the party at the Freecloud Grand Hotel's afternoon high tea.
JURATI Help! Make it go away.
ROBOT HOLOGRAM The Freecloud Institute of Entertainment Robotics is now hiring...
RIOS You have to punch it.
ROBOT HOLOGRAM Submit your résumé today.
JURATI What?
RIOS Hit it as hard as you can.
JURATI I don't hit things.
RAFFI Oh, no, he's right, Doc.
RAFFI You need to knock its head clear off.
ROBOT HOLOGRAM Submit your résumé...
JURATI [grunts]
RIOS [chuckles]
JURATI [Jurati laughs]
RIOS Agnes for the knockout.
JURATI [grunts]
[both chuckle]
STONER HOLOGRAM Hey, lady, you looking to get snakebit?
STONER HOLOGRAM Slither in to Feely's Venom Garden and pick your poison.
STONER HOLOGRAM [groans]
PART TWO 
ELNOR I didn't get one.
RAFFI Uh, I found him, JL.
PICARD You found Maddox?
RAFFI Yes, but... Oh, my goodness.
RAFFI Bruce Maddox, what did you do?
RAFFI I'm on a jobs board for interfacers.
RAFFI Essentially, go-betweens for hire.
RAFFI Big business for competing corporations, rival criminal gangs, thieves and their victims, especially on Freecloud.
RAFFI I just sent myself an invitation to join the local 'facers guild.
RAFFI Old Starfleet intel trick.
PICARD Yeah.
RAFFI Okay. Party named Bjayzl is holding him.
RAFFI They're looking for someone to broker a deal with the...
RAFFI Tal Shiar.
SEVEN Bjayzl.
RAFFI You know him?
SEVEN Her.
SEVEN She butchers ex-Borg for parts.
SEVEN She's been high on the Rangers' wanted list for years.
JURATI Couldn't we outbid the Tal Shiar?
RAFFI No, not likely.
RAFFI If she's prudent enough to use a 'facer, this is probably a pretty substantial deal.
PICARD We must extract him.
RAFFI Uh, not with the security she's got.
RAFFI Occluded payrolls show she's got a little army of private contractors.
RAFFI And a Beta Annari.
RIOS [sighs]
JURATI What's a Beta Annari?
RIOS Sentient reptiloid.
RIOS Nasty pieces of work.
PICARD Without Maddox, we'll never find Dahj's sister.
PICARD Options?
RIOS Well, if we can't grab him and we can't buy him...
RAFFI Then we're shit out of luck, JL.
SEVEN Not quite.
SEVEN We trade.
SEVEN Give Bjayzl something she wants in exchange for Maddox.
SEVEN Something she'll find irresistible.
RIOS Like what?
SEVEN Like me.
[chatter, laughter]
RAFFI Okay, I dropped a pretty foolproof ID of you into the system.
RAFFI You are now a 'facer.
RAFFI Famous but not too famous.
RIOS "Pretty foolproof"?
RAFFI We're not exactly working with a whole lot of time here.
PICARD Raffi, are you serious, sending us down there looking like this?
RAFFI Well, 'facers tend to dress very flamboyant, JL.
RAFFI It's protective coloration.
RAFFI You're playing go-between.
RAFFI You want to stand out.
RAFFI You don't want anyone mixing you up with the other side.
RIOS What do you think, Agnes?
JURATI I think you're killing it.
ELNOR But are you really a... 'facer?
RIOS No.
RAFFI You're licensed, paid up on your guild dues.
RAFFI You have a meeting with Mr. Vup.
RIOS Mr. Vup.
RAFFI Yeah. Rios, you seriously, really need to sell this.
RAFFI You can't do your broody, existentialist spaceman routine.
RAFFI Your personality needs to match your clothes.
RAFFI You need to show a little panache.
SEVEN You need a feather in your hat.
[dance music playing]
RIOS A Temtibi Lagoon, if it's not too much bother.
RIOS And a game tablet.
RIOS With two umbrellas.
RIOS And if you can please let Mr. Vup know that I'm here.
RIOS The name is Rios.
BARTENDERIOS Mr. Vup knows.
VUP Feeling lucky, Mr. Rios?
VUP [snarls]
RAFFI Try to stay away from the lizard.
RAFFI Beta Annari can smell when you're not telling the truth.
JURATI Seriously?
RAFFI Well, also, what you had for dinner and the last person you had sex with.
RIOS If they're not the same thing.
JURATI Because that's not disturbing.
VUP I'm Mr. Vup.
RIOS Of course you are.
RIOS Salutations.
RIOS Please.
VUP [snarls]
VUP Let us not waste time.
VUP Your references are sound.
VUP Mr. Quark of Ferenginar was especially satisfied with your handling of his trouble with the Breen.
RIOS Yes, that was quite a foofaraw.
VUP Are you aware of the identity of the other party in this negotiation?
RIOS Indeed.
VUP Have you had dealings with the Tal Shiar before?
RIOS To be honest, I've tried hard to stay out of their way.
RIOS They are treacherous, violent, ruthless and subtle.
RIOS Their concept of honor is rooted in their skill at deceit.
VUP So why represent them now?
VUP [snarls]
RIOS Oh. [chuckles]
RIOS I'm not.
VUP [snarls]
RIOS I'm here on behalf of another interested party.
RIOS I've come to offer your employer alternative remuneration for Dr. Maddox.
VUP [snarls]
VUP Surprising.
VUP I'm not a fan of surprises.
RIOS I'm getting that sense.
VUP Now, what could possibly be worth reneging on a deal with the Romulan secret police?
RIOS I can explain.
VUP Maybe you aren't aware, Mr. Rios.
VUP We Beta Annari have 1,253 olfactory receptor genes, which means, among other things, I can smell a lie.
VUP [snarls]
VUP So, Mr. Rios, proceed with caution.
RIOS Ay!
JURATI Sorry. Sorry.
RIOS What the hell?
RAFFI Beta-blockers, anxiolytics, benzos.
RAFFI Delayed release.
RAFFI Raffi's home cooking, honey.
ELNOR Why would you do that? Just in case you do run into one of those hypersensitive reptiloids.
RAFFI Should kick in right about when you need it.
VUPICARD That many implants in a living specimen.
VUP Impossible.
RIOS How do I smell?
VUP [grunts, sniffs]
VUP Truthful.
VUP You also had some sort of smoked meat for breakfast, didn't you?
VUP So many intact and functioning Borg parts in a single specimen.
VUP She would be extremely valuable.
RIOS If you will indulge me with the smallest of transporter windows.
VUP [snarls]
RAFFI Honestly, Rios isn't the one I'm really worried about here.
RAFFI I'm more concerned with you two.
PICARD Oh. I thought that I looked...
PICARD [cartoonish French accent] ...appropriately sinister.
RAFFI Mm. No comment.
RAFFI Assuming Rios doesn't choke or mess everything up somehow...
RIOS Which he will not.
RAFFI This is a transport pattern enhancer.
RAFFI Once you get it inside their shields, it will create a stable tunnel to transport in and out of.
RAFFI They won't be able to differentiate it from your implants on the scan.
RAFFI Um, hands, please.
RAFFI No offense.
SEVEN None taken.
RAFFI Why?
RAFFI Are you helping them, I mean.
SEVEN When the evacuation ended and the Neutral Zone collapsed, someone needed to maintain a semblance of order.
SEVEN I suppose at this point, it's... become habit.
RAFFI I admire what you do out there.
RAFFI With the Rangers.
RAFFI Push in and then pull out...
SEVEN Yes.
SEVEN I understand.
RAFFI Okay.
RAFFI Once you get Maddox, activate the enhancer, and the doc here will beam you out.
JURATI Wait, wait, wait. Uh, hello?
RAFFI Uh, just...
RAFFI Hold on a sec. Hold that thought.
RAFFI Can you breathe?
SEVEN Yes.
JURATI What do you mean, I beam them out?
ELNOR It's a lie.
ELNOR Everybody is behaving as if they were somebody else.
ELNOR Everyone except me.
BOUNCER He's clear.
VUP [snarls]
RAFFI And, Agnes, you're on transporter duty.
JURATI Really? Me? Okay.
JURATI How-how hard is it, really?
RIOS Piece of cake.
ELNOR [imitating Rios] Aguardiente.
RIOS Ay.
JURATI Eh.
RAFFI Oh, man.
ELNOR I don't know how to not be Elnor.
PICARD Then be Elnor.
SEVEN An Elnor who never talks.
VUP [snarls]
PICARD [cartoonish French accent] Disgusting thing.
PICARD Once they get the Borg inside them, there is no coming back, no matter what they think.
PICARD Defiled is what you are.
PICARD Damned. Cursed.
VUP Quite a prize.
VUP Rare to find one with so many implants still fully operational.
PICARD She is not one of the new ones.
PICARD When the Borg entered her, she was a jeune fille.
PICARD You are going to have to dice her up to get it all out.
VUP [low growling]
PICARD A little squeamish, are we?
PICARD I can take my trade elsewhere.
VUP No.
VUP Not squeamish.
VUP Not at all.
PICARD Your work is done.
RIOS Mind if I have another drink?
PICARD It's a free planet!
VUP Let's see if there's a deal to be made.
PICARD Now, that's the kind of talk that I like.
PICARD But one last thing.
PICARD I need proof that my bounty is alive.
PICARD I need to see Maddox!
COMPUTER Gabriel Hwang located.
COMPUTER Stardust City Medical District.
RAFFI Make sure the kid sticks to the script.
RAFFI And watch your back.
RAFFI Admiral Picard.
PICARD Time to go.
RAFFI You've got this.
PICARD This is going to be very much harder without you.
RAFFI It was almost like the old days for a minute there, huh?
RAFFI I...
RAFFI I hope you find what you came out here for.
PICARD And I sincerely wish the same for you.
RAFFI Do it.
FEMALE VOICE Don't get lost in the crowd.
FEMALE VOICE At Freecloud Family Planning, your baby is our baby.
FEMALE VOICE Join our family today.
[indistinct intercom announcement]
PART THREE 
RAFFI Hello.
GABRIEL Wow.
GABRIEL Here?
GABRIEL [chuckles]
GABRIEL So, what, did you put a tracker in me or just hunt me down?
RAFFI Oh. I still hear things.
RAFFI Maybe I hunted you down a little.
RAFFI You just kind of crossed my path.
GABRIEL Path to where?
RAFFI To Freecloud.
RAFFI To you.
RAFFI Gabe, I'm clean.
RAFFI Mm-hmm.
RAFFI I feel good.
RAFFI I was not there for you.
RAFFI Even when I was there, I wasn't there.
RAFFI Especially then.
RAFFI But I'm here now, if you'll let me be.
RAFFI For you and for my little grand...?
GABRIEL She's a girl.
RAFFI Oh.
GABRIEL You know, there was a time when it would've meant the world to me to hear you say that.
RAFFI Oh.
RAFFI Oh, Gabriel. Honey...
GABRIEL So, what, you're... changed?
GABRIEL Yeah, you're different now.
RAFFI [stammers] I'm-I'm...
RAFFI [sniffles] I'm making a start, Gabe.
RAFFI I'm... I'm-I'm putting my life back together. 
RAFFI That's why I came all the way out here for you.
GABRIEL So, um... the attack on Mars.
GABRIEL Tell me how it wasn't really the synths.
RAFFI Honey...
GABRIEL Tell me about the Conclave of Eight.
GABRIEL Tell me what was worth ignoring me and Dad until we hardly recognized you.
RAFFI [stammering]
GABRIEL Why you abandoned us for some crackpot, tin hat conspiracy...
RAFFI It wasn't crackpot!
RAFFI That attack was not what it seemed!
RAFFI Baby, there is a conspiracy, and it is bigger than anybody knew.
RAFFI There were lives at stake...
GABRIEL Our lives, Mom.
GABRIEL Our lives mattered, too.
GABRIEL Just not to you.
GABRIEL I don't think you understand just how much it sucked to be your kid.
RAFFI [breathing heavily]
[door whooshes open]
[door whooshes shut]
PEL Hey.
GABRIEL Pel. Baby, um... this is my mother, Raffaela.
GABRIEL She was just passing through.
GABRIEL I guess she had a second.
PEL Hello.
PEL It's wonderful to meet you.
PEL Will you be staying a while?
GABRIEL No. Like I said, she's just passing by.
RAFFI It's so nice to meet you.
RAFFI [sniffles] Good luck with the baby.
RAFFI Goodbye, Gabe.
GABRIEL Bye, Mom.
RAFFI [hitching breaths]
MADDOX [coughing]
BJAYZL Show me.
PICARD As I was telling your Mr. Vip...
VUP Vup.
PICARD ...you will not see many more like her!
PICARD When they get assimilated as kids, more of the hardware remains inside them.
VUP Ear, eyes, neck, chest, spine, kidneys, hips, various bones.
BJAYZL I thought it could be you.
BJAYZL "Hoped" might even be the word.
BJAYZL [chuckles]
BJAYZL I always knew you were impressive.
BJAYZL I just never knew how impressive.
BJAYZL It is good to see you again.
BJAYZL Annika.
VUP [snarling]
JURATI It's okay. It will be okay.
JURATI [breathing heavily]
JURATI You can do this.
JURATI You have to do this.
JURATI [exhales]
JURATI [gasps, squeaks]
EMH What is the nature of your psychiatric emergency?
EMH Your pulse and blood pressure are significantly elevated.[panting]
JURATI Be-Because you scared the hell out of me.
EMH I'd like to give you a sedative.
JURATI I-I don't need a s...
JURATI [hyperventilating]
RIOS Agnes, you copy?
EMH Are you certain? You really...
JURATI Yes, I am certain!
RIOS Agnes?
JURATI Uh, yes. Hi.
RIOS Who are you talking to?
JURATI You.
JURATI Not you you. N-No one.
EMH Captain, Dr. Jurati's experiencing...
JURATI Deactivate EMH.
JURATI [breathing heavily]
JURATI I'm here.
RIOS The operative terms are "copy that" and "go ahead."
RIOS Something's not right.
RIOS We may have to abort.
RIOS Do you have a lock on them?
JURATI Uh, yes.
JURATI Um, affirmative.
JURATI It's, uh, showing red.
RIOS They haven't activated the pattern enhancer yet.
RIOS Let me know the instant they do.
JURATI Yes. Copy. Affirmative.
JURATI Um, whatever.
JURATI What's going on down there?
BJAYZL Are you still angry because I carved up your little friend for parts?
BJAYZL Or is it because you trusted me?
BJAYZL Oh, you were so noble then.
BJAYZL Save the outcast.
BJAYZL Rescue the forgotten.
BJAYZL You were so easy.
SEVEN Was I, Jay?
SEVEN Then how did I get away?
SEVEN How did I escape the great Bjayzl?
SEVEN A fortune in Borg tech and... you lost it.
SEVEN You lost me.
SEVEN No one's ever been worth more to you than me, and I slipped right through your fingers.
SEVEN I'm the one that got away.
BJAYZL Not anymore.
SEVEN Wrong, Jay.
BJAYZL [gasps]
SEVEN Drop your weapons.
VUP [snarling]
BJAYZL Listen to her.
BJAYZL Now!
VUP [snarls]
PICARD [regular voice] What the hell is going on here?
SEVEN I was not entirely candid with you.
PICARD Really?
ELNOR Are we still pretending?
PICARD No, Elnor.
PICARD I think everyone has finally stopped.
MADDOX [coughs]
PICARD Bruce.
PICARD How are you doing?
MADDOX Picard?
BJAYZL Picard?
BJAYZL The famous Admiral Picard?
BJAYZL [chuckles]
BJAYZL Well, it appears you thought you were playing when you were being played, Admiral.
BJAYZL I take it you had no awareness of Annika and my close, personal relationship.
SEVEN Shut up.
BJAYZL [grunts]
SEVEN Take Maddox and go.
PICARD What do you mean?
BJAYZL She means to kill me.
BJAYZL But hero to the end, our Annika, she will first save your lives.
SEVEN Just go.
PICARD You know, you were right.
PICARD This is not saving the galaxy.
PICARD This is just settling an old score.
SEVEN You have no idea what this is.
PICARD Well, tell me.
PICARD What is it?
BJAYZL [gasps]
SEVEN When the rescues ended, some of us tried to help maintain order on the worlds the Federation left behind.
SEVEN We were based on Fenris.
SEVEN One of us was a young science officer on leave from the USS Coleman.
SEVEN He was out doing recon near Daimanta when his ship received a distress call.
SEVEN It turned out to be an ambush.
SEVEN He was the closest thing I will ever have to kin.
SEVEN Like me, Icheb was a former Borg, rescued and reclaimed by Voyager in the Delta Quadrant.
SEVEN That's why she wanted him.
SEVEN His parts were...
SEVEN ...good business.
SEVEN Bjayzl had his implants stripped out.
[whirring]
[distorted scream]
SEVEN Without anesthetic.
[distorted screaming]
SEVEN Without even the minor mercy of death.
[low whirring]
[phaser fires]
SEVEN I had met her on Fenris.
SEVEN She was posing as one of us, as someone trying to help.
SEVEN She knew about Icheb from me.
PICARD But...
PICARD murder is not justice.
PICARD There is no solace in revenge.
PICARD You have had your humanity restored to you.
PICARD Don't squander it now.
[weapon fires]
[yells]
RIOS You guys ready to go yet?
SEVEN Take them.
SEVEN Activate the pattern enhancer and get them the hell out of here.
RIOS You got it.
RIOS Revenge.
RIOS I understand the impulse.
RIOS But you do this, you put a bounty on all of us.
RIOS I don't give a damn.
RIOS But the kid and the old man, they don't stand a chance out here with a price on their heads.
BJAYZL Your friend has a point, Annika.
BJAYZL Let's make a trade.
BJAYZL Maddox for my life.
RIOS Hey, hey, hey, hey.
RIOS Look at the math of it, is all I'm saying.
RIOS You found her once.
RIOS Odds are... you'll do it again.
PICARD Five to beam up, Doctor.
ELNOR Come on.
PART FOUR
JURATI I did it.
JURATI Oh, my God. Bruce.
PICARD He's in bad shape.
PICARD Exposure, dehydration.
PICARD Maybe other things.
PICARD Best to get him to sickbay quickly.
JURATI I'll take care of him.
MADDOX Aggie.
MADDOX Aggie.
PICARD Captain Rios.
RIOS Getting us the hell out of here, sir.
PICARD I'm glad of the choice you made.
PICARD It seems that a lift is the least I can offer you.
SEVEN The Rangers already sent a corsair for me.
SEVEN It should be here by now.
PICARD Ah.
SEVEN But...
SEVEN I will take two of your phasers, if that's all right.
SEVEN A vigilante could always use a couple more.
PICARD Of course.
SEVEN And... in case you ever need a vigilante.
PICARD Thank you.
SEVEN After they brought you back from your time in the Collective... do you honestly feel that you regained your humanity?
PICARD Yes.
SEVEN All of it?
PICARD [whispers] No.
PICARD But we're both working on it.
PICARD Aren't we?
SEVEN Every damn day of my life.
[phaser whirrs]
SEVEN Hi.
[screaming, gasping, crying]
BJAYZL Well.
BJAYZL Frankly, I was surprised when you left.
BJAYZL I thought you'd bet on... shooting your way out.
SEVEN I am.
BJAYZL How sentimental of you, then.
BJAYZL Risking your... revenge... while saving their lives.
BJAYZL Almost reminds me of...
BJAYZL ...the Annika of old.
SEVEN Me, too.
SEVEN [chuckles]
SEVEN Picard still thinks there's a place in the galaxy for mercy.
SEVEN I didn't want to disillusion him.
SEVEN Somebody out here ought to have a little hope.
BJAYZL Like you used to have... before I took it away from you.
SEVEN Something like that.
SEVEN You're stalling, Jay.
SEVEN Your second security wave will be here in less than five seconds.
BJAYZL Annika...
SEVEN He was a son to me, Jay.
SEVEN This is for him.
[running steps approaching]
[indistinct shouting]
MADDOX [weak, rasping breath]
COMPUTER Massive abdominal hemorrhaging.
COMPUTER Increase clotting factor by twelve percent.
PICARD They really worked you over.
MADDOX Dahj... is dead, isn't she?
PICARD She found me.
PICARD And then I lost her.
PICARD I'm profoundly sorry.
MADDOX [muffled grunting]
MADDOX When the Tal Shiar came for me... blew up my lab... I knew.
MADDOX [rasping breath]
MADDOX Her embedded Mom AI wouldn't have activated her unless she was in grave danger.
PICARD Bruce.
PICARD Bruce.
MADDOX [muffled grunting]
PICARD I have to know...
PICARD Does she have a sister?
MADDOX [weakly] Yes. Soji.
PICARD Soji?
PICARD Where is she?
MADDOX [panting]
MADDOX She's on the Artifact.
PICARD The Artifact?
PICARD You mean...
PICARD Not the captured Borg cube?
PICARD Why?
MADDOX S-Same reason I sent her sister to Earth.
MADDOX To find the truth.
PICARD The truth about what?
MADDOX The ban.
MADDOX There are lies upon lies.
MADDOX They're hiding something.
PICARD Who?
MADDOX I don't know.
MADDOX It's the same ones who are hunting her.
PICARD The Romulans?
MADDOX Not just them.
MADDOX I think the Federation are involved.
MADDOX That's what I sent them to find out.
MADDOX [weak, shuddering breath]
JURATI Admiral, he's barely stable.
JURATI He needs to rest.
MADDOX [coughs]
PICARD Understood.
PICARD I'll leave you to it.
RIOS The Artifact?
RIOS That's in Romulan space.
PICARD Uh-huh.
RIOS Flying into Romulan space doubles my fee.
RIOS Okay, jefe.
