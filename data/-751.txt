PART ONE 

COS Book, you son of a bitch.

BK Little busy here, Cosmo.

COS You stole what I stole!

BK So what?

COS That's my cargo and you took it from me!

BK It doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to itself.

Commander Michael Burnham,
Starfleet.

Commander Michael Burnham,

science officer, USS Discovery.

Serial number SC0064-0974SHN.

Science officer, USS Discovery.

Serial number SC0064-0974SHN.

BK Stand up.

Walk.

Stop it!
It doesn't belong to you!

You think you can just take it

'cause you knocked me
out of the sky?

BRN I'm not trying to take anything.
That was an accident.

BK No one comes all the way
out here by accident.

BRN I am telling you, stop!

Now, nobody has to get hurt.
BK You might.

BRN I am not fighting you.

You're fighting me.

My name...
BK I don't want to know.

BRN Listen.

BK I listen better without you
holding that antique to my head.

Want to put that down?

BRN No.

BK Okay. On three?

One.
BRN I'm counting.

BK Fine, you count. Damn.

BRN One. Two.

Three.

BRN My name is...
BK I do not want
your acquaintance.

The nearest natural wormhole is
a hundred light-years from here.

That means
you came out of a wormhole

you created with tech
from I don't know where.

You think ripping holes in space
is a good idea?

Wasn't bad enough for you
the Gorn destroyed

two light-years' worth
of subspace?

BRN Wait, the Gorn did what?

BK How many people do you think are
on channels right now saying,

"I saw a crazy woman
in a funny suit.

Anyone want to buy
some last known coordinates?"

BRN -I...
BK -Where'd you get that weapon?

I don't want to know.

Your rocket girl outfit
scanned for tritanium alloy.

Hasn't been anything like that
in years.

BRN Do not call me "rocket girl."

BK You're not from
around these parts.

Go back to your own parts.

BRN I can't.

Is this Terralysium?

BK It's Hima. Who are you?

Never mind!
I don't want to know.

BRN Where-where is Hima?

What star system?
BK I'm on a clock.

BRN What sector?
BK Bye-bye.

BRN What quadrant?

My name is Michael...

It was not my intention
to crash into your ship.

I am sorry.

For all of it.

What's your name?

I lost my crew.
BK Oh, yeah?

BRN They may be dead.

I don't know where I am.

I have nowhere to go back to.

The only thing I can do
right now... is trust something.

Or someone.

And I am sorry
you don't want it to be...

...but it's you.

So, please.

Please help me.

Comms?

BK Hey! Don't touch anything.

BRN Transmitter, receiver,
subspace amplifier.

Nice.
BK You know what'd be really nice?

If you could whip up
a new dilithium recrystallizer.

Mine cracked like a lychee
when you ran into my ship.

I got to get my cargo
to a certain planet

by a certain time, so unless
you have benamite lying around,

and no one does,
I can't fly quantum slipstream.

Tachyon solar sails
are slow as shit,

and don't even get me started
on trilithium.

All of which means,
thanks to you,

I need more dilithium.

The only place I can trade
for it is at the Mercantile.

And there is not one damn thing
good about me sticking

my head up at the Mercantile.

Right, baby?

BRN Y-You have a very large cat.

BK Yes.

She has a thyroid condition.

BRN Does she have a name?

BK Grudge.

BRN Because...?

BK She's heavy and all mine.

BRN The Mercantile.

Is there
a subspace comms array there?

A way that I can contact
my ship?

BK They got nothing unless
you got something to trade.

You have something?

'Cause I need dilithium,

and I'm space broke.

BRN Apparently, I have antiques.

Can you get the dilithium
you need for this?

It's a tricorder.

PART TWO 

BK Cover that uniform.
Try to look normal.

BRN You ever gonna tell me
your name?

BK Book.

The name's Book.

BRN Your cargo is
temperature-sensitive?

And you don't want
anyone else to find it.

I'm guessing your cargo
used to be someone else's cargo.

BK It was never his.
BRN You stole it.

BK I repatriated it.

BRN You're a thief.
BK Courier.

Someone needs something
to get somewhere, I bring it.

And I can say two things
about you.

That moral compass of yours
led you straight

into a midspace collision that
could have killed both of us.

BRN What's the other thing?

BK You believe in ghosts.

BRN What does that mean?

BK That badge on your shirt.

Sometimes you see a guy
with one of those badges

getting himself all worked up
about the Federation.

The old days.

True believers.

Can't handle that it's gone.

BRN The Federation is gone?

That's impossible.

What happened?

BK Beats me.

BRN What happened?

BK Collapsed, I guess.

It was a long time ago.

After the Burn.

BRN What's the Burn?

BK "What's the Burn?"

How can you not know this stuff?

Seriously, where are you from?

I don't want to know.

BRN Please.

BK The Burn was the day
the galaxy took a hard left.

Dilithium.

One day,
most of it just went boom.

BRN Dilithium is the heart
of every warp-capable ship.

What does that mean?

Did it destabilize?

How?

BK I don't know.
A lot of people died.

The Federation couldn't say
for sure what happened or why,

or that it wouldn't
happen again.

Think they tried to hang on,
but after a while,

they just weren't
around anymore.

BRN That's not possible.

BK Okay.
BRN When?

BK A hundred, 120 years ago.
Before I was born.

BRN No.

No, the Federation isn't just
about ships and warp drive.

It's about a vision

and all those
who believe in that vision.

BK That's nice.

Do yourself a favor
and take off that badge

before we get to Requiem.

MALE Next.

Stand here.

BRN The Andorians and the Orions
are working together?

BK They don't get a lot
of walk-ins here.

Follow my lead.
Try not to get us shot.

MALE Next. Step up.

SECURITY She stays out there.

BK She's got something.

SECURITY I don't know what that is,
and if I did, I wouldn't care.

She's not a courier,
she stays out there.

BK Pretend you're not Andorian
for one second

and don't be a surly bastard.

You know those
antique collectors who love

to live in the past?

This stuff's like the holy grail
to them.

I know Andorians don't do fun,

but there's a real market
for this stuff.

Your bosses are watching.

You want to be the one
who tells them

you turned away
a prime supplier?

SECURITY Fine.

No identification, no...

MALE VOICE Let them in!

SECURITY I wouldn't if it were up to me.

BRN It's not.

BK This is gonna go bad if
you have to have the last word.

BRN Where's the communications hub?

BK Relax. I told you
I'll take you there

so you can call your damn ship.

MALE VOICE Order 7543...

BRN How does this work?

BK Holo seller fixes a price
for an item.

Holo buyer negotiates,
they make a deal.

Regulator signs off,
confirms payment to the Orions.

Orions pay couriers like me

just enough dilithium to pick up
the item and make delivery.

Then it's back here
for another go-round.

Every now and then, we get
to make a deal for ourselves.

Like your tricorder.

BRN A portable transporter? Hah

BK Subspace array's through here.

Keep your head down.

We set now?

BRN A deal's a deal.

I hope you get
what you need for it.

Good luck.

BK This is their vault,
not their comms.

You're in a stasis beam.

BRN You don't know what
you're doing. My... my crew.

BK Everybody's got a story.
A broken tricorder won't cut it.

I need all the dilithium
I can get to finish my run.

BRN When I get out of this,
I am coming for you.

BK You and everybody else.

I'm sorry.

ROBOT Do not move.

You are under arrest.

PART THREE

ITH So, even if you managed
to get into our vault,

what makes you think
you could get out of here alive?

MALE ANDORIAN That wasn't rhetorical.
Answer the question.

ITH Where is your ship?
MALE ANDORIAN Who are you working with?

BRN I don't have a ship.

ITH Of course she's working
with somebody.
MALE ANDORIAN Yes, you have a ship,

or you wouldn't be here.
ITH Where is the merchandise?

The vintage tech.
He asked. Where's
the merchandise?

BRN I got robbed in the stasis beam.

ITH Nobody's that stupid.

BRN I am gonna hurt that man.

MALE ANDORIAN Who?

MALE ORION This is taking too long.

I'm hungry.
Let's get a sandwich.

BRN Damn.

MALE ANDORIAN Finally.
ITH Here we go.

Well, that's not right.

Did you adjust the dosage again?

I've told you
so many times not to do that!

BRN This stuff has a real,
integral consciousness.

ITH Yeah, it makes people truthful.
They talk.

BRN Yes, yes, I feel that.
I feel you. I get that.

I have a friend with red hair.
You cannot give her any.

MALE ANDORIAN Where did you get
the vintage gear?

BRN Vintage is a matter
of perspective, isn't it?

Because, to me, you are aqua,
but to me, you are forest green.

ITH How are you connected
to the Federation?
MALE ANDORIAN Where's your ship?

BRN I'm dying to talk about it.
I'm dying to talk about it,

because today does not happen
to people.

Ever.

I might be angry about it.
I'm supportive.

I mean, I'm so supportive!

I am reflexively supportive.
And what is that about?

I'm overcompensating.

I got to talk to someone.
You need to sit.

Can you sit? It's a super cool
story. It's just,

in a completely devastating way.

BK Hadley, look, I need
more dilithium, or I'm done.

I need you to access your
highest self in this moment.

HADLEY -Why?
BRN -I'm accessing my highest self.

Can we both just imagine

what this world would feel like
if we accessed...?

HADLEY If you stop talking?

Yes, that would feel nice.

Which is why
I'm walking away now.

No deal.

BK Well, Had-- wait.

You're welcome.

COS Move! Slowly.

BK Cosmo, nice to see you again.

COS Shut up!

BRN We left everything that I have
ever known or loved behind me.

For the sake of creation!

Right? If you think about it--
let's be honest--

I saved all the things.

And then I shot out
of a wormhole and I hit a guy.

ITH What guy?

BRN Uh, him, him. You know?

I-- He, he stole
somebody's cargo

and he can't fly for shit...

ITH Wait. One of our guys?

A courier?
BRN Yeah.

You guys have a real problem
if your couriers

are stealing stuff
and then colliding

with thousand-year-old women
in space.

ITH What cargo was he hauling?
BRN I don't know.

But it was temperature-sensitive
and really valuable,

so it's probably ice cream.

MALE ANDORIAN Is he still in the building?

ITH What's his name?

BRN Book.

COS Where is it? I'm going to roast Grude and feed her to the starving. 

BK You keep her name
out of your mouth, Cosmo.

COS She'll feed a whole planet.

BK She's a queen.

ITH Stop!

BK Got to go.
ITH Is that him?

BRN Yep.

BK Hey.
BRN Hi.

BK Hello to you, too.

COS Does anyone care if I shoot him?

ITH You're not allowed a weapon
in here.

COS He stole my cargo! Let me shoot him. 

ITH Get our cargo back first.

COS Fine. Can I shoot him then? 

BRN Oh, man.

Do you think I'm compensating
for something?

BK They sprayed you with the stuff,
didn't they?

BRN They sure did.
BK Adrenaline will knock it out
of you in a bit.
BRN Okay.

What?

BK Give me the dilithium.
All right? You can come with me.

BRN I am done being
reflexively supportive.

BK Come on!

BRN Where is the comms array?

Hang on!

BK We have to move.
They'll be tracking the... aah!

BRN I need to call my ship!

BK First things first.

We have to go.

Go. Go, go, go!

BRN Get us out of here!

BK It needs 30 seconds to recharge.

BRN I may have broken your nose
earlier. I apologize.

BK Are you saying that
in case we die?
BRN Yep.

Book, come on.

BK It's still charging!

Okay. You're
about to be really mad!

BRN What?

BK They can't track us underwater
or into solid material.

Ah. You're welcome.

BRN You pushed me off a cliff.

BK Told you you were gonna be mad.

If you're thinking about
punching me again, we're alive.

I could have guessed coordinates
inside a rock.

They'll find us soon enough.

BRN I haven't been shot in a while.

BK *praying in alien language*

BRN What was that?

BK Don't want your arm
to get infected.

BRN Were you... praying?

BK Something like.

BRN Got a bite to it.

BK Should probably
still wrap it, though.

BRN You carry a handkerchief?

BK Man's got to blow his nose.

I'm opening up whatever
subspace channels still exist.

But make it fast.

Cosmo won't buy me dying
that easy.

They'll be scanning for us.

That does a bit of everything.
Call your ship.

BRN You had this the whole time,
and you're just showing me now?

BK Your people are waiting for you.

BRN Burnham to Discovery. Come in.

Discovery...

please come in.

Discovery, please come in.

BK Maybe they made it
to that planet, Terralysium.

BRN If any crew on any ship could
make it through, it's mine.

BK True believer.
BRN Yeah.

BK Time traveler.

BRN Yeah.

BK I figured.

Don't know how you came by
whatever you used to get here.

All time travel technology
was destroyed

after the temporal wars.

Outlawed.

BRN There was no other way.

For me...

...or my crew.

I have to find them.

I have to.

BK Good. We've still got
a few hours.

BRN This wasn't just about Grudge
being lonely.

BK Nope.

BRN Are you gonna tell me
what's in the hold?

BK Nope.

SECURITY Stop. Freeze.
Don't move.

Don't.

ITH Drop your weapons.

What good is a courier
who lets his cargo get stolen?

COS Hey, I'm the best runner you have in the quadrant.

(COSMO gets shot and vaporizes) 

MALE ANDORIAN Access code.

BK You don't want it.

MALE ANDORIAN I think I do.

ITH Oh, we definitely do.

BK Really. You don't.

ITH Give us the code now.

BK Okay, fine.

Sticky.

MALE ANDORIAN What?

ITH What kind of code is that?

BK 'Cause that's the damn code,
all right?

Pick your own code
on your own ship.

ITH Don't shoot it.

It's served fresh.

MALE ANDORIAN It looks smaller on the holo.

ITH It's not moving. Is it dead?

BK Close your eyes.

BRN Uh, Book?

BK Stay still, please.

No! No!

MOLLY (eats them all, gruesomley) 

BK Molly, no!

*Speaks alien language*

Thanks, girl.

Hey. Hey.

You all right?

BRN Yeah.
BK Yeah?

BRN I really...

really didn't know how this day
was gonna turn out.

BK Okay, good.

PART FOUR 

BRN How long have you been
saving them, the trance worms?

BK Not long enough.

They used to be everywhere,
you know, before the...

BRN Before the Federation fell.

There's no one around to enforce
the Endangered Species Act.

Except you.

May I ask...

You seem to have
this connection to things.

Plants, the trance worms.

What is it like,
feeling everything?

BK Uncomfortable.

My family are killers, poachers.

Every so often, one like me
shows up in the gene pool.

I don't know, something
to do with balance, I guess.

BRN Do you still see them?

BK I'm not welcome.

BRN I'm sorry.

BK But I wouldn't trade
who I am for anything.

I wouldn't want to be different.

This is Cleveland Booker.

Mandelbrot Set code nautilus.

One more to come home.

FEMALE VOICE Your code is accepted, Book.

Welcome to Sanctuary Four.

BRN "Sanctuary"?

BK They have a breeding cycle.

We got her here just in time.

BRN Some of them still make it.

BK This is what my planet
used to be like.

Till I had to leave it behind.

How much did you leave behind?

BRN 930 years.

BK Why?

BRN To ensure the future.

A future.

BK Thank you.

BRN I didn't do it alone.

I have no idea how to start
looking for my ship.

BK I think I know someone
who could help.

This is a courier waypoint,

but it used to be
a Federation relay station.

BRN What happened?

BK Main reactor breach, probably.

Long time ago.

No one around to pick up
the pieces anymore.

COMP Greetings.

Please proceed
to the attendant desk.

Thank you.

BRN Hello.

ADI Welcome to Starfleet.

May I help you?

BRN I'm Commander Michael Burnham,

science officer, USS Discovery.

Serial number SC0064-0974SHN.

ADI I am Aditya Sahil,
Federation liaison.

It would be my honor to assist
you, Commander Burnham.

BRN I need to locate the warp
signature of a starship

with the identifier NCC1031.

ADI Yes, yes, of course.

I'm afraid, uh, it's not here.

I have two Federation ships
in flight at the moment.

These are
the only Federation ships

in a 600-light-year radius.

BRN What about the other sectors?

ADI I only have access
to these sectors.

BRN You've been cut off
from the other sectors?

Entirely?

ADI Long-range sensors
failed decades ago.

I have not been able to scan
beyond 30 sectors since then.

I would imagine...
it is the same for all others.

May I ask...

how is it you don't know...

what we all know?

BRN I'm from the past, Mr. Sahil.

From before the Burn.

Before the collapse.

My ship was right behind me,
in the wormhole.

So either they landed somewhere

way far out of comms range...

...or they're not here yet.

ADI Then...

by the laws
of temporal mechanics,

they could arrive tomorrow

or...
BRN In a thousand years.

ADI Commander Burnham,

now I'll tell you a secret.

I'm not a commissioned officer.

You see, my father was.
His father before him.

But unlike them,
I was never officially sworn in.

There has been no one to do it.

Yet I watch this office
every day,

as I have for 40 years,
believing...

one day others like me
would walk through that door,

that my hope was not in vain.

Today is that day.

And that hope...

is you, Commander Burnham.

BRN True believers.

BK Of course.

ADI I don't know how much
of the Federation still exists.

I simply do my part
to keep it alive.

Now...

...I ask you to do me
a great honor.

This has been in my family
for generations.

Only a commissioned officer
may raise it.

And I've waited so long
to see it on that wall.

BRN Mr. Sahil,

you are as real
a Federation officer

as any I have ever met.

If you would do me the honor,

we need an acting
communications chief

who can keep searching
for my ship.

Will you accept the commission?

ADI Hope is a powerful thing.

BRN Sometimes it's the only thing.

ADI Our numbers are few.

Our spirit is undiminished.

BRN If there are others out there,
we'll find them.

We will.

THE END
