PART ONE

RAN The Cerritos is
in orbit around Beta III.

Back in the day,
these guys worshipped

a violent god
called Landru, who suppressed

their creativity
and made them kill each othe,

until Kirk figured out
it was actually a computer.

Get this.

At some point,
these knuckleheads went

back to worshipping Landru.

Captain Freeman has been

setting them straight
all morning.

CAP I can't believe you all started


 


re-worshipping
the dang computer.

RESIDENT Well, Landru's very persuasive.

LANDRU Consume the
intruders! Obey Landru!

CAP Hey, don't make me paradox you
into destroying yourself.

LANDRU Landru apologizes.

CAP This is literally
the exact thing.

Captain Kirk taught you.

Maybe write it down this time?

Cerritos, two to beam up.

RESIDENT TWO Well, I like purging people
during the red hour.

I'm going to keep doing it.

RESIDENT THREE Dude, there is
no more red hour, okay?

- Let it go.
RESIDENT TWO - But I just bought a new scythe.

CAP Ugh, Landru.


 


RAN I know, it's always weird
revisiting planets

- from the TOS era.
CAP - TOS?

RAN It's what I call the 2260s.

Stands for "those old
scientists"... you know, Spock,

Scotty, those guys.
Seems like they were stumbling

on crazy new aliens
every week back then.

CAP Nothing against
second contact missions,

but the Cerritos
should be popping in

on those legacy civilizations
before they unravel.

RAN Yeah, but "popping in" is
against regulation.

We would need specific orders.

CAP I just hate seeing a perfectly
good society get destroyed

by a Gamester of Triskelion
or whatever,

because Starfleet has a policy
of some intervention.

- Set coordinates
for Starbase 77.
CREWMAN - Sorry, Captain,

but we still have crew
on Beta III.

CAP I didn't authorize that.
Who is it?

MAR Art supplies!
Get your art supplies!

We got paints,
we got brushes,

we got a spiky, pencil,
twirl-around thingy.

Boost your creativity!
Express yourself!

Stop praying to a computer!

Hoo boy,
incoming lecture in five,

four...

BOIM Who wants crayons?
Here you go, kid.

Way better than the red hour.

MAR Since when
do you break protocol?

BOIM I'm just tired of you getting
to do all the good stuff

while I stick to the rules.

COM Ensign Boimler? Do you read?

MAR Whoa-ho-ho,

look at Brad Boimler
being cool for once.

Wait, is this
because of my teachings?

BOIM Okay, you don't teach.
You just instigate chaos.

MAR Exactly... helpful,
character-building chaos.

I can hear you, can you hear me?

Aw, Boims!
I thought you were gonna

get stuck
in middle management,

like this pathetic
little fly in amber, like...

- Oh, like Ransom!
RAN - I am not a little fly in amber!

MAR What did it, huh?
My constant mockery?

My non-stop prodding?
My downright-dangerous hazing?

BOIM No, no. Look.

If you have to know,
I found out about your secret.

MAR You mean never eating after
7:00? It's a miracle, right?

- I mean, it does work,
you should try it.
BOIM - Captain Freeman is your mom.

MAR Yeah, I don't, I don't know
what you're talking about.

BOIM Oh, come on, Mariner.
The captain's your mom.

Your dad's an admiral.

You're basically
Starfleet royalty.

How cool is that?

MAR Shut the hell up right now,
Boimler.

- Shut your mouth.
BOIM - This is a good thing!

Now we can both do some good
and you'll just, you know,

keep us out of trouble
with your mom...

MAR - What?! No that is not how...
BOIM - I just don't understand

- why it's such a secret. I'd be telling everyone.
CAP - Move!

MAR Dude, I do not want people
knowing my mom is my mom!

BOIM Okay, okay.
I'm not gonna tell a soul.

MAR I'm being serious! Shut up!

BOIM So, uh, does Captain Mommy
give you,

uh, sweet little captain kisses?

CREWMAN - Plasma ring scan is complete,
Captain Dayton.
DAYTON - Oh, yeah.

I loved the Rubidoux,
but nothing beats

a brand new ship... hey!

Who peeled this film
off the weapons panel?!

Come on, guys!

I want the Solvang to be
perfect for as long as possible.

Hey! Take those shoes
off right now!

What?

- Aah! What the hell was that?!
CREWMAN - We're being fired upon.

OPS OFFICER - Raise shield, red alert.
DAYTON - Get us out of here!

OPS OFFICER Shields at ten percent.

Direct hit to main engines.

DAYTON Warp! Now!

TEN Ah! I can't believe I get

to be orientation liaison
for a new recruit.

I am going
to show her so many ropes.

Hello? Rutherford?

RUTH Sorry. Just trying
to adjust this little thingy

on my implant's
attitude selector.

Crazy about Mariner
and the captain, right?

Oh, man, Captain Freeman Day

is gonna be super awkward
this year.

TEN There's the shuttle!

RUTH Huh. Look at this new button!

Optimistic mode?
This is going to be great!

But... sexy mode? Mmm.

Don't mind if I do.

'Ello. Chim
chimurri. What's all this then?

Aw, it's beautiful!

Oh, there she is...
The little robot exocomp!

PHAMP Oh, my gosh. Hi.
Are you Ensign Tendi?

TEN Oh, my gosh. Yes, I am!
And I'm so happy you're here!

PHAMP I'm happy to be here!
This is so exciting!

RUTH Ooh-wee! Howdy there.
Now I'm talking like a cowboy.

PHAMP- That was a weird thing to say!
TEN - It sure was!

PART TWO

CAP Ugh. Why did we ever keep this
a secret in the first place?

MAR Ugh! I just wanted to fly
under the radar!

CAP And I didn't want anyone to know
the most demerited officer

in the fleet was my daughter.

MAR Well, Wesley Crusher worked
with his mom.

Maybe
everybody'll be cool about it.

RAN Captain, captain's daughter...
Uh, I mean Mariner.

CAP Oh, what is it, Jack?

RAN Captain,
I'm putting together a list

of candidates
for the Sacramento promotion.

I'd love your input.
RAN May I just say

I am very sorry
if I ever treated you

with anything other
than admiration.

MAR Oh, shut up, Ransom!
You're such a suck-up!

RAN From now on, I'll make sure
to give you special attention.

CAP No! Be as hard on her
as you always are!

MAR - Yeah, be hard on me!
RAN - I'm only hard on you

when you make me hard! I mean,
I'm-I'm not hard right now!

I mean, I could... I could
get hard, if I wanted to,

but I'm not hard right now.
I'm so sorry! You're both great!

MAR Ugh!

CREWMAN I heard
she's the captain's daughter.

STEVE Hey, Mariner,
I'm Lieutenant Levy.

We went on a date last year.
I don't know if you recall.

MAR Yeah, Steve, I remember.

You said
Wolf 359 was an inside job.

STEVE It totally was.
So, hey, I was wondering,

could give this
to your mom for me?

It's just a few ideas I threw
together on how to decorate

- the captain's yacht.
MAR - Fine. Whatever.

STEVE  You're the best.
Thanks, Mariner.

Changelings aren't real.
The Dominion War didn't happen!

CREWMAN Hey, Mariner! Okay, can you just?

- Oh, okay, little closer.
MAR - Hey, don't log that, all right?

- I don't want
to see that up on the... Oh!
- Hey!

T'ANA This is a service corridor,
not a social club, Ensign.

Sorry, Doc. Won't happen again.

You think
your mom would be okay

with me and Shaxs making
a little love connection?

I'd love to snag that Bajoran
beefsteak with my coital hooks.

CREWMAN Captain, we've received
a partial distress call

from the Solvang.

CAP I guess Captain Dayton's
still getting used

to the controls in her new ship.

CREWMAN Sir, the signal originated
in the Kalla system.

CAP Well, there isn't anything
distressing there.

RAN The Titan is also within range.

CAP No. Let them know
that we have it.

Dayton's going to hate
that we came running

to her rescue because
someone leaned on a button.

MAR Oh, this sucks.

BILL Yo, yo, Mariner!

I was just crossing
through the, um, lower decks,

and I replicated you
some hand pies.

Hand... What is a hand pie?
You know what? No thank you.

BOIM - Ooh, key lime? Mmm. Mmm.
MAR - I won't be able

to do any of my usual
sneaky Robin Hood stuff

now that everybody's
paying attention to me.

Yesterday, he literally
didn't know my name.

He called me "Jen."
Who here is named "Jen"?!

BOIM Ugh. You are so right. He was
clearly kissing your butt.

It's not like
he had a prewritten letter

of recommendation which would
save you so much time

since all you had
to do is sign it.

MAR - Oh, Boimler, not you!
BOIM - Ransom's picking someone

to promote to the Sacramento.
I need an edge!

MAR Dude, I thought
you were done being lame!

BOIM Yeah, but it's the Sac.
That's a huge career boost!

And didn't you say you'd get me
in a captain's chair?

LUNDY Mariner!
Looking good, girlfriend!

MAR Get phased, Lundy.

Wait. No one would know me
on the Sacramento.

I'd be a nobody again,
like you!

BOIM I'm not a nobody. I...

MAR Maybe I should apply
to the Sacramento.

I don't know.
They might be looking

for someone a little less
criminally insubordinate.

Good call. I'd better start
adjusting my attitude, sir.

BOIM - Ew. Don't call me "sir."
MAR - Yes, sir.

BOIM - Don't.
MAR - You technically
outrank me, sir.

BOIM - What are you doing? Stop it.
MAR - Is that an order?

BOIM - Yes. I mean, no.
MAR- Permission to go
to my station, sir?

BOIM - You have a station?
MAR - Ha-ha! Good one, sir. Mm-hmm.

BOIM Nobody's gonna fall for that.

SHAX I want to give Mariner
a present!

TEN That's a processing hub,

and that's a pattern-buffer
maintenance hatch.

So, hey, um, do you want me
to call you "Exocomp,"

or do you have
an alpha-numeric name,

like TT30311?

PHAMP No.
I didn't want to sound robotic.

I wanted to be called
something normal,

so I analyzed
all Federation languages

and calculated
a mathematically perfect name.

TEN - What is it?
PHAMP - Peanut Hamper.

TEN Peanut Hamper?

I love it!

MAR Heading
to Commander Ransom's office?

BOIM - Cut it out.
MAR - Cut what out, sir?

I'm heading there as well,
to explain

why I should be promoted
over to the Sacramento.

BOIM You know,
Ransom's not just some meathead.

He's gonna see
right through you.

RAN Boimler,
your record is spotless.

It's freaky.

BOIM Thank you, sir.
There is more on the back.

RAN On the other hand, Mariner is
the captain's daughter.

MAR Mm, sort of stuck
between a rock

and a kiss-ass place,
aren't we, sir?

RAN Boimler, you're so promotable,

but I live to serve the captain.

I can't think until I work out.

BOIM You've been lifting
this whole time.

RAN Get out of here!

I'm trying to think...!

PHAMP Ooh!

Hmm, dilithium.

It's better than I thought.

Dang it!
Aw, shoot. Ooh, ooh.

Sorry.
Ensign Klutz reporting for duty.

TEN Ah, Peanut Hamper is such
an innocent little robot.

I got to make sure
she doesn't get overwhelmed

during our shift, you know,
since she doesn't have

- any hands.
RUTH - With you watching out for her,

- I'm sure she'll do great.
TEN - Whoa. Are you mad at me?

I just think that Dr. T'ana's
going to be mean, and...

RUTH I'm not.
I'm just trying to click

this attitude button
until I get back to normal.

Just make sure
you treat Peanut Hamper

the same as you would
anyone else.

TEN - But she's not like anyone else.
PHAMP - Oopsy-daisy.

TEN She's been trying to pick
those tubes up this whole time.

- How's she supposed to do
medical stuff?
PHAMP - Oh! Dang it!

T'ANA All right,
here comes the messy part.

Any slight error here
can result in instant death.

TEN Um, Dr. T'ana, just a heads-up
that Peanut Hamper might have

a little bit of trouble with...

Oh. Oh, wow.

T'ANA Peanut Hamper, this is
some of the best micro-suturing

I've ever seen.

PHAMP I downloaded all your journal
articles. I learned a lot.

TEN Oh, I-I could help you
With that leg if you want.

T'ANA Tendi, hang back.
I don't want you to get

in Peanut Hamper's way.
Ooh. What did you just do there?

PHAMP It's a new skin graft technique
I've been developing.

- It uses half the skin.
T'ANA - Oh, can you show me
how to do it?

- Can I... can I see?
PHAMP - Yeah, look at that right there.

See how the flesh
just folds together?

T'ANA A I do!

TEN Wow. Doc is really taking
to Peanut Hamper.

BAJORAN Hey, don't worry. I'm sure
you'll still have a lot to do.

I mean, for example, you know,
we could start working on me,

getting me back up on my feet.

TEN Worry? I'm her liaison.

Peanut Hamper fitting in is
my greatest victory!

Meld that flesh, girl!

PHAMP Melding away!

MAR Ah. "Tips for Remaining
Starfleet Uniform Compliant."

BOIM The Starfleet Manual?
Who are you kidding?

It is so messed up
that you're trying

to cheat me out of a promotion.

MAR How am I cheating?
You're always

telling me to be like this.

BOIM I meant to actually try
sometimes!

- Not to profit off of nepotism.
MAR - Nobody would know
Freeman's my mom

if you hadn't ratted me out,

so why don't you go ahead
and blame yourself?

BOIM - No! I blame you!
MAR - And I blame you right back!

PART THREE

RAN Red alert.

Shields up.

SHAX Collision alert. Impacts
on Decks Three, 15 and 20.

CAP - My God! Is that the Solvang?
RAN I'm not reading any life signs.

The whole crew,
they've been wiped out.

CAP They're harvesting the wreckage!

Evasive maneuvers.

SHAX - Shields at 50%.
CAP - Send out a distress call,

- all frequencies.
CREWMAN - They're jamming communications.

SHAX Captain, they've
latched onto the port nacelle

with some sort of mining arm.

RAN - Go to warp. Get us out of here!
CAP - No! Shut down engines.

But we'll be sitting ducks.

CAP Dayton would have thought
the same thing,

and look what happened to them.
Shut it down!

MAR Mom!

CAP I-I'm okay.

CREWMAN Auxiliary power back online.

PAKLEDS Ha-ha-ha! I thought
the Enterprise was strong.

We are strong.

CAP This isn't the Enterprise.
This is the Cerritos.

PAKLEDS We thought you were
the Enterprise.

CAP Pakleds?
What the hell do you want?

PAKLEDS We want your ship pieces
to add to our ship pieces,

so that we have
all the ship pieces!

CAP Look, just stop this senseless
attack, and let's discuss...

PAKLEDS No!

No.

We are strong!

We will cut your ship apart!

CAP This doesn't make any sense.

The Pakleds aren't
this powerful.

RAN I thought
they were kind of a joke.

BOIM Yeah, you guys aren't wrong.

Pakleds would fake
distress calls

so they could steal technology

from anyone who showed up
to help, but I'm detecting

weapons from over
30 different species.

CAP Ah, looks like
they're not a joke anymore.

SHAX - They're phasering the hull!
RAN - Carving us up like
a First Contact Day salmon.

CAP No engines, no weapons, fighting
an enemy we don't understand.

RAN We're out of options!

CAP Then I need someone
to make me some.

MAR Me? What am I supposed to do?
I-I don't know these guys.

CAP Do what you do best.

I need a dangerous,
half-baked solution

that breaks Starfleet codes
and totally pisses me off.

That's an order.

MAR - Boimler, what kind of computer
systems do the Pakleds use?
BOIM - They steal components

from other cultures,
which means their code base

- would have to be wide open.
MAR - You catch that, Rutherford?

RUTH We need a virus that takes
advantage of a trusting system!

MAR Exactly.
Wait, why are you so chipper?

RUTH Implant stuff!

MAR They've got us outgunned,
and they know it.

But they're taking their time.

If we can plant a virus
in their system,

- we can cripple their ship.
RAN - Who here could whip up
a code like that?

They'd have to be some sort
of morally bankrupt genius.

RUTH Ha-ha! Computer, start program
Rutherford Training Beta 2.5.

BAD Can I teach you a lesson?

RUTH Badgey! I need you
to code a virus for me.

BAD Hmm, to do that, I would need
you to disable safety protocols.

RUTH Wait.

You're not gonna try
to kill me again, are you?

Ha-ha! I'm Badgey!

Uh, fine.

Computer,
disable safety protocols.

BAD Oh, yeah!
There we go.

Hello, Father.

I've already created
three viruses

that would disable
Pakled technology.

RUTH You were monitoring comms?

BAD Oh, I'm always monitoring comms.

- The packet needs
to be input manually.
RUTH - Ho-ho-ho!

- Somebody's gonna have
to board their ship!
BAD - You know it!

RAN Intruders beaming in!

Very slowly beaming in.

MAR We've got to go!

SHAX We have to get to the armory!

RAN Looks like we'll have to repel
them the old-fashioned way.

Setting my fists to stun
and my kicks to kill.

MAR Uh, guys, right here. Yep.
Great stuff in that one.

- All the way in back there?
CAP - How much contraband
have you hidden on my ship?

MAR I don't know. A lot.

RAN Side roll. Side roll.

Double hand punch!

PAKLEDS - Pakled!
BOIM - Mariner,
in case we don't make it...

MAR We're making it.

BOIM I wasn't mad
that you were stealing

the Sacramento promotion.

I apply for those all the time.

Nothing ever comes of it.

MAR What? Then why were
you freaking out?

BOIM Because you would have gotten
it. And I'd-I'd miss you, okay?

BOIM  - You're my best friend.
MAR - Oh, haven't you shared
enough secrets today?

Just shut up!

Pakled!

Mom!

MAR Ransom, get our backs!

RAN Way ahead of you!

PAKLEDS My head!

T'ANA *yowls* Sorry.

I mean get the captain
to the biobed, quick, quick!

CAP Did we save the Cerritos?

MAR Working on it.

RUTH Ooh, I got it.
One illegal virus.

But someone has
to take it to the ship.

MAR But who's small enough
to go undetected?

BOIM Yeah, and who could survive
in space without a ship?

TEN Someone who can travel
with the program safely stored

in her hard drive.

Peanut Hamper!

You can load the code
into their ship

using your robotic abilities.

Oh, my gosh, Peanut Hamper,

you're gonna save the day!

PHAMP Eh, I'm gonna pass.

TEN I-I'm sorry, what?

PHAMP All that stuff sounded
way too scary.

What about
"the needs of the many"?

I joined Starfleet
to piss off my dad,

not to be a virus bomb.

MAR Peanut Hamper,
this is not cool!

BOIM - We're all going to die!
RUTH - Peanut Hamper!

There are so many lives
at stake!

PHAMP You know what? I'm just going
to beam myself out

of this whole sitch.

Sucks to be organic.

Enjoy having all your guts
fly out or whatever!

TEN You know what?
Peanut Hamper is a stupid name!

T'ANA That little.

RUTH Oh, my gosh. I'm back! I just
clicked myself back to normal.

Let me just upload this. Whoa!

Ugh, feels like
an ice cream headache.

Okay. Now I just need
to get on that ship.

TEN Wait, no! I-It's too dangerous.

You must be
in a heroic bravery mode

or something.
Keep clicking your button.

L-Let me click it.
Click-click your button.

RUTH No, Tendi, this is normal me.

- I've got this.
SHAX - And I've got you.

TEN Rutherford!

RUTH You know
I can run on my own.

SHAX This is the best day of my life!

- Eat this!
RUTH - No, no, no, no, no!

Linked up. Come on, come on.

Virus downloaded.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, y...

Download slowing to a crawl?

- Wait, why?
BAD - Sorry, but no virus

until after these guys kill you.

RUTH - What? Why?
BAD - Because you snapped my neck!

SHAX - What's the holdup?
RUTH - Damn it, Badgey,

we don't have time for this,
okay? Do it now!

BAD You want me to disable
their systems?

Fine. I'll do it...

explosively!

RUTH He's gonna blow us up!

SHAX Not if I have something
to scream about it.

BAD Stop it! He's mine!

SHAX Hang in there, baby bear!

BAD Ah, there we go.

BOIM Ah, they did it!
They got clear of the blast.

Bringing main power
back on line.

RAN All invaders have been...

Neutralized.

CAP As soon as the engines

are back on line,
get us the hell out of here.

And hey, don't get
too comfortable in my chair.

MAR Yes, sir.

BOIM No, no, no, no,
there's more of them!

PAKLEDS We have you now, Enterprise.

MAR All hands to escape pods.

Prepare to abandon ship.

BOIM Wait. Incoming ship?

It's the Titan!

PAKLEDS Oh, no! It's another Enterprise.

RIKER Red alert! A Pakled party,
and I wasn't invited?

MAR It's about time
you showed up, Will.

RIKER Mariner? This makes us even.

BOIM - You know Riker?
MAR - Yeah.

Who do you think hooks me up
with all my contraband?

Dude is flush with Romulan ale,
illeg...

TROI - I'm sorry, what was that?
RIKER - Uh...

We're still at red alert.
Target those ships and fire!

TROI We're talking about this later.

RIKER Make us go.

Go, guys, go!

They're retreating! Yes!

CAP No, no,

I don't want
any cosmetic changes

- to the Cerritos.
ENGINEER - Are you sure?

Because I could add some jazzy
reflective panels and big...

CAP No. I hate it
when a ship gets repaired

and comes out looking
all Sovereign-class.

I want her to look
almost like she usually does.

PART FOUR 

TEN All right,

we have a good one today.

Fluidic systems
and how to reroute them.

RUTH Fluidics are so messy.

TEN Rutherford, you're awake. Oh!

- I knew you'd be okay!
RUTH - What?

- What happened?
TEN - You saved the Cerritos!

RUTH Oh, I did? Wow!
That's pretty cool.

- Are you my nurse?
TEN - Nurse?

No, they just have been
giving me time off

so I could sit with you.

RUTH Oh, sweet. Nice to meet you.

I'm Rutherford.

TEN Oh, your implant.

I-It must have damaged
your long-term memory.

Do you remember me at all?

RUTH Well, no.
But don't take it personally.

I don't remember
what I don't remember.

TEN You know what this means, right?

We get to become best friends
all over again!

RUTH Okeydokey.

CAP We'll never forget
Lieutenant Shaxs' sacrifice.

He's with the Prophets now.

I can't even begin to imagine

- how I'm going to replace him.
MAR - Well,

wherever he is, I'm sure
he's full-throat screaming

in someone's face
and ejecting a warp core.

CAP I'd like to think you're right.

Ensign Beckett Mariner,

beamed down to Beta III
without authorization.

MAR Oh, what, seriously?

CAP Contraband hidden
throughout the ship.

Illegal weapons,
illicit drugs, a tribble?

MAR Yeah. That's for personal use.

CAP I've got a whole year's worth

of your insubordinations
right here.

MAR Well, without
those "insubordinations,"

- we'd all be dead right now.
CAP - I know.

Did you know Starfleet considers
Beta III a known culture?

They had no idea
the Betans had regressed.

And the Pakleds? Well,

the Pakleds murdered
the entire crew of the Solvang

because everyone assumed
they were a joke.

MAR Yeah, well, that's Starfleet.

Good at observing
and bad at maintaining.

You know, we can't just assume
people are gonna keep doing

the right thing
a generation down the road.

CAP I agree. But as captain,

I can't ignore protocol.
I'd lose my command.

You, on the other hand...

You see a problem,
you can solve it.

MAR Wait, are you saying
work together for a change?

CAP Might be useful to have a
captain on your side, you know?

Instead of up your ass.
What do you say?

MAR Uh, I think we're both
getting thrown in the brig.

CAP Let's not tell your father.

RUTH Oh, that's Mariner.
We work with her. Mariner!

- Over here! Hi.
RIKER - Carol.

I guess those Cali class ships

can hold their own
longer than people say.

CAP Thanks for the assist, Captain.

RIKER No need to be so formal.
You know, I was her mentor.

Uh, yeah, well,
I remember it differently.

You were sort of my cha'Dich.

We used to get
in so much trouble.

CAP - "We"?
RAN - Deanna,

can you introduce me
to any of your Betazoid friends?

TROI Jack, I sense
you exaggerate your confidence

in order to mask
an ocean of insecurity.

RAN Oh! Will they sense that, too?
I can make that work for me.

RUTH Wait, wait, wait, wait,
you made a dog?

TEN Yeah, and it could fly.
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

 And another time,
we stole bunch of T-88s.

RUTH Aw, man! The scanners
with the purple stripe?

Those are amazing.
What else did we do?

BOIM I just wanted to say,
I was wrong.

I'm glad
we followed our guts today.

You are my mentor.

MAR Whatever, nerd. Come on,

we can hang
without me being your mentor.

BOIM - I thought you wanted that.
MAR - Eh, my target kind of moves.

BOIM Well, from now on, no more
being obsessed with rank.

Time to start appreciating
what I have right here.

MAR Hey, you know what?
I like this new Boimler.

RIKER Good work today, Boomler. Ransom
says you're one of his best.

BOIM Thank you, Captain Riker, sir!

RIKER Hey, how about
you buy me a drink?

You know, since we're even?
Remember?

The thing with the aliens
where I saved your ass?

BOIM We are not
even, and we don't use money.

What's happened to you, man?
You used to be sharp.

MAR Boimler,
you backstabbing little weasel!

Yeah, next time I see you,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

I cannot believe
that you took a promotion

to the mother Titan!
Call me.

TITAN CREWMAN Hey, Brad. We got to scoot.

So get your boots
and strap 'em up,

'cause the captain wants us

to escort Commander Troi
to Tulgana IV.

Ooh, I hear
the Klingon district's intense.

BOIM There's a bar in Andoria Town
you guys would love.

TITAN CREWMAN Whoa, you've been there?

BOIM Yeah. I can show you around
if you want.

TITAN CREWMAN Dude, your PADD is blowing up.
Who is messaging you?

She's just an old friend.
She kind of got mad

when I took the promotion here.
Eh, she'll get over it.

MAR Boimler! You
can't keep ducking me forever.

It is a really small galaxy
out there.

Sooner or later, I'm gonna run
into you, and I'm gonna feed you

- to an Armus! You hear me?
JEN - Hey, psycho, keep it down.

- We're trying to sleep.
MAR - Oh, shut up, Jen.

I'm sorry I'm late.

RIKER I was watching
the first Enterprise

on the holodeck.
You know, Archer and those guys?

What a story.
Those guys had a long road

getting from there to here.

BOIM Course set
for the Tulgana system, Captain.

Awaiting your command.

RIKER Ah, Tulgana IV.

You know,
they have a Little Risa.

TROI Oh, so then should we take
the little horga'hn?

RIKER No. Let's take
the one we always use.

Right. Give me warp

in the factor
of five, six, seven, eight.

TROI Oh, the jazz.

THE END
