An orphan with an abnormally high intelligence, Charlie claims to have been raised entirely by computers in an isolated, automated outpost. Yeoman Janice Rand takes a particular interest in befriending the strange boy, and he responds, developing a romantic attachment to the woman. When Rand gently dismisses his affections as puppy love, however, Charlie's love quickly turns to rage. The boy begins to unleash highly destructive mental powers, which he had previously hidden, against all who he feels have slighted him, and Captain Kirk must find a way to stop the child before he and the Enterprise are destroyed.",93%,92%,256,24,

<html dir=""ltr"" lang=""",N/A,Where No Man Has Gone Before,"The series' second pilot episode (following the then-unaired ""The Cage"") is an extraordinary science fiction-adventure for its time. The starship Enterprise, commanded by Capt. James Kirk (William Shatner), is about to probe outside of the galaxy when they encounter an old-style disaster buoy from a spaceship listed as missing for two centuries. Examining its memory banks, they find that the ship encountered an unknown form of energy at the galaxy's edge, which precipitated a frantic search for information in their computer about paranormal mental powers and the captain's ordering of the destruction of his own vessel. The Enterprise proceeds on course and hits the same energy barrier, escaping with its main drive disabled, nine crewmen dead, and First Officer Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) mutating as a result of contact with the barrier. With the ship now years from any Federation base as a result of its disabled drive, the crew finds itself with a monster aboard. Mitchell quickly manifests extraordinary mental powers and an increasing contempt for the crew around him. Science Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) warns that Mitchell will soon be a threat to all of them, while psychiatrist Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman), who is in love with him (and, as later revealed, is also mutating from the energy blast), defends Mitchell as a potentially improved, evolved version of humanity. Kirk at first cannot face the choice that he knows he must make, of leaving his oldest friend marooned on an uninhabited planet that may also have the facilities to repair the main engines. Finally, Mitchell forces his decision when he turns on Kirk and the crew with mental powers they can't combat.",93%,92%,256,24,

The episode harked back to the classic 1990 Next Generation season-ender ""Best of Both Worlds,"" wherein the insidious Borg took over the mind and shape of Captain Jean-Luc Picard to launch an attack on the Federation. Three years later, Benjamin Sisko, survivor of the Borg attack, is assigned as commander of Deep Space Nine, a run-down former Cardassian space station in Bajoran territory. Sisko's first assignment is to oversee repairs of Deep Space Nine, but as the story progresses, he finds that he has been predestined to repair the tattered remnants of Bajor's ruined economy.

Needless to say, finding the vampire aboard the ship is easier said than done. Its shape-shifting ability has also allowed it to temporarily incapacitate McCoy, whose ignorance of events nearly costs Kirk his life.",93%,92%,256,24,

The starship Enterprise, commanded by Capt. James Kirk (William Shatner), is about to probe outside of the galaxy when they encounter an old-style disaster buoy from a spaceship listed as missing for two centuries. Examining its memory banks, they find that the ship encountered an unknown form of energy at the galaxy's edge, which precipitated a frantic search for information in their computer about paranormal mental powers and the captain's ordering of the destruction of his own vessel. The Enterprise proceeds on course and hits the same energy barrier, escaping with its main drive disabled, nine crewmen dead, and First Officer Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) mutating as a result of contact with the barrier. With the ship now years from any Federation base as a result of its disabled drive, the crew finds itself with a monster aboard. Mitchell quickly manifests extraordinary mental powers and an increasing contempt for the crew around him. Science Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) warns that Mitchell will soon be a threat to all of them, while psychiatrist Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman), who is in love with him (and, as later revealed, is also mutating from the energy blast), defends Mitchell as a potentially improved, evolved version of humanity. Kirk at first cannot face the choice that he knows he must make, of leaving his oldest friend marooned on an uninhabited planet that may also have the facilities to repair the main engines. Finally, Mitchell forces his decision when he turns on Kirk and the crew with mental powers they can't combat.",93%,92%,256,24,

After the obligatory introductions of the new crew of the Enterprise, the starship sets sail for the planet Daneb IV, for the purpose of investigating the new Farpoint starbase. Halfway to their destination, the crew is captured by obstreperous alien life form ""Q"" (John de Lancie) and placed on trial for all the crimes previously committed by the Human Race. One of the stars of the original Star Trek makes a surprise appearance in octogenarian makeup (Hint: He doesn't get to say, ""He's dead, Jim"").
