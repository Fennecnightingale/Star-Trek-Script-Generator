PART ONE

GAR A ship in trouble
making a forced landing, sir.

SPK It comes from
the Talos star group.

Their call letters check
with a survey expedition.

PKE My name is Christopher Pike,

commander of
the space vehicle

Enterprise.

Our destination is
the Talos star group.

Theres a canyon to the left.

We can set you down there
completely unobserved.

VINA I think its time to show
the captain our secret.

TAL This is Vina.

Her parents are dead. She was
born almost as we crashed.

SPK This is all some sort of trap.

PKE Are you real?

VINA Perhaps they made me
out of dreams youve forgotten.

PKE Is there any way I can keep them
from probing my mind,

from using my thoughts
against me?

VINA I cant help but love you.

SPK Lets get back
to the ship.

VINA I cant.

I cant go with you.

PKE Personal log,
Captain Christopher Pike.

Stardate 1532.9.

Still no word
from Commander Burnham,


 


but I know she wont give up

until she finds
her brother Spock.

As much as it pains me
to think the worst

of any Starfleet division,

I do hope she locates him
before Section 31 does.

COM ...is restricted
to all unauthorized personnel

until further notice.

PAT It is critical
Lieutenant Spock

be apprehended
as soon as possible.

And by fleeing
with her brother,

Commander Burnham has committed
yet another act of mutiny.

LEL I accept full responsibility
for our security lapse.

PAT As you should.
Spocks foreknowledge

of these signals appearing
around the galaxy

and his interactions
with the Red Angel

constitute vital intelligence.

ANDO Are you tracking their shuttle?

LEL We had a lock on its trajectory
for only minutes

before it was lost.

GRG Burnham disabled
her transponder.

PAT Shes smart. 
GRG I expect shell
obscure her warp signature

to keep us from
regaining a trace.

PAT She cant hide forever.

GRG Spocks in need of vital
medical intervention.

That limits their
potential destinations.

Any chance of you
getting us a list

of off-planet Vulcan
medical facilities?

PAT Controls threat-analysis system
will prioritize those.

Any other
suggestions?

LEL I believe that we should...

PAT I was asking Captain Georgiou.

GRG Since you asked,
I would put out

a Federation-wide alert
for Burnhams shuttle,

but exclude
Discovery.

TEL Exclude

Discovery?

Why?

GRG We dont want
personal entanglements

complicating the search.

If Burnham were to
reach out to anyone,

it would be Pike.

Lets listen for it
but not tip our hand.

PAT Excellent observation.

Captain Leland, you have an
agent on Captain Pikes ship?

LEL Specialist Tyler is on board, yes. 
PAT Good.

Because if Burnham communicates
with

we need to know.

Keep us informed.

GRG All of this reliance on

computerized threat analysis
bothers me.

In my universe,
the artificial intelligence

took orders from me,
not the other way around.

LEL Really?

And how did that
work out for you?

Why dont you whip up a
good reason for

to stand down and relay
the orders to them,

since youre on a roll.

MAN Encryption protocol verification

has been ordered for all...

GRG Well find Spock
and Burnham, of course,

and theyll have a lovely time
answering many, many questions.

In the meantime,
since you

felt it necessary
to destroy that probe,

we'd like you to comb
through the debris field

to find any remains that
could help us understand

what it was made from

and why it accessed
your computers.

That kind of thing.

PKE Are you sure Commander Burnham

received the hails
from your ship

and that she deliberately
ignored them?

GRG Why would I lie?

ASH Michael always has a logical
motivation for her actions.

Believe me,
I know her well.

GRG No matter how
you may feel about her,

she is aiding and abetting
a murder suspect.

PKE Who also happens
to be her brother.

There are many different
approaches here.
Discovery 

can be
a more valuable asset.
GRG Discoverys

value lies
in gathering more intel

on the probe.

Oh, and if Burnham
checks in,

we need to know
immediately, okay?

Im really busy.

PKE All right. My tolerance for
discretion has worn very thin.

What, exactly,
is your relationship

with Michael Burnham?

ASH Its 100% professional, sir.

PKE And has that always
been the case?

Mr. Tyler,

you and I have been through
a lot together recently.

I'm giving you the benefit
of the doubt,

and Im asking that you do
the same with me.

ASH I was in love with Michael,

and she was... not entirely
disinterested in me.

But I violated
her trust.

I wasn't the person she thought
I was, so she... moved on.

PKE I apologize, Mr. Tyler, but...

Im responsible
for a lot of lives here.

Your feelings could impact
our mission.

ASH They won't.

Permission to be
excused, Captain.

COMP One of 11 planetary bodies,

Talos IV was a warp-capable
M-Class planet

with a thriving population,

until several thousand
years ago,

when nuclear war caused
a near-extinction-level event.

A small population of
the indigenous species remains,

possessing susceptive
psychogenic abilities.

Travel within the Talos system
is prohibited by Starfleet.

BRN Were approaching
Talos IV.

Whatever it is youre
looking for, I hope we find it.

COMP Warning.
Now entering restricted space.

Warning.

Shuttle entering critical orbit.

BRN Correct course.

Computer, reverse
starboard impulse engine

and engage warp drive.

Spock!

It's a black hole.
Well be crushed.

COMP Structural failure
in five seconds.

Four. Three.

Two. One.

BRN Was that an illusion?

No, it was a test.

Were really on
the other side of

the looking glass now,
arent we?

STA So, uh, not much
has changed.

Should feel
pretty familiar.

HUGH More or less.

STA Anyway, I think
we should, uh,

take full advantage
of this opportunity.

You wouldn't believe how much
personal time I have saved up.

HUGH Yes, I would.

You spent every
waking moment in your lab,

weekends, nights.

STA Great, so, uh, looks like
your memorys fully intact.

That's good news.

I was hoping
the first time you saw him

would be, uh...
I don't know, I...

I'm just glad were together.

Look, I'm gonna make
a formal request

to have Tylers quarters
moved to a different deck.

There's no reason you should
have to see his face every day.

Here we are. Home.

PKE Airiam, how we doing
on the datacore audit?

ARIM The probe used multiple
SQL injections,

but Ive yet to find
any compromised files.

SAR The list of facilities
you asked for, Captain.

PKE Thats more
than I thought.

All right, start with the
Quiliam Station in Beta Quadrant

and work your
way around.

ASH Quiliam?

Thats a Vulcan
hospital.

You're looking for
Spock and Burnham?

Georgiou made it
pretty clear we were

to concentrate on collecting
debris from the probe.

PKE And we are. The crew is on task.
Ensign Tilly,

care to bring Specialist Tyler
up to speed

on our probe search?

TLY Oh, yes, sir.

Come into my office.

ASH What's up?

TLY Okay, so this is
your Class-C mid-embrace

with a very unpleasant
and time-traversing cephalopod.

ASH What's that?

TLY Like a squid.

Here you are
post-self-destruct.

And so far, we have reclaimed
one metric ton of material,

all of which is
from your shuttle.

There are no probe parts.

ASH How is that possible?

PKE We dont know.

Point is, were doing our job.

If Section 31 wants us
to stay stationary, so be it,

but I won't ignore a crisis
involving my officers.

COMP Atmosphere: 18% oxygen,

75% nitrogen,

4.6% carbon dioxide.

Temperature:
24 degrees Celsius.

BRN I need to take
a look around.

Will you be okay here?

Turn.

Slowly.

VINA Who are you?

BRN Where I come from,

the one holding the phaser
asks the questions.

Are you Talosian?
VINA No.

Human, but a permanent resident.

Spock.

Its me.

Vina.

Don't you
recognize me?

What's happened to him?

BRN Who are you?

VINA Im an old friend
of Captain Christopher Pike.

Is-is Chris...

is he coming back, as well?

BRN Are you saying Captain Pike
and Spock have both

been here before?

VINA Well, in some ways,

Captain Pike never left.

I was a crew member
on a survey ship

that crashed here
when I was young.

Long ago.

The Talosians put me
back together.

That's the easiest way
to explain it.

BRN I'm Commander Michael Burnham.

VINA They welcome you, Commander,

and ask that
you join them

below the surface.

BRN They're speaking to you now?

VINA Beam down with Spock

so they can
examine him.

BRN What do you mean,
"examine"?

You brought us here
because you knew

the Talosians could help you.

Have you been in communication
with them?

VINA They assure you,

your shuttle will be safe here.

BRN Coordinates, please.

Computer, two to beam down.

PART TWO 

BRN Vina.

Are you real?

TLSN She is very real.

We apologize
for the difficulties

entering the atmosphere.

Material illusionis our primary form of defense.

BRN I'm beginning to
understand that.

Do you only speak
telepathically?

TLSN We will converse in
the ancient way if you prefer.

BRN Can you tell me
why, exactly,

he risked our lives
bringing us here?

TLSN OTHER The Vulcan
is experiencing time

as a fluid rather than
a linear construct.

Conventional logic
has not helped him

interpret
such an experience.

BRN He knew youd be
able to help him.

He knew that conventional
medical understanding

would be useless.

Should this variance continue,
he will lose his mind,

permanently.

What could have possibly changed
his experience of time?

TLSN It is easier
for us to show you

his thoughts than
explain them.

But we require
something in return.

TLSN OTHER The memory of what happened

between you and your brother
on Vulcan.

TLSN We wish to view
the entire conflict

between the two of you
during childhood.

The defining experience.

The wound you inflicted.

BRN You want to experience our pain?

Why? For your entertainment?

TLSN This is how we understand.
How we survive.

BRN Survive another way.

TLSN OTHER Your brothers sanity

will depend entirely
on your cooperation.

VINA It's better not to
resist, Commander.

They dive deeply
into our minds.

Our hopes.

Our memories,
our fears.

Even our dreams.

This is how they found me
after the crash.

They gave me the choice:

to live the rest of my life
as I am

or as I was.

You see? They're not
unnecessarily cruel.

And even though this may just be
a projection, it...

...it feels as real as it looks.

TLSN OTHER To reorder your brothers mind,

we must disengage him
from logic.

But you must pay the price.

TLSN We may watch you
relive your memory?

BRN Yes.

But I need to see
my brothers mind first.

TLSN Very well.

SPK It began the night
you ran away from our home.

Deep into the forests
of Vulcans Forge

and its many dangers.

That is when the Angel
first appeared to me.

I thought it was a dream,
a premonition.

It showed me...

...your death.

I told Mother and Father where
I had seen you in the forest.

They found you.

The Angel saved you.

She changed your fate.

Years later,
it appeared to me once again.

Another dream,
another premonition.

I now understand its meaning.

And where it must lead me.

It guided me to a remote planet

and showed me...

the end.

My mind

to your mind.

BRN My thoughts to your thoughts.

SPK Now you see.

STA Dinner is served.

Computer,
music, please.

HUGH You kept all my things.

STA Well, I-I thought about, uh,
sending stuff to your mom.

I tried to pack it.

It was too hard.

I wasn't ready, I guess.

Here, um, first course.

Asopao. Your recipe.
Is it good?

HUGH Yeah, I-I guess, its just...

Its just unfamiliar.

STA Its your favorite.

HUGH I have that memory.

It's just, my-my
senses, my feelings

dont connect with it.

Or anything, really.

STA I-I think
wh-what youre dealing with

is-is a-a form
of neutralizing shock.

HUGH Its not that simple, Paul.

STA It's not a matter of identity,

because we know who you are.

HUGH Or maybe thats just who I was.

STA I-I think we should try
to normalize...

HUGH What's normal about this?

You never put together dinner
in our quarters before.

STA I'm just trying to help.
Ill do anything.

Please tell me how...

HUGH I don't know what to do!

You keep pushing me
to feel something!

You want me to just
pick up where we left off

as if nothing happened?
You have no idea!

STA Look, uh,

losing you was-was the worst
thing that ever happened, but...

but now that youre here again,
Im-Im just trying to treat it

like what it is: a miracle

that I dreamed about
every night

since you...

HUGH Since I died.

Say it!

STA Why are you so angry with me?

HUGH You know what, Paul?

That's a good question.

PKE Mr. Tyler, this is my ship.

More importantly,
this is my crew.

I will not call off the search.

I will not leave two
of them out there.

Certainly not when one
is accused of crimes

I don't believe he committed.

When were not
in our right minds,

ASH Captain,

we're capable of anything.

PKE I can believe that about you.

Not about Spock.

ASH It doesn't matter
what you believe.

31 believes hes a killer.

You may find them first,
but you won't get to them first.

Section 31
is watching you.

Not just Leland and Georgiou,
but their whole operation.

PKE Do you think you're surprising
me with this information?

ASH When Leland reaches Spock
and Burnham, he will bury them.

search only
shines a light on her.

PKE What are you saying?

ASH Trust Michael to find
the right way through.

Ultimately, its the safer
choice for both of them.

PKE If you trust Burnham

more than Section 31,

why are you working for them?

ASH I know they act in gray areas,

and I know
they're dedicated people

trying to keep you

and every other part
of the Federation safe.

After what Ive been through,
after what Ive become,

I can be of service there.

SAR Captain,

may I have a moment?

PKE Walk with me.

SAR It appears someone on our ship
accessed the transceiver array

and sent out an encrypted,

unauthorized subspace
transmission.

Three of them, actually.

Large bursts.
Petabytes of data.

PKE An unauthorized
transmission? Where?

SAR Unknown, sir.

PKE Not just anyone can
access that array.

There must be some
trace of the sender.

SAR Well, if there is, sir,
we will find it.

BRN Spock.

You saw the Red Angel.

First as a child,

then again a few months ago.

Who is it?

SPK If I knew,
we would not be here.

BRN I was asking rhetorically.

SPK Then at least ask something
I have never asked of myself.

BRN Can we have a better version
of this conversation?

SPK Is there a valuable question
in your arsenal?

BRN Yes. Do you actually think
the beard is working?

BRN The barren planets...
Andoria, Earth.

Is the Angel a time traveler?

SPK The engineering
comprehension

necessary to build its suit
would suggest so.

And some of the memories
it shared with me

have yet to occur.

BRN There was no one left.

SPK A possible future.

One that could well be
determined by our actions.

Yours and mine.

BRN Yeah, yours and mine.

Spock, there is
so much that I...

SPK No. I am not here
to absolve you, Michael Burnham.

This is not about your feelings.

BRN Guess Im a fool
for taking that personally.

SPK Agreed.

BRN I risked everything
to bring you here.

SPK It does not surprise me
that you see it that way.

But it was I
who brought you here

to see what I have seen.

BRN How does my seeing help you?

SPK I required someone who had
context of my timeline.

Of me.

BRN So you required family.

SPK An interesting choice of words,

coming from you.

Shall we continue?

There is a great responsibility
at hand.

BRN To serve the needs of the many.

I'm listening. Talk.

SPK An impermeable layer of energy
surrounding the suit.

A quantum field
I was unable to infiltrate.

Still, the thoughts I received
from within it were human.

BRN Human?

SPK There was loneliness,

desperation.

You will need to see more.

VINA Our hosts will attempt
to safeguard your mind

if you continue.

But if you need
to rest before...

BRN No, I dont.
Show me.

PART THREE

PSY Mr. Spock,
theres been an event.

Signals in space seen
across the galaxy.

The pattern is undeniably
what you previously described.

And what you are drawing here.

They're real.

SPK My vision wasnt
a hallucination?

PSY "Premonition" might be
a more accurate word.

SPK Then the images I saw
in the mind meld...

these signals...

PSY Somehow, you reported them
before they appeared.

What do you think they are?

SPK I believe they represent
an attempt to communicate.

PSY By whom?

Perhaps these signals
have appeared before.

Somewhere else?

As a Starfleet science officer,
you would have been exposed

to a comprehensive
historical...

SPK History will not provide
an answer to your query, Doctor.

Instead, you should be
asking me...

how is it I can
remember tomorrow?

It was a mistake to come here.

I must leave.

PSY Mr. Spock, leaving
would be premature.

There are Section 31 officers
coming to transfer you

to a more specialized facility.

SPK Section 31?

PSY Your mind is in crisis.

The Vulcan part of you
requires time to heal.

SPK You are correct.

Time most certainly has
something to do with it.

BRN What happened after that?

Section 31 thinks
you murdered these people.

SPK I see your faith
in my character has not changed

since we were children.

You are inside my mind,
yet you still need confirmation.

Do you see murder here?

ASH I'm sorry.

I dont expect you
to understand,

but...

it wasn't really me.

HUGH It was Voq.

ASH  Yes.

HUGH Bring him out.

ASH It doesn't work like that.

HUGH I can find him.

SAR This must be allowed
to play out.

TLY Are you sure about that?

ASH Stop it.

Stop! Stop, you...

HUGH Bring him out!

I dont even know
who I am anymore.

ASH Who do you think
you're talking to?

PKE You allowed the fight
to proceed?

SAR Well, I believe the
confrontation was

a necessary and
unavoidable catharsis

for both men.

PKE But hardly an example
of by-the-book

conflict resolution.

SAR The Starfleet manual offers
no regulatory guidelines

for interactions
between humans

with Klingons grafted
to their bones

and a ships doctor
returned from the dead.

PKE Then, occasionally,

we have to make it up
as we go along.

SAR That is the situation
in which we find ourselves, yes.

PKE This is not intended
with any judgment, Mr. Saru,

but I suspect that,
before your own evolution,

you might have made
a different call.

SAR Perhaps, Captain.

PKE Given the unusual nature
of our circumstances,

I'm going to overlook
the incident,

but this can't happen again.

And please make sure
everyones aware that

we will not be settling
our differences with violence,

but with the uniform
code of contact.

And that goes
for you as well.

SAR Understood, Captain.

PKE Good.

Vina.

Vina.

H-How...

VINA I'm not used to you
being afraid of me.

PKE Used to me?

VINA It's a lot to digest.

There's something
I need to say.

When you came to Talos,

I'd been alone
for so many years.

I never imagined
happiness or love.

And when the Talosians
decided we were

unsuited for each other...

when you left, it was worse.

Because I knew what I'd lost.

PKE I've thought about you-
us- often,

and wished that you
would have come with me.

VINA Chris, I didn't need to.

That's what Im trying to say.

They brought you
back to me.

Not the real you-
its illusory, of course-

but the part of you that
still lives inside of me.

We've spent a lifetime together.

PKE I'm glad...

I'm glad youre not alone.

VINA All this time, you kept me sane.

Kept me tethered
to what I once felt.

Even though I was never
the person you thought I was.

PKE You didn't deceive
anyone, Vina.

I felt it, too.

But you're here now.

This is real.

VINA As real as it
needs to be.

But the Talosians ability to
project illusions across space

is limited.

And the farther
away you are,

the harder it is
to sustain.

There's someone you need to see.

PKE Burnham.

You're on Talos?

Can you see me?

BRN Yes, Captain.

I found Spock.

He directed us here
so the Talosians

could show me his mind.

The first thing
I need to tell you is

Spock is innocent.

There were no murders.

I didnt want to communicate
through subspace.

Section 31 might have
traced our transmission.

I know what happened.
Georgiou reported

that she tried
to hail your shuttle

while Spock was on board
and you failed to respond.

BRN I took Spock to Captain Leland,
and he tried to use

invasive Terran technology
to rip his mind apart.

PKE But why? What do they
want with Spock?

SPK My memories of the future.

PKE Spock... it is good to see you.

SPK Captain, I have seen
the Red Angel,

and it revealed the final
outcome of our current timeline.

If we are to escape
what awaits us,

we must follow
the Angels design.

PKE What design?

VINA Please, the window
is closing.

SPK Captain,

I never believed I would
ask this of anyone,

but I need you
to take me on faith.

You must come
for us now, if you can.

VINA Chris, hurry.

We're out of time.

Hurry for your friends.

They're counting on you.

STA You should at least...

at least get your hand
checked out.

HUGH Why?

I-I can feel it.

And Im not letting anyone
fix things I can feel.

STA Look, just come home and...

HUGH Its not my home anymore, Paul.

That version of me

that called your quarters home,
that version of me is dead.

And I'm not going back.

STA But is it because

you don't want to or...

because you don't know how?

HUGH What difference does it make?

Would you please
just move forward?

And let me do the same.

STA I, uh...

Okay.

MAN Commander Stamets to Engineering.

PKE Engineering, status, please.

NIL Commander Stamets
is just getting

into position now,
Captain.

STA Whats our destination, Captain?

PKE Talos IV.

OWO Captain.

Talos is in a restricted section

of the Alpha Quadrant.

PKE Yes, it is.

Hit it, Airiam.

ARIM The spore drive
just disengaged, sir.

Whats going on down there?

NIL It appears to be a failure
in the spore hub.

TLY Sir, Im seeing corruption
in duotronics.

Corruption that seems
to have been

introduced manually
somehow.

PKE Have there been previous
corruption issues with the hub?

TLY Not like this.

We run level-three diagnostics

on the entire spore drive
every ten hours.

Someone deliberately
corrupted the system.

ASH Why the black alert?

PKE We have to get
to Talos IV

to retrieve Spock
and Burnham.

But our spore drive
has conveniently gone down,

and it wasn't an accident.

ASH You think someone
tampered with it?

Who? Who would do that?

NAHN Well, we might be able
to narrow down the list

by asking who had a vested
interest in keeping us here.

SAR And someone on our ship
has been sending

unauthorized, heavily encrypted
subspace transmissions

to unidentified
recipients.

ASH I don't know anything about

unauthorized transmissions.

SAR Odd.

They were authorized
by your command codes.

ASH I sent nothing.

To no one.
Someone must have

spoofed my code. 
NAHN And
sabotaged the spore drive.

ASH You don't really think I...

PKE I've recently
learned that

Section 31 has accessed
invasive neurologic tech.

Maybe they used it on you.

NAHN Maybe you dont even
know youre doing it.

ASH That part of my life is over.

I'm sure I-Id know
if I did something like that.

PKE Im sorry, Tyler.

I can't afford to take
your word for it.

And neither can you.

Have him confined
to his quarters

until further notice.

ASH Trust me on this,
if nothing else:

Section 31 will find
a way to track you.

PKE Thank you, Mr. Tyler. I agree.

Set a course
for Starbase 11

at maximum warp.

DET Aye, sir.

PKE Radio ahead.

Say that
we need repairs.

RHYS Aye, Captain.

Maybe thatll throw off
any potential pursuers.

SAR Starbase 11 is two light-years
from Talos IV.

PKE Exactly why I want

Section 31 to think
that were going there.

We'll pick a point midway,

alter course
and then run silent.

That should buy use enough time.

I hope.

(Ariams eyes flash red)

BRN Thank you...

for helping Spock.

I'm pretty sure
he would have died

without your help.

VINA Discovery will be here soon.

There isn't much time.

BRN I owe them my memory.

VINA You don't want them
to force payment.

Its awful.

SPK I've shown her
all the memories

she needs to see.

BRN Yeah, well...

...now you have to share
one of mine.

It's the price I agreed to
for your recovery.

SPK Michael, wait.

Michael, wait.

Where are you going?

Spock, Im a danger
to your family.

SPK Our family. No.

BRN There are too many Vulcans

who dont want
humans living here.

Father knows the
separatists aren't gone.

They'll come back
and attack your home.

SPK Our home.

We'll fight them.

Together.

BRN It's better this way.

You deserve to grow up
somewhere safe.

SPK Safe is a relative construct.

Safe has inconsistent meanings.

BRN Stop it.

SPK I am going.

Then I'm going with you.

BRN I don't want you with me.

Don't you understand that?

SPK You are my sister.

My sister...

You... you are helping the human
part of me learn to express...

BRN The human part of
you is so small

it won't make a difference
in your life.

Why can't you get it
through your head?

I dont want a freak
like you as a brother.

SPK But I love you.
BRN Love?

You're not capable of love.

SPK I am.

BRN No, you are not.

You are Vulcan,

and you will always be
cold and distant,

like a moon somewhere.

You're not worth my effort.

SPK But you promised you would
teach me the ways of Earth.

That maybe we could
live there one day.

BRN Don't you get it?

I don't want you in my life.

Stop following me...

...you weird little half-breed.

Spock, I didnt mean
any of those...

SPK I am aware you were
trying to sever

our emotional connection
so that I would be

less distraught
by your absence.

A primitive tactic,
but logical.

BRN No, it was more than that.

The Logic Extremists
would have targeted our family

as long as I was
still in that house.

I did not want you
to get hurt or killed.

But I should have
tried something else.

Anything else.

Spock,

I am so sorry.

SPK In point of fact,
I am grateful.

Your words showed me
how damaging

my humanity could be.

BRN No, your humanity
was beautiful.

I was a child.

SPK You were a catalyst.

In an attempt to
escape emotion,

to escape you,

I fully submerged in logic.

But my bedrock of
logic, my constant,

has always been time itself.

And now time has failed me.

Logic has failed me.

Emotion has failed me.

I have nothing to build upon,
yet build I must.

This could be
the defining moment

for multiple civilizations
and millions of lives,

and I am not ready.

BRN Are you more angry
with me or yourself?

SPK Do not attempt to
psychoanalyze me, Michael.

Better minds than yours
have tried and failed.

BRN Yet you chose me
for this journey.

You value our connection.

Perhaps the bedrock
of your logic

is this relationship.

SPK Absurd.

You are correct,
however,

on one matter.

It was foolish to idolize you.

And I regret it deeply.

VINA Discoverys

approaching.

There is another ship
close behind.

They want you to know
youre in danger.

PART FOUR 

BRY The Section 31 ship
is hailing, sir.

PKE Tylers confined.
They didn't find us through him.

Answer them, Bryce.

LEL I know where youre going, Pike.

Cut your engines immediately.
That's an order.

PKE I'll start following orders when
you start telling the truth.

Or did you not think
I'd find out

what you were going
to do to Spock?

LEL Last warning, Chris.

Stand down.

PKE Detmer, drop us in
over Talos IV.

Owo, the second were in range,
start scanning for our people.

OWO Got them, sir.

PKE Beam them up, quickly.

OWO Copy that, sir.

Achieving lock,
and beaming now.

And?

THR TRANS  I've locked on
with our transporter,

but Im getting interference.

RHYS Sir, Section 31

has a lock
on Burnham and Spock as well.

BRY Leland again, sir.

PKE Put him on.

LEL Pike, disengage your
transporter beam immediately.

PKE I cant do that.

LEL If one of us doesn't let go,

Burnham and Spock will be
ripped apart atom by atom.

Is that what you want?
Because that's exactly

what's going to happen
if you dont

disengage your transporter beam.

PKE Mute screen.

OWO What do I do, sir?

Captain?

VINA Let your friends go.

It's the only way.

Let them go.

Let us all go.

Trust me.

PKE Goodbye, Vina.

Owo...

disengage transporter.

OWO Yes, sir.

THR TRANS They've disengaged.
Beaming in now.

CREWMAN Do not move.

LEL You did the right thing.

That will be noted
in my after-action report.

Now, you and your crew
are to report to Starbase 11

and await disciplinary action.

Leland out.

GRG You look exceptionally
pleased with yourself.

Aren't you surprised
Pike gave up so easily?

LEL Thank you
for your insight.

Now, this time,
I'll do the talking.

BRY Captain, I detect a shuttle

approaching
from the planet.

OWO Trying to
scan it, Captain,

but something is
blocking us.

Should I hail them, sir?

PKE No.

They wouldn't want
to risk answering.

Let them in the shuttle bay.

Mr. Saru, with me.

LEL Welcome back, Commander.

What were you doing on Talos?

This will go easier
if you answer me.

Or it can go harder.

BRN I beg to differ.

Say goodbye, Spock.

SPK Goodbye, Spock.

LEL What is this?
What's happening?

BRN Captain.

Commander Saru.

SAR But how?

PKE Talosian projection.
Thats how.

SPK Greetings, Captain.

PKE Spock.

Are you all right?

SPK Much better for seeing you
in person, sir.

Even if we are only
riding into danger.

PKE Is that a smile
I see on your face?

SPK I believe it is. Yes.

PKE Well, welcome to

Discovery.

GRG Those Talosians tried
this trick with me

in the Terran universe once,

and I blew them
and their stupid singing plants

off the face of the planet.

LEL Well, you might have
told me about

the scope of their abilities.

GRG And miss seeing you explain
yourself to the admirals?

Oh, Leland, I wonder how
this will work out for you.

CREWMAN Captain on the bridge.

PKE Spock, I need to hear
about this Red Angel.

Do you know what it is?

SPK A human, and nothing more.

BRN It appears
this person is attempting

to change the outcome
of our current timeline.

PKE And what is that outcome?

SPK A future in which
all sentient life

in our galaxy
has been eradicated.

PKE By what?

SPK Unclear, Captain.

PKE Well, we should sure
alter course

and get the hell out of here.

PKE In just a few minutes.
SAR Discovery

will become

the most wanted ship
in the galaxy.

PKE I dont suppose the Red Angel
offered you any advice

on how to handle a
situation like this.

SPK No.

But my limited
experience

as a fugitive suggests
only one course of action.

And what is that?

We run.

PKE I can't ask any of you

to participate in what is
clearly an act of disobedience.

TLY Course heading, sir?

Does feel like

we should get moving, like, now.

BRN I think you have
the crew, sir.

PKE Helm, get us out of here.
