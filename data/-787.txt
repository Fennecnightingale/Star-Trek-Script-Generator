PART ONE
[INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER COMM]
TECH [OVER COMM]: Beaming to Enterprise.
TECH [OVER COMM]: Stand by.
TECH [OVER COMM]: Energizing.
NUMBER ONE: Highlighting the urgent need for the kind of quantum stochastic models of salvo analysis... Pause. Should be right... now.
NUMBER ONE: Resume. Proposed in this memorandum...
SPOCK: Sir, Ensign Spock, S179 276SP, reporting for duty.
NUMBER ONE: Welcome aboard, Ensign.
NUMBER ONE: How was your trip out to Starbase 40?
SPOCK: Uneventful, sir.
NUMBER ONE: No need to shout, Ensign Spock.
SPOCK: No, sir.
NUMBER ONE: You've been on this ship exactly 37 seconds, Ensign, and you haven't asked a single question.
NUMBER ONE: Not what I expect from a science officer.
NUMBER ONE: I expect you to barrage every crewman you meet with questions, starting with me, to the point you become an annoyance.
NUMBER ONE: You have until I reach that turbolift. Go.
SPOCK: What is your name, sir?
NUMBER ONE: Just call me Number One.
[DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN]
SPOCK: Sir, what is your opinion of the Onafuwa model of combat salvo analysis compared to the traditional neo-Wayne model?
NUMBER ONE: I find it problematic.
NUMBER ONE: Ensign, how would you like to see the bridge?
NUMBER ONE: Bridge.
NUMBER ONE: You had Onafuwa for Fundamentals of Quantum Stochastics and Advanced, One and Two, and seminar, and received top marks.
SPOCK: Indeed. I found it quite...
NUMBER ONE: Brutal?
SPOCK: Yes.
NUMBER ONE: Onafuwa's a monster, but such a brilliant monster. And of course the subject matter is...
NUMBER ONE: Fascinating.
SPOCK: Fascinating.
PART TWO
[RUMBLING]
COMPUTER [OVER SPEAKERS]: Computer error. Manual control unavailable.
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: Engineering.
NUMBER ONE: Upjohn, this is Number One.
NUMBER ONE: We have failure in turbolift six and I can't get manual override.
UPJOHN: On it, sir. Engineering out.
NUMBER ONE: People don't talk in elevators.
SPOCK: I've observed that, sir.
[SIGHS]
NUMBER ONE: This may take some time. Let's not waste it. Keep up the questions.
SPOCK: What are the three most salient facts about Captain Pike?
NUMBER ONE: One, his capacity for hearing out another point of view is exceeded only by his willingness to change his own once he's heard you out.
NUMBER ONE: Two, even though he is the most heavily decorated fighting captain in Starfleet, he views resorting to force as an admission of failure.
NUMBER ONE: And three... he is utterly unsentimental. Except when it comes to horses.
SPOCK: He is sentimental about large herbivorous terrestrial mammals?
NUMBER ONE: Just stay away from the topic, is my advice.
SPOCK: You have made a most careful study of the captain.
NUMBER ONE: Upjohn!
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: Sorry, sir, we're isolating the problem. It's either the secondary induction coil or a glitch in the path routing or the brakes. Definitely one of those three.
SPOCK: Which version of the O.S. are the ship's computers running?
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: 36.11.4.
NUMBER ONE: I took a look at the bosun sampling of code. 5. In my opinion, it...
SPOCK: Lacks elegance.
NUMBER ONE: Lacks elegance.
NUMBER ONE: Indeed.
SPOCK: Do the food synthesizers use the Gupta or the Katzman glucose matrix?
NUMBER ONE: We use the Una matrix.
NUMBER ONE: Essentially a Gupta-Katzman hybrid.
NUMBER ONE: It's more reliable then either and the results are both more nutritious and more palatable.
PART THREE
SPOCK: Your name is Una.
NUMBER ONE: That isn't a question, Ensign.
NUMBER ONE: My name is Number One.
SPOCK: Have you ever considered that the prime directive is not only not ethical, but also illogical, and perhaps morally indefensible?
NUMBER ONE: No, Spock, I have not, and for the sake of your own sanity, might I suggest you cease doing so immediately. Next.
SPOCK: Have you considered that the ubiquity of mathematical constants... such as "E" or the so-called golden ratio... decline of the universe was designed...
[NUMBER ONE SIGHS]
SPOCK: Perhaps an enormous simulation.
SPOCK: Am I becoming an annoyance?
NUMBER ONE: Just starting to get a bit heavy.
SPOCK: Do you like eggplant?
[SIGHS]
NUMBER ONE: Give me a boost, Ensign.
NUMBER ONE: You know. Hoist me up.
NUMBER ONE: On your knees, Spock.
[CLICKS]
NUMBER ONE: All right, it's unlocked.
NUMBER ONE: Upjohn, I opened the service hatch.
NUMBER ONE: What should I look for?
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: You'll want to move aside the fan housing.
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: You'll see a small black microbox and a blue diode.
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: Pull it out to see if the contacts are clean.
NUMBER ONE: All right. Next question, Spock.
SPOCK: Have you ever made firsthand observations of a triple-mode high-amplitude Delta Scuti star?
NUMBER ONE: Yes. My first deep-space cruise on Enterprise took us to within a half light-year of 99 Pegasi.
SPOCK: I am envious.
PART FOUR 
[EXHALES] 
NUMBER ONE: You should be.
NUMBER ONE: I can't begin to tell you what a spec... [SCREAMS]
UPJOHN [DISTORTED]: Number One, are you all right?
NUMBER ONE: I... I don't know what happened.
UPJOHN [DISTORTED]: Number One?
[GROANS] 
NUMBER ONE: We're fine.
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: Glad to hear it.
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: So, what we're gonna do, sir, is have Lieutenant Amin rappel down the turboshaft from deck nine.
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: She's a champion climber and she's ready to go.
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: Just as soon as we locate the belaying rig.
UPJOHN [OVER COMM]: Seems like nobody's seen it since the Ling Plateau rescue mission.
SPOCK: But I...
NUMBER ONE: Any more questions, Ensign?
SPOCK: No, sir. I am sorry.
NUMBER ONE: Fair enough.
NUMBER ONE: Then I have one for you.
NUMBER ONE: When you beamed aboard, Ensign, were you... smiling?
NUMBER ONE: I didn't know that was something Vulcans could do.
NUMBER ONE: I must admit, I found the sight a bit disconcerting.
SPOCK: Duly noted.
SPOCK: In the future, I will be careful to avoid smiling.
NUMBER ONE: No.
NUMBER ONE: The strength of a Starfleet crew is in its diversity and differences.
NUMBER ONE: I would never ask a crewmember to suppress or conceal their nature.
NUMBER ONE: I do think one must be aware, however, of how one is perceived by one's comrades.
NUMBER ONE: Not because you're half-Vulcan.
NUMBER ONE: But this is the advice I'd give to anyone whose ultimate goal is command.
SPOCK: That is not my goal, sir.
NUMBER ONE: Bullshit.
NUMBER ONE: No one endures two solid years of Onafuwa on quantum-stochastic combat modeling because they want to sling a tricorder for the rest of their lives.
NUMBER ONE: And if you want to command, you're gonna have to learn to keep your freaky to yourself.
NUMBER ONE: Even if that's painful.
SPOCK: I have been doing that all my life.
SPOCK: And it is.
NUMBER ONE: I know.
SPOCK: Do you?
SPOCK: Then that leads to a logical next question.
NUMBER ONE: All right, Ensign.
SPOCK: I'll show you.
[BOTH LAUGH]
[WHIRRING]
AMIN: It's Lieutenant Amin.
AMIN: Hang on, I'll have you out of there straightaway.
[QUIETLY] 
AMIN: I swear I heard her laughing in there.
NUMBER ONE: You will forget this.
NUMBER ONE: I want there to be a hole in your memory where this once was.
SPOCK: That is an order.
[WHISPERS]
NUMBER ONE: On your honor, as a Starfleet officer, Ensign Spock, swear.
SPOCK: I swear on my honor as a Starfleet officer, sir.
AMIN: Folks ready to go?
[INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER COMM]
PIKE: That the new boot?
NUMBER ONE: Yes.
PIKE: That'd be Ensign...
SPOCK: Spock, sir.
PIKE: Spock. At ease, Ensign.
SPOCK: Not my strong suit, sir.
PIKE: I understand.
PIKE: Do Vulcans ever feel awe, Spock?
SPOCK: They do, Captain. But they tend to keep it to themselves.
THE END
