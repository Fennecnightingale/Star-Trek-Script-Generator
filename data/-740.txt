PART ONE

BRN Make way!

Words define who we are.

Officer.

Orphan.

Widower.

Shipmate.

But there is no word
for the unique agony

of uncertainty.

I do not yet know
the fate of my friend.

Stamets refuses to lose hope.

He believes Tilly survived

whatever the alien
we call "May" did to her.

I want to believe
that's possible, too.

I want to have faith.

But in its absence,

only duty remains.

DET Captain, I've picked up the
trail of Spock's shuttle.

PKE Alter course to intercept.

OWO Spock's shuttle is
25,000 kilometers and closing.

One life sign detected.

RHYS His shields are up and
his weapons are hot, sir.

BRN What is Spock doing?

PKE Why the aggressive stance?

SAR Uh, Captain,
Spock departed Enterprise

before you assumed
command of Discovery.

Perhaps he is unaware
that he's among friends.

PKE Open a channel.
BRY - Aye, Captain.

PKE Lieutenant Spock,
this is Captain Pike.

Shut down your engines,
lower your shields,

prepare for transport.
OWO - He's increasing speed.

Altering course to
enter the nebula.

PKE Spock, you have my word.

I'm here to listen.
I'm here to help.

PKE Did we lose him?
DET - No, sir.

BRN He ignited the nebula's hydrogen
to disrupt our sensors,

then came to a full stop.

We flew right past him.
PKE - Detmer, come around.

BRN Captain, if he enters
the nebula, we will lose him.

PKE Target that shuttle
with a class-five torpedo.

Detonate it 100 meters
before impact. Understood?

RHYS Aye, Captain.
PKE - Fire.

BRN The shuttle's been
disabled, sir.

PKE Owo, lock on a tractor beam
and bring him aboard.

Burnham, with me.

COM Transfer operational control

to security team alpha.

NAHN Set phasers to stun.
CREWMAN - Aye.

PKE Nobody fires without my direct order.
CREWMAN - Aye, sir.

PKE Captain Georgiou?

GRG Captain Pike.

Michael.

PKE Commander.

GRG Quite the welcome, my dear.

PKE We met at the Academy.

Been a couple thousand
light-years since then.

GRG Indeed.

PKE You were a force to
be reckoned with.

Sharpest tool in the shed.

And despite being able to drink
any of us under the table,

you had every regulation
down by week two.

GRG You're tactfully asking

why I didn't identify myself
when you hailed.

PKE Identification is

standard procedure,
and that's a non-answer.

You haven't
lost a step, Captain.

GRG I appreciate the compliment.

PKE Starfleet records show...
you're retired.

GRG Do I look retired?

PKE You know, I had
a cousin like you.

She only ever gave a
straight answer in church.

So the only other explanation is

you're on a classified mission.

GRG Hmm.

PKE You like being
back in the saddle?

GRG It's an invigorating ride.

This may clear
things up, Captain.

BRN Section 31?
PKE Fancy.

Covert ops. Intelligence
gathering. Threat assessment.

GRG Fun times.
PKE - What do any of those things

have to do with you
being on Spock's shuttle?

GRG I've been authorized
to hunt down a Starfleet officer

wanted for murder.

Excuse me,

multiple murders.

By the time I caught up
to his craft,

it was adrift, and he was gone.

Any idea where he might be?

BRN If I hear anything, you'll
be the first to know.

GRG Will I?

PKE Commander Burnham
has a hard time

believing those charges;
so do I.

GRG The innocent don't run.
BRN - You ran from us.

GRG Exactly.

LEL Christopher.

PKE Leland.

LEL Is that gray hair I see?

PKE Yeah, well,
it's one of the trade-offs

of having actual hair.

Last time I heard about you,

you were up to your ass

in alligators on Cestus Three.

LEL Exactly why I transferred
to Starfleet Intelligence.

I'm heading up Section 31.

PKE Well, you were always
more comfortable

in the gray areas, my friend.

LEL Seems you've intercepted
one of my agents.

PKE Yeah, we've been
getting caught up.

LEL Well, I'd appreciate
if you'd return

Agent Georgiou to her shuttle.

Clock is ticking.

She's tracking
a suspected murderer.

PKE Mr. Spock
is one of mine.

I can't reconcile
the charges with the man.

LEL I respect that.

But having his commanding
officer or his sister

interfere with our
efforts to recover him?

Makes me look like
I'm doing an old friend a favor.

PKE Leland, um,

I think there may be
a connection

between Spock and the signals
that have been dragging us

halfway around the universe.

There are lives at stake.

LEL There are always lives at stake.
That's what keeps us employed.

See, we do what we do

so you can do what you do.

PKE If I didn't know you better,

that would sound like a threat.

LEL You know me pretty well.

I'll send a liaison.

If you could walk him
through what you know,

I'd appreciate it.

PKE Always happy to do a favor
for an old friend.

You're free to go, Captain.

GRG Your captain doesn't know
where I'm really from.

BRN I'm under direct
Starfleet orders.

GRG Yeah, to tell the truth
when it's convenient?

I'm learning to really like
Starfleet and Section 31.

BRN Do you think they'll
give you free reign, huh?

That place has eyes
on eyes on eyes.

GRG Well, it's a good thing
I do some of my best work

in plain sight.

BRN Does Leland have any idea
who you really are?

You mean the Terran Emperor,

Philippa Georgiou
Augustus Laponius Centarius?

He doesn't call me

by my proper name,
but yes, he does.

BRN Then I trust him
about as much as I trust you.

GRG You're the one who brought me
to this insufferable place.

You don't get to be
surprised I'm here.

And when I find Spock, I'll be
sure to pass along your regards.

BRN If you lay a hand
on my brother...

GRG You'll what?

Ah.

Now here's a woman I recognize.

BRN Shuttle bay's through there.

I'm sure you need to get back
to your... snake pit.

Tell me you have good news.

STA The universe never lets
anything go to waste,

or so said Lavoisier.

BRN The law of conservation of mass.
- Yes.

STA In chemical reactions,

mass is neither created
nor destroyed.

Look. Look, look, look.

I'm scanning the cocoon
for human remains.

Mitochondrial DNA,
lipids, proteins.

If all of Tilly's atoms

were transported,

rather than decomposed,

then there shouldn't be any
trace of her organic matter.

BRN Which would mean May took Tilly
into the network.

STA Which would mean

we could get her out.

BRN How?

STA I think that this cocoon
is an organic transporter.

Just like ours,

it-it breaks down
matter in one place

and then reassembles it,
completely intact, in another.

BRN The mycelial version
of a transporter pad.

Which could mean
that a second cocoon

just like this one
exists somewhere in the network.

But why take Tilly
in the first place?

May came here to deliver
a message to you.

STA May said she had
a special connection with Tilly.

She said she needed her.

Look.

No human material present.

Tilly's alive.
I know it.

BRN But the network is massive.
STA - Yes.

Except now that I know the exact
composition of this cocoon,

I can scan the network
to find its counterpart.

BRN Find it, find Tilly.

PART TWO

TLY Help me! Help me!

Oh, no!

Shh, shh, shh. Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off!

Shh, shh, shh, shh. Ow! My eyes! My eyes!

MAY Stay calm, Tilly.

You're okay. Don't you...
don't you shush me!

TLY What the hell did you do?
What did you do?

MAY Broke down your biological
form, transported it

across the dimensional plane,

and reconstituted it
here, in my home.

TLY Oh, that old trick!
Are you freaking kidding me?!

I'm in the mycelial network.

MAY It used to be a paradise.

MAY No!

This is the one
I was telling you about!

TLY Ow, it burns! It burns.

MAY Leave her!

It's our process.

TLY What does that mean?

MAY The JahSepp... we
break down all matter

that enter the mycelial network
to make it useful in new ways.

Like the insects
do on your planet.

It's how we keep the
life cycle progressing.

TLY This was you
before you were you.

MAY That's what I am.

I'm appearing like this
to make you comfortable.

TLY Comfortable?
You kidnapped me!

And I'm finding my way back!
MAY You can't.

TLY Watch me! Watch me!

And when I'm done, I'm not
gonna work through my anger.

I'm gonna let it sit there
and fester for eternity!

MAY Please. I need your help.

TLY You don't get to ask
for my help, May.

MAY Then who are we to turn to?

Who am I to turn to besides you?

There's no one, Tilly.

And I can't fail,
or everything here,

my entire species, will die.

TLY What do you need me to do?

MAY Kill a monster.

PIKE Burnham. Section 31's
liaison just got here.

COMP Attention all personnel.

Security drill in progress,
deck four.

PKE Burnham?

BRN It's nothing, sir.

He's, um...

he's-he's just supposed
to be on Qo'noS.

PKE He murdered an officer.

BRN Voq murdered an officer.

Ash Tyler's a good man.

PKE Even if I could see
my way to accepting

that distinction,
he left this ship

to serve as Torchbearer
for the Klingon chancellor.

Now he's into black ops.

BRN I know Tyler.

Better than most.

PKE Just like you knew
your former captain?

PKE She certainly doesn't seem like

the Philippa Georgiou
I remember.

BRN The war changed her.

PKE Call me provincial,
but I prefer people

whose truth I can take
at face value.

So...

what truth are you
keeping from me?

BRN Sir?

PKE That moment you saw Tyler,

the moment that you had
your phaser on Georgiou.

I don't know you very well,
but I know you well enough.

BRN It's a longer
conversation, Captain.

But I ask that you bear with me

until a more appropriate time.

PKE Done.

Just don't make me chase
after you for the information.

BRN Thank you, sir.

ASH It's good to see you.

BRN I feel the same.

ASH Not sure she does.

Your captain thinks
I need a babysitter.

BRN She's our new chief of security.

It's her job to be curious.

How the hell did you end up
with Section 31?

ASH It's a very interesting
journey, actually.

BRN Tell me.
ASH - But it's classified... A word that pops up

pretty frequently
in my new vocabulary.

BRN You always were
a man of secrets.

ASH Michael.

I had to leave Qo'noS.
I'm never going back.

I think... everyone at 31
thinks of it

as a place
where they make sense.

Not in spite of who they are
but because of it.

They can be of service.
They're good people.

BRN Like the Terran emperor?

I'm concerned for Spock's safety
as long as she's involved.

ASH I won't let that happen.

I need you to believe that.

BRN That's a really big ask, Ash.

ASH I know.

I'm supposed to report
to the bridge.

BRN Stamets is briefing us
on a plan to rescue Tilly.

ASH Rescue Tilly from where?

TLY Whoa. Whoa,
what happened here?

MAY The creature destroys
everything it touches.

TLY Wait, wait,
when did you first see it?

MAY It arrived when your Stamets
opened the door to our world.

TLY Doesn't make any sense.

MAY No, careful!

The tree bark contains
a vicious toxin.

It's lethal for us.

TLY Thank you.

MAY The creature uses the toxin
to slaughter us.

We have no tools

or weapons to defend ourselves.

TLY Well, you're far
from helpless, May.

The way you and I, uh...

I guess "met" is a funny word...
But it's some of

the most sophisticated science
I've ever seen.

I mean, you literally
entered my brain as a spore.

MAY Thank you.

I appreciate your mastery
of science as well.

TLY Let's go see
what we're dealing with.

But you...
you have to promise me

that you will get me
back on Discovery.

It's a little hard
to dive into this

knowing you plan on
holding me hostage forever.

PKE There's a chance
Ensign Tilly is still alive?

STA There is, sir.

She was taken
into the mycelial network

against her will.

PKE How do we get her back,
Mr. Stamets?

STA Every time we jump,

Discovery passes through
the mycelial network for...

a few milliseconds,

and during that
very brief window of time,

we are actually inside it.

I'm proposing we do

a partial jump.

ARIM A predetermined course
with no set end point? 
STA Exactly.

Half in, half out
of the network.

Discovery will hold
position long enough

for me to leave the cube
and find Tilly.

BRN For us

to leave the cube.

You're not gonna do this alone.

PKE Let's say I let you
use this ship as a doorstop.

Can we survive prolonged
exposure to the network?

STA The mycelia
will attack the ship,

decomposing it
as soon as we enter,

but tritanium is not
their favorite food,

so we'll have about an hour

before they
eat through the hull.

PKE That's an hour
to find Ensign Tilly.

So far, I hate this plan.

STA It'll be critical

for everyone
to avoid places on the ship

where mycelial space
and normal space intersect.

Anyone who touches the barrier
will find themselves

twisted around the axes
of both environments.

BRN Like the bodies we found

on the Glenn.

PKE From what I know
of that young woman...

she'd put her life on the line
for any one of us.

STA That she would, sir. 
BRN In a heartbeat.

PKE Bryce. Open a
ship-wide channel.

All personnel,
this is Captain Pike.

Starfleet... is a promise.

I give my life for you;
you give your life for me.

And nobody gets left behind.

Ensign Sylvia Tilly
is out there,

and she has every right
to expect us.

We keep our promises.

NAHN This way! Quickly!

Move, move! Move! 
PKE:
Please report to your stations

in designated safe zones
in the starboard section.

NAN Let's go, let's go!

PKE Good luck,

and Godspeed to us all.

BRN Commander Saru modified these

to maintain communication
with the bridge.

They now have special filters
to limit interference.

STA The reaction cube is

the only place on the
ship where it's safe

to contact the mycelial barrier.

PKE  Stamets,

are you ready to execute
this very bold,

deeply insane plan of yours?

STA "Execute" might not have been my
choice of words, but...

that I am, sir.

PKE Black alert.

Let's jump.

TLY  What's happening?

MAY I don't know!

TLY That's probably for me.

MAY More havoc in my home.

The JahSepp have
never encountered

mass like this.

TLY Please assure them,
this isn't an attack.

MAY I won't assure them of anything.

I don't know
the humans on that ship.

TLY But I do. And you know me.
You've been inside my head.

Trust me, we have
a much better chance

of defeating this thing
with what's on board.

MAY You won't abandon us?

What are you doing
with your tiny finger?

TLY It's, um... Just...

Pinky swear.

I told you
I would try to help you.

Where I come from,
we keep our promises.

MAY We have to hurry.

STA Wow.

It worked.

BRN Burnham to Commander Saru,
do you read me?

SAR I'm here, Burnham.

Uh, the sensors show
the mycelium

have already begun
to attack the hull.

Move quickly.

BRN Ready?

PART THREE

TLY Hello?

Computer, report life signs.

Damn it, where is everybody?

MAY Maybe they died
trying to save you.

TLY Hey, thanks for that.

What was that?

MAY The JahSepp have already started
breaking down the hull.

The monster has come here.
TLY Why did it board the ship?

MAY It pursues Discovery every time
you fly through the network.

TLY Whatever it's doing,

I'm not letting it
terrorize my people.

They're my family.

MAY Exactly.

TLY Fall in.

That's soldier for
"Get behind me."

BRN I'm reading a human life sign.

Section 14, weapons storage.

STA Why is Tilly arming herself?

TLY Whatever you are, I'm holding
a type-three phaser rifle.

It is more powerful

and generally larger than
the type-one or type-two.

Uh, which I guess is
why they call it a three.

BRN Tilly?

STA Tilly.

TLY Michael? 
STA Is that May?

BRN Tilly, get down. No, it's not what you think.

TLY She needs our help.

BRN Are you...?

TLY It's me. It's me.

I'm okay. I'm fine.

Thank you for coming to get me.

BRN Always.

STA Restored to one piece,

atom by atom.

BRN We're getting you out of here.

We have less than an
hour before Discovery's

irreparably compromised;
we need to go.

MAY "Compromised"?
We'll be annihilated.

TLY I told her I would stay.

There's-there's some sort
of predator...

MAY A monster! A monster that is,

TLY that is in the network, and
it's killing off her species.

BRN Behind me.

This monster, May...
What can you tell us about it?

MAY It started as a surge
of unknown energy.

We began to reconstitute it,

but it became this creature
out of our control.

Its skin

is indestructible.

We die when we try
to break it down.

STA Wonderful.

Hugh?

BRN But he died.

This isn't real.

STA I thought I imagined seeing him.

HUGH Stay away!

STA Is this some
mycelial manifestation?

Have you, have you created this
from my memories...?

MAY He's real!

BRN What?

MAY Kill it.

Stand down, May. Kill it. Kill it!

Kill it! Kill it!
Kill it! You promised!

STA Wait!

MAY You let it go!

BRN Burnham to the bridge.

We found Tilly.

PKE How soon can you get back?

BRN There's been a complication.

PKE We won't survive complications,
Commander.

BRN I know.

But something resembling
Dr. Culber is here.

PKE Repeat that, Commander. 
BRN Dr. Culber.

Remember? Before you
came aboard, he... 
PKE I know who he was.

I need you to make it
make sense. 
BRN I can't.

Commander Stamets
went running...

PKE Commander Burnham?

Michael?

Mr. Saru? 
SAR I am working on it, Captain.

BRN What if it is the
real Dr. Culber?

Nothing in the known universe
would make that possible.

MAY Your known universe.

BRN Dr. Culber was a healer.

He would never harm
any living being.

MAY You refuse to see
what's right in front of you.

Look.

BRN What is this?

MAY Bark from the yeel tree.

It's deadly to us.

BRN This was all over him.

MAY He uses it to attack us.

BRN He...

He's not using it to attack.

He's using it to defend himself.

Like armor.

TLY Which would give him
motivational

and intentional thought.

BRN Which means... he is alive.

SAR Burnham, can you hear me?
BRN Yes, Commander Saru.

SAR I hate to rush you,

but mycelia have penetrated
78% of the exposed hull,

and that number
is rising quickly.

BRN We're trying to locate Commander
Stamets and Dr. Culber.

What's happening?

SAR Do not worry about us.
Just hurry.

PKE Red alert! Transfer helm control
to Airiam's station.

ARIM The hull of the port nacelle
is too compromised.

PKE I need you to hold her together
under thrust.

ASH This is Agent Tyler

transmitting on
secure emergency channel.

Control, do you read?

PKE What the hell kind of
communicator is that?

LEL Copy, Agent Tyler. Status?

ASH Discoverycould use
an assist, sir.

LEL Say no more.

PKE Explain that to me.

Is that Leland?

LEL Not his call, Chris.
We're standing by to assist.

PKE I don't know what the hell
took you so long,

but we'll talk about that later,
at length.

Can you stabilize us
with your tractor beam?

LEL Firing in three...

two... one.

PKE Five minutes.

LEL If this goes south,
I'm pulling Discovery out.

PKE That's not your call. 
LEL You have one of my agents.

ASH Captain Leland, please don't
risk the Discoverycrew for...

PKE On my bridge, you will speak
only when addressed, Tyler.

And, Leland, my ship, my call.

You will hold
until I give the order.

Are we clear? 
LEL My engines are
about to overload.

We won't be able
to hold for long, Chris.

HUGH You're not real.

STA I am.

W-When I was lost here,
you found me.

Do you remember?

You found me in so many places.

You took me to
the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

when we were on leave.

It was our third date.

And-and you were walking so fast

because you were excited
to show me the de Koonings.

All of them in one room.

I had to run to keep up.

And as you walked, you held out
your hand behind you

because you knew
that I would grab it.

And I did.

And I knew everything
about you in that moment.

And I'm here now.

And here's my hand.

HUGH I thought I was losing my mind.

TLY Dr. Culber?

BRN Oh, no. May, no.
Oh, no.

Don't, please.
Don't do this.

TLY Hey. Hey. May.
May, put it down.

MAY I told you,

he's killing us.

TLY May, look at him.

He's-he's trying
to protect himself.

HUGH It burns.

Everywhere they land on me.

TLY May, you see him?

To him, you're the monster.

This is not who you are.

If you kill him,

it will ruin you.

Can I?

BRN How...

How is he here?

STA When I was trapped
in the network,

I had moments of lucidity.

I saw flashes...

...as if I was moving between
this world and ours.

That's when I found him.

Hugh?

Hugh?

Hugh? No.

No! No!

No.

No.
Please don't go.

Please.

I brought him here.

Thermodynamics.

Energy cannot be
created or destroyed.

BRN It only changes states.

STA Even in death.

His energy passed through me

while I was the link
to the network.

TLY Like a lightning rod.

STA When he took shape,

it-it could only recognize him
as a foreign body,

and it attacked him

the way healthy cells
attack cancer.

BRN We have to go.

Now.Uh-huh.

STA All of us.

I'm taking you home.

LEL The engines are overloading!
We have to disengage!

GRG I'm shutting down
primary regulators

to buy us three minutes
and 30 seconds.

LEL You realize
you're not in charge?

Even Section 31
has court-martials.

GRG Would they court-martial you
if they knew what you did

six years ago on Deneva
to the wrong ambassador?

LEL A minor offense, even
if it were provable.

GRG If someone accessed the data
behind your firewall,

it would be easy to prove.

You may want to consider that.

LEL Three minutes.

Try not to blow us up.

GRG Such a worrier.

LEL We've bought you time.

But not much.

PKE Copy that. Owo,
prepare to disengage

tractor rigs. Mr. Saru,

they need to get a move on.

STA Hugh,

the cube is our airlock between
normal space and the network.

It's safe to cross here.

See?

I'm right here.

HUGH I can't, Paul.

I can't go with you.

STA Why isn't it working?
Why can't he go through?

MAY His energy may have come
from your world,

but everything else,
everything we used

to build his body,
came from ours.

STA So what?
You brought me here.

You can, you can use the cocoon
to transport him there.

MAY I-I moved you.

We did not create you.

Our matter is not your matter.

STA You're saying you can't
rebuild him out there?

MAY I'm saying... I don't know.

I couldn't maintain my own form
without inhabiting you.

HUGH Paul.

The JahSepp can
reclaim my matter.

What are you doing?

You have to let me go.

PKE Burnham, we are out of time!

BRN Understood.

It's now or never.

STA I can't be the cause of this.

I can't leave you twice.

HUGH If you stay,

it'll be twice as deadly
for the network.

STA We'll find another way.

HUGH You're devoted
to creation, to life.

And there are a million reasons
to love you, but that's mine.

Please don't ruin that for me.

TLY Wait a minute.

May, you said
you couldn't rebuild yourself

in our world because you
don't have human DNA.

BRN Right!

Right. That was the
missing ingredient.

The cocoon on our side is made

entirely of atoms
from the human world.

If you take Culber's DNA
and add it to the cocoon,

then maybe he... 
MAY Maybe not.

Either way,
if we use the cocoon,

our door closes.

How many beings have lived
within each other?

I feel I know you
as deeply as I know myself.

TLY I was gonna say that. I was just
worried it would sound weird.

It's not something

I ever thought
that I would have.

We have connected across
evolution and across species.

But when Commander
Stamets lost Hugh,

he lost everything.

And if we have a
chance to fix that,

we have to try.

I really believe
that the universe

will bring us
back together somehow.

MAY You promise?

TLY Promise.

SAR Commander.

BRN On our way.

STA Now, May.

I'll see you on the other side.

BRN Burnham to the bridge.

Black alert.

PART FOUR

PKE Leland, now!

LEL They're activating
the spore drive!

Out of the way!

SAR Commander Burnham?

BRN We made it.

PKE Stand down red alert.

Mr. Saru,

have Dr. Pollard meet
the team in Engineering.

Mr. Tyler.

You'll stay on the bridge.

Liaison protocol.

STA Come on.

Paul?

ADM Old friends
who don't shake hands?

LEL You're a long way
from home, Admiral.

ADM Indeed.

Starfleet has new and
critical information

about the seven signals.

The first one that appeared

led Discovery
to an interstellar asteroid.

But by the time you arrived,
the signal was gone.

We detailed a research vessel
to scan for subspace readings,

and the findings
were unexpected.

For a brief window,

the signal appears
to have left behind

a trail of tachyon radiation.

LEL Tachyons?
Quantum field like that

could imply...
time travel.

PKE Or it could be the by-product
of cloaking devices

or transporters.

ADM You're both right.
Or maybe you're both wrong.

Either way, the only one with

any sort of connection to these
signals is Lieutenant Spock,

who's still a fugitive.

I need both of you to
find him, and I need you

to help each other.

Come on, fellas.

Cut the manlier-than-thou
bullshit.

Leland,

you camouflaged yourself

from a Starfleet
captain, your friend,

in the middle of
a rescue mission.

LEL Admiral, our camouf... 
ADM Save it.

And, Captain Pike,
Section 31 may not be

the shining beacon of righteous
conduct you want it to be,

but they are a critical
intelligence division,

and we have more pressing
priorities than debating

Article 14 of
Starfleet's charter.

Nation building is never pretty.

That is the unappetizing truth,

and you know it.

Now, I don't care

if you feel like
you are on opposite sides.

We are all on the same team.

LEL We go back a long way, Chris.

But my job requires me
to walk a line, and...

I crossed that with you.

I apologize.

PKE It's accepted.

I'll try to remember
that my path is

sometimes clearer than yours.

LEL Well...

that's the understatement
of the millennium.

ADM Now tell me what you know

about the shuttle.

LEL Shuttle was a dead end.

Mr. Spock knows
how to cover his trail.

PKE Burnham might know more about
where he'd be than she realizes.

I'll talk to her.

As we're working together,

I assume my temporary
liaison officer is permanent.

ADM For the time being,

Agent Tyler is yours.

LEL Unless you would prefer
Captain Georgiou.

COMP Incoming message
from Captain Philippa Georgiou.

BRN Put it through
to the science lab.

I heard you bought us
a few minutes.

GRG Is that any way to thank
the savior of the Discovery?

BRN I know you want to be paid back,
in spades.

GRG Maybe I'm an altruist.

BRN Maybe I'm a Terran.

GRG In fact, you were.

Much more fun
than this Vulcan stoicism.

BRN I really need to know
your intentions.

Toward Spock.

GRG I want to find him
before a vigilante mob does,

or a posse of trigger-happy

Starfleet cowboys.

I'm pretty sure
you want the same thing.

BRN There's just no world

where I could give that
serious consideration.

GRG I've had your life
in my hands a dozen times.

You're gonna have to start
trusting me eventually.

BRN Said the scorpion to the frog.

GRG Have a little faith, Michael.

BRN I envy those who can believe

there is a greater hand
writing our story,

who chooses the words
to keep chaos at bay.

Connection.

Joy.

Love.

And resurrection.

With these words, the path
becomes clear for a moment,

and then disappears.

If I have a path...

...I'm still searching for it.

We all are.

That's how we find our way,

by choosing to walk forward,

together.

And if there is a greater hand

leading us
into an uncertain future...

...I can only hope
it guides us well.

THE END
