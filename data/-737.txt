PART ONE 

BRN Personal log,
Commander Michael Burnham.

Any rational explanation
for the seven signals

that have appeared across the
galaxy continues to escape me.

And with it,
perhaps any chance

of a relationship
with my brother Spock.

What did he see in them
that I can't?

My failure to understand feels
like a failure to reach him

at a time
when he might need me most.

COMP Attention: trainee
half-marathon approaching.

TLY On your left!

MAY Hi. Hello.

Hi. It's me! Hello.

It's me.It's me!

Silly Stilly.

TLY You're not really there.
You're not.

You're dead. You're dead.
You're not really here.

MAY Of course I am,
Silly Stilly.

TLY Where did you come from?

And how come
they don't see you?
MAY Only you can.

TLY Why? Why me? 
MAY Don't you remember?

I'm May from junior high.

I'm May... from junior high.
We were friends.

You're the nicest person I've
ever met at this awful school.

TLY I went to that school
for six months.

And then
my mother got another post,

and we moved away, and you and I
have not spoken since then.

And another thing.

You died... years ago.

MAY Is that why you're upset?

TLY I'm upset because you are
a symptom of an unfit mind,

and I can't have that right now.
I just can't.

SAR Oh, my...

The Command Training Program's
half-marathon has a victor.

A lovely show

of endurance and fortitude,
Tilly. All right.

You are dismissed, everyone,
but we will reconvene

later in the day
for Shadow Exercises.

MAY We won!

There is no one else
I would rather cheer on

and support and help.

Causing a nervous breakdown
is not helping me.

BRN Tilly.

...set a new
course record.

She also achieved...

Saru says you not only won,
you beat your personal best.

MAY See? That's how
I'm helping you.

What a team we are!

TLY It's all that training
you put me through.

Thank you, Michael.

BRN I've got to go,
but congratulations.

You're amazing.

BRN Saru, wait up.

COMP Yellow Alert.

RHYS Undeclared craft
on an intercept course.

DET Bearing
three-five-eight mark zero.

OWO Range- 9,000 kilometers
and closing fast.

ARIM No other propulsion
signatures in the sector.

BRY Hailing on all frequencies, sir.
So far they haven't responded.

PKE Tell them if they get any closer
without telling us who they are,

we will activate
tactical systems.

OWO Aye, Captain.
PKE Owo, got anything on scans?

OWO Detecting a small ship.
Two life-forms.

BRY Captain, they've
opened up a channel.

It's a private vessel with
a diplomatic registry number.

They aren't required
to tell us more than that.

The captain's asking me
to beam one aboard.

OWO They're now in range
for a visual, Captain.

PKE On screen.
OWO Aye, Captain.

SAR That ship is Vulcan.

BRN That ship is Sarek's.

I recognize it.

He assembled
a Federation

task force to study
the seven signals.

He might have
some news for us.

PKE He may want to discuss
something else.

I reported Spock's
advance knowledge

of the signals to Command.

The information likely made
its way back to the ambassador,

along with the news that
his son admitted himself

into a psychiatric hospital.

BRN You didn't betray
your friend, Captain.

You followed protocol.

PKE It's easy to say,
harder to believe.

BRN Have you heard from Spock's
doctors on Starbase Five?

PKE No, not yet.

Report to the Transporter Room,
Commander.

Welcome the Vulcan
ambassador aboard.

BRN Yes, sir.

Deck four.

COM  Boarding confirmed.

Transporter lock established.

BRN Energize.
CREWMAN Aye, Commander.

BRN Amanda?

AMD Please don't react.

Spock needs our help.

I could only turn to you.

LRL Out of the fire of war, life begins anew. 
As your chancellor this dynasty springs from me. 
From the twenty-four great houses,
one offspring rises up. 

ASH Beyhold the D7, the future battle cuiser of the Imperial Fleet. 
It bears the banner of no single house, but the insignia of our united empire. 
LRL My torchbearer will oversee production of this ship. 
A ship that shows the galaxy who we are, and what it means to.. remain Klingon. 

KOL Will you make this human our new
fleet captain, too, Chancellor?

Perhaps we should speak in
their standard tongue, too?

LRL Whatever language you prefer,
the truth remains

the same: the Torchbearer was
anointed by T'Kuvma himself.

KOL You mean Voq was.

If you want whatever

this is as your plaything,
he belongs in your bed,

not here.
LRL He belongs

wherever I am.

Just like
the allied Klingon houses,

our union is
what makes us strong.

Your old way of thinking kept us
at each other's throats.

Remove the paint
from your face, Kol-Sha.

We are one culture now.

KOL Your union is an insult
to my son Kol,

and all our sons
who died by human treachery.

This is no
coincidence,

those seven red lights
appeared from the sky

so soon after she took power.

They are an omen!

Seven drops of blood
ready to rain down on us.

ASH Remove the paint.

Your chancellor doesn't
get her hands dirty.

That's the Torchbearer's job,

whether he be human,
Klingon or both.

BRN You know about
the seven signals?

AMD Yes. Sarek informed me.

People are anxious to
know what they are.

MAN Attention all cadets.

BRN Duty log has been updated...

Spock's connected to them.

AMD How?
BRN He left a log claiming

that he saw them long before
they appeared to the Federation.

But until we can speak to
him, we have no answers,

and I don't know
what else to do.

I have no new angles
to investigate.

AMD Except... the one
I'm giving you.

I just came
from Starbase Five.

I went to the psychiatric unit.

They wouldn't tell me
where he was.

They wouldn't let me see him.

They wouldn't say
what was wrong with him.

Thy wouldn't even give me
his personal effects.

BRN You're his next of kin, and
you're a diplomat's wife.

AMD So I did the only
logical thing.

I stole his medical file.

It's encrypted.

Can you please open it?

BRN Mother.

AMD Please.

ASH Ujilli, you are looking well. 
UJILI *Scoffs*
LRL How was your walk?

ASH I have dedicated everything
to your cause.

The least your uncle could do
is acknowledge me.

LRL He and the rest of House Mo'Kai
believe in you.

We have enemies enough.

There is no need
to dream up imaginary ones.

Kol-Sha is telling
council members

that you are advising me

to eliminate the
great houses entirely.

My uncle is disseminating the
truth to counteract his lies.

ASH He looks at me
and sees a human. They all do.

LRL You should not care what anyone
sees when they look at you.

On that subject, only
my opinion matters.

ASH Why do you insist on
speaking English to me?

I'm not a human, L'Rell.

I'm a Klingon whose body was
changed to resemble one.

If we expect others to
acknowledge my Klingon side-

accept me as the Torchbearer-
you must treat me like Voq.

LRL If you are Voq,
then want me back.

Want me.

ASH You touch me...

and that intimacy,

to me, Tyler, feels like...

...violation.

AMD Spock speaks highly
of you, Captain Pike.

Now my daughter does, too,

so I know I've come
to the right people.

PKE Well, ma'am, that makes it all
the harder for me to tell you...

I can't open this file.

If I did, I'd be in violation
of the rules,

and my mother
wouldn't like that.

BRN There is precedent
in Starfleet case law

for a captain to invoke...

PKE Was she this bossy as a kid?

AMD On Vulcan, we call it
"persistent." And yes, she was.

She learned that from me.

PKE Hmm.

Bryce, get me Captain Vela
on Starbase Five.

Tell him it's high priority.

BRY Yes, sir.

VELA Ah.
Chris.

You and my Bisabuela Nena
are the only two people

in this quadrant still
communicating on screens.

PKE Well, your grandma sounds like
a smart lady.

You should introduce us.

VELA Sorry I haven't returned
your call.

PKE "Calls," Diego.

I've been waiting for
an update on my officer, Spock.

VELA I'm sorry,
I can't give you one.

His case is classified.

PKE I'm well within my rights as
his captain to get a prognosis.

Even if that weren't the case,
Spock has information

on the signals I was assigned
to investigate.

Starfleet declared my mission
priority one.

VELA The signals have nothing to do
with it, Chris.

Your guy is wanted for murder.

He killed three of his doctors,
then fled the starbase.

PKE Why isn't word out
about his escape

so that every starship
can be on the hunt?

VELA Elements of the case
just got complicated.

Some of Spock's files
are missing.

We have no idea how.

Rest assured
they've got people on it.

PKE Thanks, Vela.

Pike out.

PART TWO

AMD It's not true.

My son is gentle and kind;

he wouldn't do that.

BRN I agree, Captain.

PKE Well, that makes three of us.

But I don't think the "people"
handling his case would concur.

Our boy's in trouble.

Whatever happened,
he needs a fair shake.

We need to find him
before they do.

Burnham, break into Mr. Spock's
medical file.

That's an order.

STARBASE-FIVE DOCTOR Lieutenant Spock's
intellectual abilities

and capacity for reason
are intact.

Instead, his dissociation
appears acutely emotional.

E.Q. tests and his current
disaffected state

suggest extreme
empathy deficits.

BRN I'll transfer the rest of
the files, and then...

we can decide the
best place to start.

AMD Your wheels are
already turning.

BRN Logic dictates
a few theories:

Spock didn't do it and
he's wrongfully accused;

or he did murder those doctors
in a mentally compromised state,

or in what he thought
was self-defense.

AMD Or...He did it because he's
emotionally compromised.

"Extreme empathy deficit"

is code for psychopathy.

I can't deny
that possibility.

He didn't have
a normal childhood.

Sarek wanted Spock raised
in the Vulcan manner.

And any display of emotion
was strongly discouraged.

And in order not
to confuse my son,

I began to hide my own.

I was not a real mother...

I wasn't what he needed.

BRN You gave us love every second.

AMD It was different
with you, Michael.

I gave you all my joy...

and my affection

that I was not permitted
to give to him.

But Spock is half human.

If he had been permitted
to embrace the feelings

that I know he has
inside of him,

it would've saved him from all
the trouble that he's in now.

Stop.

Those images.

Spock drew them.

I'm sure of it.

BRN He must've...

done them when he was
in treatment.

AMD I thought that he left it
in the past.

But it's back.

BRN What is it?

AMD Your brother called it
the Red Angel.

He started seeing it
when he was a little boy.

It changed him.

BRN I'm sorry.

I have to answer this.

ASH Michael.

Thanks for answering.

BRN Of course.

Are you all right?
Is L'Rell?

ASH For now. She's
still in power

but her opponents continue to
challenge and discredit her.

It's volatile.
BRN How can I help?

ASH The Federation needs to be aware
of the situation.

If L'Rell falls,
peace falls with her.

BRN I'll pass it up the chain
of command immediately.

ASH Thanks.

I should go.
BRN Wait.

ASH What?

BRN I...

I don't know.

I like the beard.

I heard, postwar, the Klingons
are growing their hair again.

ASH The rumors are true.

How are you?

BRN I've been dealing with
some things

regarding my foster brother.

I thought I hit a dead end

but Amanda came and got me
back on track.

ASH Can you ship her over here
when you're done with her?

I'm feeling a little stuck,
myself.

BRN You've got me, right now.

ASH I understood my role here,
to aid L'Rell.

But I'm afraid I'm hurting her.

I'm an easy target
for the old guard.

BRN What does L'Rell think?

ASH That their opposition
is part of the fight,

and their ignorance will be
their downfall.

BRN You admire her.

ASH I do.

BRN It sounds like she feels
the same way about you,

and values having you there.

Try to take her at her word.

ASH It's, uh, it's late here, so...

Take care of yourself, Michael.

BRN You, too, Ash.

ASH Yeah.

SAR Greetings, everyone,

and welcome to Shadow Exercises.

As Starfleet's future chiefs
and captains,

this is your opportunity

to build rapport
with a senior officer,

and see firsthand
what their duties entail.

So let us begin.

Look sharp, people.

This is our future competition.

MAY Is that your captain?

TLY Um, Ensign Sylvia Tilly, sir.

Fully present and
utterly focused

on this very
important exercise

for which I am
all ears, Captain.

PKE  Your dedication
is noted, Ensign.

So, what should we do?

How 'bout we marry some folks,

even if they're not that
into each other, hmm?

TLY Oh, very good, sir.

RHYS Captain. I need your
authorization for this.

MAY I don't understand.
That was funny.

The captain of this ship
isn't funny, he's terrifying.

TLY You may be thinking of an old
captain, Captain Lorca.

MAY Was he shorter?
And blonder?

And much, much whiter? Because
that's who I'm looking for.

'Cause that's who
I'm looking for.
PKE I'm ready if you are.

MAY He's not the man
I need to talk to.

PKE Hop in
the chair, Ensign.
TLY Yes, sir.

PKE Let's run a systems test.

MAY Where is the other captain?

TLY Uh, a systems test.
Uh, where?

PKE Where? In the chair.

TLY Oh. S-Sorry.

PKE Run checklist protocol.

TLY Acknowledged. Uh, step one.

MAY Tilly, this is not right.
My plan is falling apart.

TLY Calm down.

PKE I'm hearing considerably
fewer syllables

out of you than normal.

I-I know the chair
can be intimidating,

but are you okay?

MAY No. We are not okay.
I want the captain.

I want the captain.
TLY This is the captain.

PKE Ensign, what is going on?

SAR Tilly, answer Captain Pike.

MAY Tilly...
TLY No.

I'm not listening to you
anymore.

You tricked me
and you lied to me.

MAY I didn't lie. He's lying.

He's an imposter.

TLY Shut up!

SAR Ensign Sylvia Tilly!

TLY No. I didn't.
I'm sor- I w-

She drove me to it. I...

That doesn't make any sense.
I'm s...

I'm not...

I'm not.

I quit.


ASH You were spying on me.

Your mind plays tricks.

What do you have
against me?

Why do you stop speaking
when I enter a room?

You'll speak now
or I'll slit your throat.

UJI If you feel aggrieved,

take it up with my niece.

It is not House Mo'Kai that
is keeping secrets from you.

ASH What secrets?

UJI L'Rell will be angry

I broke her trust,

but I cannot keep this
from you any longer.

Behold,

the son of L'Rell and Voq.

LRL I learned I was pregnant
right as Voq

was being transformed
into a human.

I could not activate him
on Discovery

while carrying a child.

The gestation
occurred ex-utero.

That is why
it is so small.

ASH "It"?

Does he even have a name?
LRL No.

I have never met
the child.

The baby is a vulnerability.

ASH He's just a vulnerability
to you?

All these secrets and lies

to protect
a failed wartime mission.

What did you gain, L'Rell?

LRL You think your discovery,
made moments ago,

is somehow greater

than the pain I have lived with
all this time?

ASH Would you have
ever told me?

LRL I wanted you
to be able to return

to a human life
without obligation.

You will not be here forever,
Tyler.

ASH Why do say that?
With such certainty,

like you know who I am better
than I do?

I chose to be here.

I'm committed
to that decision.

LRL Why did you call
Michael Burnham?

ASH I trusted her to notify the
Federation that an insurrection

of the High Council
might be brewing.

LRL So she is the only one
you trust.

That is the only reason
it was that

particular human woman?

ASH Yes.

That is the reason.

ASH On my way home, I looked
into one of Voq's memories.

You and he walked across the
ancestral cliffs of the Mo'Kai.

The sun set.

The sky dripped
amethysts.

LRL Our love was greater than that
of Kahless and Lukara's.

ASH Voq thought so, too.

When I stared down
at that baby...

his skin, the same as Voq's,

the distinction that made
him feel like an outsider,

that made his
life so hard,

I felt like I was looking
at myself.

For the first time,
the two sides of me felt whole.

I can't be Voq.

I can't give you back
those memories of long ago.

But I can promise you
a new love story.

I am his father,

and I am
devoted to you.

Let's bring our son home.

The rest will come.

PART THREE 

BRN When did it
first appear to him?

AMD It appeared to Spock

the night you
ran away from home.

The Logic Extremists had
bombed the Learning Center

and almost killed you.
I don't blame you

for wanting to escape
from Vulcan to Earth.

BRN I didn't make it past
the outskirts of ShiKahr.

I still don't know
how Sarek found me.

AMD He didn't.

That was Spock.

We were about to alert
the High Command

to begin a search effort,

and Spock walked
into the room.

He was still
in his pajamas.

His eyes were wide,
and he said

that the Red Angel
had visited him

and told him where you were.

That's where Sarek looked,

and there you were.

Sarek and I
always believed

that Spock used logic

to pinpoint
your direction.

He might have known
what time you left,

how fast you were walking, what
direction you were going in.

And we just wrote the vision off
as a figment of his imagination.

But Spock never wavered.

He said
that the Red Angel was real.

BRN I've seen this angel, too.

It appeared to me on our
mission to the first signal.

AMD Were you the only one?

BRN Yes.

And I wrote it off
as a trick of the mind.

And I didn't get the sense
that it was nefarious.

I cannot believe
I'm talking like this.

I'm not even sure it was real.

AMD It is.

What saved you

hurt your brother.

That vision changed him forever.

I...

I watched him withdraw.

I saw him lose trust
in other people.

I watched
his openness vanish.

BRN It wasn't because of a vision.

It was because of me.

My presence was a
danger to the family.

If the Logic Extremists
couldn't get to me,

they would try to get to him.

And he was my little shadow.

So I had to wound him deep
enough to keep him away from me.

AMD What did you do?

The fact that you're
not saying anything means

that you must have hurt him
irreparably.

Which is why the four of us
can never get together,

which is why you're always
too busy to see each other.

BRN I'm sorry.

I am sorry for what I did.

What I thought I had to do.

I've reached out

so many times

to make amends.

He's not interested.

But I won't give up on him.

I will find him.

AMD No.

I will.

LRL He will not know me.

ASH He didn't know me either.

LRL Uncle.

No, no!

KOL I've been awaiting
your arrival.

Your son is handsome.

But I thought
he could use...

a little color.

LRL I will hunt you down
and rip out your entrails

with my bare hands.
KOL Doubtful.

The paint I begged you
to wipe from my face

was swimming
with sensor implants.

They are a
listening device.

I was only hoping to eavesdrop
on your political strategies.

But I never imagined

I'd learn of this.

LRL The High Council
will not tolerate

this dishonor.
KOL Well, I think

they are more likely
to condone kidnapping

than harboring a spy.

Your pet betrayed the council
to Commander Burnham.

Did he not?

LRL What do you want?

KOL I'm willing to part with him
and let you flee

in exchange for control
of the empire.

You will agree to
my terms and meet me

at your residence.

BRN Saru called down
looking for you.

You all right?

TLY What's wrong?
Have you been crying?

BRN I asked first.

Talk to me.

I need a problem
I can solve.

More than you know.

MAY Talk to me.
Haven't I been punished enough?

What happened up there
was upsetting to me.

I panicked.

BRN Tilly?

MAY Tilly.

Don't ruin what we have.

We're not defeated yet.

TLY After the dark matter hit me,

I s...

I started to see a...

ghost.

She's a girl that I knew
when I was a teenager.

Her name was May.
But she's dead.

And the May that I knew
was really meek and, uh...

kind of goofy when
you got to know her.

But this May
is different.

She's, um... she's insistent.

She's grooming me
for something.

BRN For what?

TLY She hasn't said.

MAY Because you're ignoring me.

And I'm getting scared.

And we need
a new plan.

TLY I am losing it, Michael.

She's wearing me down.

I've been avoiding sickbay.

But, at this point,
I don't know what to do.

I'm desperate.

And after today, I'm
never gonna make captain.

MAY Your eyes are dripping.

'Cause I'm crying.

TLY She doesn't know what crying is.

MAY I've got to think.

I'll be back to talk
some sense into you later.

TLY She left.

BRN How can she not know
what tears are?

That's impossible.

Show me a teenage girl
who's never cried.

You can't.

I know.
I'm a xenoanthropologist.

And if May were a hallucination
pulled from your subconscious,

then she'd know that emotion,
because you know that emotion.

So May is something, Tilly.

But I don't think she's a ghost.

Or a delusion.

You said she appeared to you
after the asteroid shocked you.

But why did it shock you?

I held a piece in my hand,

and I wasn't zapped.

The dark matter component
of the asteroid,

it reacts when it's
in proximity to one thing.

Spores.

You don't need
sickbay.

You need Stamets.

PART FOUR 

UJI Sign.

LRL I am still your chancellor.

UJI You are the
Federation's puppet.

ASH Why is she such
a threat to you, Kol-Sha?

UJI The female?

She's nothing but a...

that lies with a human.

LRL If that is the gravest
insult you can hurl,

you are even less
than I imagined.

I know

I am nothing to you
once I have signed,

so be sure
to kill us both, Kol-Sha.

The one left standing will be
the one who returns for you.

KOL Enough.

Yes. Feel it.

Paralysis...

is spreading to your organs.

But I will not
let you suffocate

until you've signed.

Thank you for my ink.

Now pass me that

pretty little finger.

Now...

for my first act
as chancellor:

an execution.

Now...

you can watch

your Voq die...

for good.

What is that?

ASH Why have you
been spying on me?

GRG Don't be cranky
about it. We have to ensure

that she stays
in the chancellor's seat.

ASH Who's "we"?

Emperor...

GRG You have me confused
with someone else.

I'm Philippa Georgiou,

retired captain
of the U.S.S. Shenzhou,

now Starfleet
security consultant.

Oh, children
are parasites.

Ungrateful.
Inconvenient.

I had to find
someone else

to feed mine, or I would
have gotten nothing done.

LRL I will consider
that advice.

Thank you for your help.

GRG Gratitude is
premature,

as long as the disemboweled
leader of House Kor

is splattered on your floor.

ASH He took our child,
tried to force her to abdicate.

We were defending
ourselves.

Kol-Sha killed your uncle-
it's an eye for an eye.

GRG I need a word
with the chancellor.

Every minute you remain here,
your councilors must reorganize

their tiny male brains

to rationalize why it isn't them
standing on the dais.

They will assume that
all your decisions are Tyler's.

He is a liability.

Can you kill him?

I had to ask.

He is a liability, too.

You can't show weakness

when it comes
to either one of them.

LRL I will not choose
between the chancellorship

and my son and his father.

I told you what
I am here to protect.

GRG I am not giving you a choice.

TLY I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

SAR I am sorry, too.

But thanks
to Burnham's insights,

we are closer
to finding a solution.

And... getting you back into
the Command Training Program.

TLY What about Captain Pike?

SAR I am not familiar enough with the
captain to anticipate his reaction,

but I do know
that he has

a sense of humor...
and that he is fond of you.

STA We should have results

in one second.

MAY I told you

he was shorter, blonder,

whiter...
There he is.
That's the captain. 
TLY No, he's not. 
MAY Yes, he is.
That's where he flies.

STA What's going on?
TLY She's back and
she's pissed.

Maybe at you.

Please hurry.
MAY Stop talking

to him until I tell
you what to say.

STA Just as I suspected.

You are hosting a
eukaryotic organism.

TLY A fungus?

STA Obviously

multicellular,
since it has

opinions.

TLY Fungus.

MAY Don't you dare
diminish...

don't you dare
diminish me.

SAR Anyone who works
around the spore drive

is inoculated-
how did she contract it?

STA It's possible that
a spore evolved

a resistance,
like bacteria.

MAY And don't you
call me bacteria.

TLY Or it's a different spore altogether
than the ones we harvest here.

When Discovery escaped the
Terran universe, their spores

rained down on Engineering.

STA If one attached
itself to you...

Hey, May.

Is that her?

MAY He's the villain. Don't
let him poison you against me.

STA There's our hitchhiker.

A multidimensional,
fungal parasite.

TLY Why does it appear to be someone
I knew when I was a teenager?

Brain manipulation,
perhaps?

MAY These people are lying.

I am not a
manipulator.

You're special, Tilly.
You're my only chance.

I need you.

TLY How do we get rid of it?

STA We use the attraction
between the fungal spores

and the dark matter asteroid
to suck her out of you.

This might hurt a bit.

MAY If you think you
can destroy me, Captain,

you're in for a fight!

SAR Security breach by unknown
alien species in Engineering.

COMP Engage quarantine protocol
Alpha-Omega.

LRL I had a child. Voq was the father. 
I made the human my torchbearer to honor Voq. 
I can no longer say his name. 
Such was the dishonor
he brought.

Secretly, he communicated
with the Federation.

He told them we are disunited
and therefore weak.

He betrayed us.

Lest anyone think
my arrangement with the human

outweighs my loyalty
to the empire,

think again.

The traitor slaughtered
a Klingon infant.

My son.

He would have assassinated
your chancellor

had Kol-Sha not intervened.

The leader of House Kor
gave his life to defend mine.

One house defending another.

His sacrifice is
a lesson to us all.

I, too,
have sacrificed.

I will bear a child but once.

Now...

you are my children,

as I raise this family
to greatness!

Do not refer to me

as Chancellor,

for I deserve a fiercer title.

From this point forth,

you may call me...

Mother.

ASH You synthesized our heads

down to their neural mapping
and genetic codes.

This isn't your everyday
Federation espionage.

What kind of organization
could pull that off?

GRG This kind.

ASH Section 31.

I've heard of black badges;
never seen one.

GRG We've settled into orbit
around Boreth.

Are you sure you want
your boy to become a monk?

ASH It's what L'Rell wants.

GRG And you?

ASH To know where I belong,
and to whom,

and who belongs to me.

My son will be raised

by the most devout
followers of Kahless.

No one leaves the monastery,

and no one who doesn't belong
ever gets in.

GRG Not even his parents?

ASH He'll never know me.

Never know L'Rell, either.

But he'll be safe.

GRG You should consider
staying around.

Our command believes
misfits have merit,

so we keep busy.

ASH I'm surprised you call
yourself a misfit, Emperor.

GRG The freaks are more fun.

LEL Take us to warp.

Control values
his skill set.

We would like you to work
on your recruitment speech.

GRG Don't give me notes.

He's in.
