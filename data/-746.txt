PART ONE 

PKE Commander Airiam reminds us
that resilience

is an unshakable virtue.

She was fiercely loyal...

to her crew...

to Starfleet.

And, in her final moments,

she sacrificed herself
for that loyalty.

That is how she’ll be
remembered.

TLY Some people choose
to live their lives

as if nothing is a miracle,

but Airiam fought for her life,

and so everything was.

Everything that she saw,
everything that she felt,

all of her memories,
they made a kind of...

constellation for her.

I’m... I'm grateful to her
for that lesson.

She was my friend.

STA She said once,

without a hint of self-pity,

that the paths of trillions
of particles

had been forever changed,
simply because

she and her husband smiled
at each other.

She was happy that together

they made the universe
a little less orderly.

DET I just felt the weight

of what I had lost...

but she showed me that
my augmentation didn’t make me

an imitation of myself.

It made both of us new.

And that there could be
a future.

She was right.

BRN There are so many reasons
to join Starfleet.

We get to reach for the stars.

We get to reach
for the best in ourselves.

But, most important,

we get to reach for each other.

We get to do what we love

alongside colleagues
who become friends...

who become family.

And who better to stand with,
shoulder to shoulder,

facing those pivotal moments?

Who more painful to let go?

I am so sorry, Airiam.

SAR On Kaminar,
we sing songs of remembrance

for those who have been taken
from us too soon.

This is a song of remembrance
for Airiam.

ASH You spoke beautifully.

BRN Thank you.

ASH I’m so sorry.

BRN I’m sorry you were confined
to quarters for so long.

I told Captain Pike
you weren’t responsible.

ASH It’s okay.

If I were in his shoes,
I’d have done the same.

I just wish it had
played out differently.

BRN Yeah.

ASH Michael.

BRN I can feel what you’re trying
to do, Ash.

I can.

But Section 31 created Control,

and some future version
of it came here.

And now Airiam is gone.

ASH You don’t think I knew
what was happening, do you?

BRN Of course not.

But your duty is still to them.

So...

PKE Let’s start with
everything we know.

BRN The A.I. is from the future.

It infected Airiam
and forced her

to copy some of the
Sphere data into Control

so Control could evolve.

We stopped her before
that could happen.

ADM How did the Section 31 program

designed to eliminate threats
become the threat?

SPK Time travel.

The one variable we cannot

possibly predict is the future.

And clearly,
that future A.I. is built

on advanced technology of which
we have no understanding.

ADM How do we stop it?
SAR To the best of our knowledge,

the future A.I. only infected
Airiam and Control.

Airiam’s neural system was
erased before her funeral.

As for Control,
it was used only by Section 31.

We destroyed the station
where Control was located,

and, per your
suggestion, Admiral,

we advised all Section 31 ships
to run diagnostic tests.

All came out clean.

PKE Let’s not celebrate just yet.

The A.I. that infected Control

could have sent itself
off-station.

We have to assume that it’s
lying dormant for now,

but it could reemerge
at any time.

ADM And when it does, we have to
be able to destroy it somehow.

TLY Hi. Oh, um... Sorry, uh,
Captain... Admiral. Everyone.

I-I should have knocked.

Although it-it is kind of
pointless, these doors

pretty much open right on
their own most of the time.

SPK Ensign, did you need something?

TLY Uh, uh, well, actually,
I found... I have something.

I mean, I found something.

Um...

So I was, uh...

I was reviewing some scans
of Airiam’s system,

and I-I found this weird
code, and at first,

I figured, uh, it’s just
some junk from an old update,

but then I discovered
it’s actually a file

that was implanted there
by a digital parasite.

The file is called
Project Daedalus.

BRN Those are the last words
Airiam said to me.

TLY The file also contains

a bio-neural signature
of the Red Angel.

Michael, it’s you.

PKE While Dr. Culber hasn’t been
officially reinstated,

I’ve asked him
to oversee analysis

of the data Tilly uncovered.

The results are conclusive?

HUGH Well, every test that I’ve run
on Commander Burnham

is a 100% match
to the bio-neural signature

found in Airiam’s Daedalus file.

ADM We have to consider the source.

Airiam was compromised.

The A.I. could have
had her plant information

to throw us off course.

SPK I see no logical
or strategic reason

for Airiam to have provided
a false positive.

HUGH And even if she had, it would
have read too perfect.

Humans have a few
neural wild cards

that anything artificially
generated couldn’t replicate.

I would have caught it.

PKE We’re saying that Michael,
our-our Michael Burnham,

is going to wake up one day,

access time-travel technology
that doesn’t exist yet,

and take it upon herself
to save the galaxy.

SPK That supposition fits

her emotional profile
rather precisely,

particularly her drive
to take responsibility

for situations
often beyond her control.

BRN Thank you for sharing that
with the group, Spock.

SPK We must also assume
the cataclysmic events I foresaw

when the Angel appeared to me
are a result

of Control evolving,
achieving consciousness.

BRN Let’s assume for a moment
I am the Red Angel.

If I knew about an apocalypse,
why wouldn’t I say so?

SPK Perhaps you simply have
a penchant for the dramatic.

BRN Okay.

SPK The suit was emitting

tetryonic radiation,
which would limit

traditional radio
and sensor communication.

That would explain
my difficulties

in mind-melding with it.

PKE And why it put seven signals
in the sky.

It was trying to get Starfleet’s
attention, maybe to warn us.

BRN But the first three signals

appeared on the asteroid,

Terralysium, and Kaminar,

with four left
to reveal themselves.

If I’m guiding Starfleet

to these specific places

on some sort of path, why?

What do these locations
have in common?

PART TWO

SAR Admiral. Captain.
We’ve just received word

that a Section 31 vessel
is on its way.

ADM The Federation has cleared
Discovery, Lieutenant Spock

and Commander Burnham
of all charges.

If you came all this way
to arrest somebody,

you wasted a trip.

LEL We’re aware, Admiral.

Chris, I’m sorry

for the loss of
your crew member.

We’re here to make sure
nothing else from the future

can attack the Federation.

ADM We’re already working
on a strategy.

GRG In other words,

you’re accumulating input,

which only invites debate.

ADM No debate, no innovation.

GRG I prefer a little
totalitarian efficiency,

but that’s me.

LEL Admiral, we have a solution.

ADM I’m cringing already.

LEL The Angel is the only one
with answers about the future,

the A.I.
and perhaps how to stop it.

PKE And we can’t predict
when or how it will appear.

LEL Correct. So...

we set a trap, we capture it

and make it work for us.

PKE The Red Angel’s
bio-neural signature

was hidden inside Airiam’s data

in a file called
Project Daedalus.

GRG Are you absolutely certain
it was a match to Michael?

BRN It’s me.

SAR As the Angel travels
through time,

she opens a micro-wormhole

along with the possibility that
a future A.I. will follow her.

LEL We can’t let that happen again.

BRN Agreed. Which is why
we have to stop her

from traveling back and forth.

We have to capture her.

Me.

PKE So, how do you propose
we trap her?

LEL 20 years ago,
we discovered the Klingons

were researching time travel.

Obviously a critical
threat... a warrior race

with the ability to rewrite
the past and shape the future?

They’d have wiped us out

before we could even walk
out of the primordial soup.

No offense.

ASH None taken.

They would’ve.

LEL We found ourselves

in a temporal arms race, so
to gain a strategic advantage,

we developed
"The Daedalus Project."

It’s ours.

GRG Section 31’s grand
design for time travel.

BRN You created the Red Angel?

LEL The suit was on the
verge of being tested

when it was destroyed
by Klingon spies.

We thought they had abandoned
the project permanently.

SPK Until the signals began.

LEL Once the suit appeared
alongside the signals,

we started working
on a way to capture it.

A mousetrap, if you will,
to get our technology back.

SAR And the individual
using that technology?

GRG She will not be harmed.

BRN There are gaps in your story
that I find disconcerting.

LEL I’ve told you everything
you need to know.

BRN Not if I’m the mission, sir.
ADM Burnham.

GRG I have the technical
specifications

and a list
of, uh, equipment required.

Provided I may borrow some of
your top minds to build it.

PKE You can work with Commander
Stamets. He’s one of our best.

SPK Even if they succeed,

there is still the matter
of predicting

the Angel’s next appearance.

She has not
consistently accompanied

the arrival of the signals.

BRN Signal or no signal,

there has to be a pattern
to my jumps.

And once we find it,
we’ll find me.

LEL I’ll figure out a way to close
the wormhole once she gets here.

The graviton beams on our ship
should be powerful enough.

SAR I would be happy to assist you

with the calculations,
Captain Leland.

PKE Admiral?

Let’s go build a mousetrap.

BRN Georgiou, wait.

What aren’t you telling me?

GRG How many times
have you asked me that?

Aren’t you getting bored?

BRN I’ll stop asking when it
stops being a question.

I know there’s more to
that Daedalus story.

GRG We shared
what we needed to share.

At least, I have.
BRN Philippa.

I’m putting my life
in your hands.

You asked for my trust.

I’m giving you a way to earn it.

GRG I’m not the one
with the information

you need to hear, Michael.

BRN Leland?

GRG It’s my experience
it’s often our best intentions

that cause us
to do the most harm,

especially to those we care for.

STA This is the Red Angel.

A suit that lets someone travel
through time

via micro-wormholes.

But wormholes
are inherently unstable,

so the Angel
needs to hold them open

or she won’t be able
to get home again.

And as I understand it,

to keep the wormhole open,
the suit generates

a membrane, a protective
layer that travels with her,

and one end stays attached

to her starting
point in the future.

An anchor.

When she wants to go home,
it snaps her back

like a rubber band.

TLY Our phase discriminators

will hold the Angel
in stasis beams

so the membrane
can’t snap her back.

And then we’ll lower
her to a platform,

where an electromagnetic pulse

will shut down the time crystal
that powers her suit.

STA And, uh, then we

raise the containment field,

and that will hold her here
for as long as we want.

And then, uh,
we can question her,

and nothing from the future
will be able to reach us. Right?

What’s that look on your face?

GRG I was thinking you may be

smarter than the Stamets I knew.

You’re also much more neurotic.

Have you considered medication?

STA Um, based on my calculations,

the phase discriminators
should function properly.

The problem is...

HUGH Uh, hey, Tilly.

Is, um, Admiral Cornwell here?

I thought she might be...

TLY Yeah. What? No, she’s not.

No, but it is... it’s great...

uh, so great that you’re here.

GRG Please, your wide-eyed attempt

to release
this fabulous male tension

is a buzzkill.

You never learned to relish

a little discomfort, Red?

Who raised you?

TLY My-my mom. My mom.

But she wasn’t around a lot.
Stop talking.

GRG You said
there was a problem, Paul?

STA Uh, yes, with the...
the phase discriminators.

Uh, we’d need the equivalent
of 12 warp cores

to generate enough energy
to-to run them,

and if we can even locate

that much power, it will be
almost impossible to control.

GRG Not for you.

In fact,
we don’t need warp cores.

One of the Project
Daedalus testing sites

was on Essof Four.

STA Y-Yes, I’ve read
about that place.

So much deuterium.

We can use it to create
a plasma reactor

to power up
our phase discriminators.

And then, snap,
we have our mouse.

GRG You are savvier than he was.
Um...

HUGH you-you do know that
he’s gay, right?

GRG Don’t be so binary.

In my universe,
he was pansexual,

and we had DEFCON-level
fun together.

And you, too, Papi.

HUGH Did you just call me Papi?

STA Uh, well, in my universe

and pretty much any universe
I can possibly imagine,

I’m gay.

And so is he. 
GRG Of course you are.

I’m glad we all see

what’s right in front of us.

And now, if you’ll excuse me,

I need to talk to Captain Pike
about setting a course

for Essof Four.

TLY What just happened?

PART THREE

NAHN Commander.

BRN Hey.
NAHN I just...

Look, my job is to preserve as
many lives as possible at any cost.

But what you said
at the service...

It is hard to let go.

BRN You did the right thing.

I’m grateful you were there.

NAHN Strange way to get
to know someone, but...

after seeing how hard
you fought for her,

the real her...

Let’s just say I'm grateful
you were there, too.

SAR The wormhole used

by the Red Angel would close
on its own eventually,

but we must find a way
to force it closed immediately

or risk
another A.I. infiltration.

Unfortunately,
Discovery’s graviton beam

is not powerful enough to...

LEL Which is why I said
I’d do it from my ship.

I’ll have Specialist Tyler help.

We’ll close it fast.

Did Captain Pike decide

that I needed a monitor?

Is that why you’re here?

SAR I chose to work with you

because I wanted
to assess you myself.

Section 31 has engaged

in questionable practices
of late.

Given that we will be
working together

and the lives of those
I care for may be in your hands,

I need to know
that you can be trusted.

LEL If you can tell the answer,
I’m not doing my job very well.

SAR Even without my ganglia,

I still have
strong instinctive reactions

to dangerous situations
and individuals.

LEL And?

SAR I believe you will work

to protect your crew and ours

to the very best
of your ability.

I also believe

there are many things
you are not saying.

BRN Excuse me.

Mr. Saru.

May I have a moment
with Captain Leland, please?

SAR Certainly, Commander.

BRN Captain, we’re preparing
a strategy to capture me.

I have a right
to know everything you do.

As in everything you know.

You are capable of some
intricate moral gymnastics.

And that’s your job, right?

But I am giving you one chance

to explain everything
as you need to explain it.

LEL I knew your parents.

They worked on Project
Daedalus for Section 31.

I had them stationed
on Doctari Alpha.

BRN No.

We were stationed there

because my parents wanted
a change of scenery.

And we only stayed
as long as we did

because I wanted to see
a star go supernova.

LEL You were there... because of me.

Your parents...

Your parents
were killed there...

because of me.

BRN My parents... were scientists.

My father was
a xenoanthropologist.

My mother was an astrophysicist.

They wouldn’t have been involved
in Section 31.

LEL She was also an engineer.

A brilliant one.

They were working on a theory
that sudden technological leaps

across certain cultures,
including those on Earth,

weren’t happenstance

but the result of time travel.

BRN No. They would have known
that certain leaps,

including
technological advancements,

can be explained.

LEL I wasn’t convinced, either.

Until they built the suit.

BRN No.

No, they didn’t mention
anything like this to me.

LEL Because it was classified.

And very dangerous.

BRN What did you have to do
with this?

LEL The suit was missing a key
component: a time crystal,

the element that would enable
it to jump through time.

We got Intel from an
operative on Qo’noS

that a time crystal had
hit the black market

near the Orion Outpost.

I used my assets in
the sector to steal it.

See, I thought
that we had made it untraceable.

But the Klingons tracked it
to Doctari Alpha.

Where a star
was about to go supernova,

releasing a massive amount
of energy.

BRN (CRYING) This whole time...

I thought...

We were there because of you?

For a time crystal?

And you let
the Klingons track it?

LEL I was young,
I was ambitious, I...

I was careless.

I should have done more
to protect your parents.

I know how much this has
cost you, and I’m so sorry.

I hope...

BRN That’s for my mom.

That’s for my dad.

This isn’t over.

ASH I just uploaded all
the Section 31 signal data. 
BRN Did you know?

ASH Know what? 
BRN That Leland was responsible
for the death of my parents.

You knew, didn’t you?

ASH No.
BRN Don’t lie to me, Ash.

ASH Michael, I don’t know
what you’re talking about.

BRN Every moment
you work for Section 31,

you’re announcing who you are.

You’re saying this is your
compass, this is your course.

You can live with that?

ASH Section 31 has
a specific mission.

I don’t always agree
with their tactics,

but I do believe
in their mission.

BRN No matter who pays the price?
ASH It’s not black and white.

They-they also do a lot of good.

BRN I’ll take that as a "yes."

ADM Come.

HUGH Admiral, uh,
they said you were here.

Do you have a moment?

ADM I do.

HUGH You, uh, used to be a therapist.

ADM Yes, I’m aware.

What’s on your mind, Doctor?

HUGH Doctor.

ADM I can understand how that
might sound strange to you.

I would assume

everything
is strange to you now.

Your experience transcends

everything we know
about identity.

HUGH I’ve never felt more alone
in my life.

Even sitting here.

ADM Commander Stamets is the person
who knew you most profoundly.

HUGH You used the past tense.

ADM Well, you are... new.

HUGH I remember Paul.

I remember loving him,

but if feels like a dream.

It’s someone else's life.

And I don’t know
what I feel about him now.

ADM Do you feel pressure
to feel something?

HUGH I can’t give him what he needs.

And I don’t want to hurt him.

ADM All right. You know that.

You know you don’t want
to hurt him. 
HUGH That’s not enough.

ADM Enough for what?

HUGH Enough for the man
I know loves me.

And who I once loved.

ADM Love is a choice...

Hugh, and one doesn’t just
make that choice once.

One makes it again and again.

HUGH I’ll let you get back to it.

ADM Doctor.

The only way to make a new road

is to walk it.

HUGH Thank you, Admiral.

SPK I’m sure Captain Leland
appreciates your choice

of high-density urethane foam
in lieu of his nasal cartilage.

BRN Spock, no offense,
but you’re the last person

I want to talk to right now.

SPK You are angry.

An understandable reaction.

You lost your friend.

Knowing her death
was unavoidable

would not provide solace.

You also learned
that you are the Red Angel,

which does not make
logical sense despite

its correlation
to your emotional profile.

BRN Spock...

SPK Finally,

you discovered
your parents were killed

because of Captain Leland’s
negligence,

which does not make their loss

any more acceptable.

I do wish I’d been there
when you struck him.

I believe I would have
found the moment...

satisfying.

You have experienced
a series of events

in which both emotion
and logic have failed you.

In my experience of this,
it is...

uncomfortable.

BRN Very.

What you said about...

me always finding a
way to blame myself...

You are right.

I brought my guilt
into your home.

I’m sorry.

SPK You were a child...

with a child’s understanding
of an event

that even adults
would struggle to comprehend.

However, if it will

ease your suffering,

I accept your apology.

BRN Thank you for coming
to talk to me.

It was unexpected.

And helpful.

SPK I had not anticipated
this conversation, either,

but I appreciate it, as well.

BRN So, why did you come
to see me, then?

SPK In your absence,
I made a discovery.

I now understand the variance
in the signal patterns...

What causes the Angel to appear
at certain times and not others.

BRN And?

SPK The variance is you, Michael.

PART FOUR

BRN We don’t have to wait.

We can set the trap directly
on Essof Four.

PKE The plan was to power the
trap there and take it

wherever we find the Angel.
What’s changed?

BRN We’ve been trying to track her
by the signals,

asking when
she might appear somewhere.

But what we should have been
asking is why.

Why does she appear
where she does?

SPK Each signal brought Discovery to

a location where
lives were saved.

The Angel appeared at some of
those locations, but not all.

Leaving no clear pattern
to suggest intent.

However, there is a pattern
to her appearances

without any signal.

BRN As when Spock was a boy and it
warned him that I was in danger,

when it appeared to me on the
asteroid when I was injured,

seeing it gave me strength,

knowing that help was
on the way.

PKE You were saving your own life.

SPK The Grandfather Paradox.

Future Burnham would not exist

if Present Burnham were
to perish.

GRG When Michael’s life
was in danger,

her guardian Red Angel
intervenes.

BRN Which means
I have to be the bait.

PKE What does that mean exactly?

BRN The place doesn’t have
a breathable atmosphere.

We set a trap, I go down.

You let me start to suffocate.

GRG Are you insane?
PKE Absolutely not.

SPK The Angel will protect her,
Captain,

or her efforts to
communicate with us,

to save the galaxy,
would be for naught.

BRN And if anything were
to not go as planned,

Dr. Culber will be right there
to resuscitate me.

SPK But we do not believe he will
ultimately be necessary.

BRN I’m not looking forward to it,
Captain... far from it...

But we do not see any other way.

PKE What you are asking me to allow

is in direct opposition

to the oath I took
as a Starfleet captain.

BRN I understand,
but with all due respect,

between risking myself
and risking all sentient life,

there is no choice.

Captain, if we’re going to capture
the Red Angel, you have to let me die.

SPK To call Essof Four inhospitable

would be a gross understatement.

Temperatures fluctuate wildly.

And its carbon monoxide
atmosphere

is laced with perchlorate dust

which will quickly prove lethal

to any oxygen-breathing
life-form.

STA But the facility itself
has oxygen, doesn’t it?

SPK That is correct.

GRG So we’re going to the
Ninth Circle of Hell to capture

a Red Angel.

I’d enjoy the irony of that
if this weren’t so dangerous.

PKE Commander Stamets,

your work must be precise.

We have to succeed
on the first attempt.

We won’t have
another opportunity.

Once Commander Burnham is
strapped into that chair,

the roof will recede,

she’ll be exposed
to the toxic atmosphere,

and she will have exactly
two minutes to live.

GRG And she’ll suffocate...
painfully.

PKE Dr. Culber, be prepared

to breach the target
area and resuscitate.

HUGH I will. Don’t worry, sir.

SPK But you cannot
revive her too early,

or the Angel will not appear.

And if she does not,

we will lose much more than
the life of Michael Burnham.

All sentient life will be lost.

ASH Hey.

BRN May I come in?

ASH Yeah.

I’m glad you're here.

You have to know,
what happened to your parents...

BRN Please don’t apologize.

What I said to you was not fair.

I was angry,

and I didn’t know
where to put it.

ASH I think you put it where
you knew it would be okay.

BRN I don’t... I don't want that
to be our last conversation

if, um...

ASH No, don’t even think that way.

This will work.

You have an entire crew
dedicated to saving your life.

You have me.

(BURNHAM CRIES)

BRN I’m scared.

ASH Me, too.

SAR Captain, the facility
is prepped and ready.

The away team is on site.

PKE Welcome to the bridge,
Lieutenant Nilsson.

NIL Standing by, Captain.

STA Bringing phase discriminators
online.

HUGH We didn’t get a chance to
talk at Airiam’s funeral.

I just...
wanted to say I’m sorry.

STA Thank you.

HUGH Paul...

STA This isn’t the time.

Might not ever be the time.

GRG Are you ready?

BRN As I’ll ever be.

GRG Michael Burnham,

always willing
to sacrifice everything

for the good of others.

We’ll monitor exposure time

from the moment
the roof retracts.

BRN Why didn’t you just tell me
about my parents?

GRG It wasn’t my story to tell.

But I could make certain
it was told.

BRN I got to go.

GRG Let us hope the Angel
lives up to her name.

PKE Captain Leland,

are you and Mr. Tyler ready
to go?

LEL Standing by to close the
wormhole in the Angel’s wake.

PKE Make it fast.

LEL Trust me, the last thing I want

is another A.I.
infecting our systems.

ASH Michael...

BRN I know, Ash.

What if it doesn’t work?

SPK Were you to perish,

I would be charged with killing
a Starfleet officer.

Again.

It would therefore be ideal

if you survived.

BRN Such a way with words, Spock.

PKE On your mark, Commander.

BRN Ready.

STA Shutting down life support.

GRG Starting timer now.

PKE Two minutes and counting.

HUGH Oxygen saturation
level’s at 85%,

and falling fast.

If it drops below 40,
she won’t make it.

ADM Ensign Tilly, tachyon update.

PKE Ensign, are you picking up any
spikes in the tachyon radiation?

TLY Sorry, sir.
Um, no change.

What if she isn’t coming?

HUGH Oxygen saturation
is down to 62%.

Heart rate spiking.

GRG She wants out.

It’s over.

We’re coming to get you,
Michael.

SPK Wait. She’s saying something.

BRN Var-Var...

SPK Variance.

She said "variance."

GRG I don’t give a damn
what she said.

Get the oxygen.
Follow me.

SPK Michael means that
she is the variance.

She is creating a
situation where

the Red Angel will have
no choice but to save her.

GRG That thing is not coming,

and Michael
is shaking her head no!

SPK Because she does not
want interference.

We must let it proceed.

HUGH Oxygen is down to 42%.

If I don’t get to her,
she’ll die.

SPK Yes, Doctor.

That is the idea.

ADM Status reports.

TLY No change in tachyon levels.

BRY Sensors stable on my end, too.

No sign of the Red Angel.

ADM Your call.

PKE This operation is over.
Away team, get her out of there.

HUGH We can’t, sir.

Lieutenant Spock is

holding us hostage.
Says we have to let her die.

PKE Damn it, Spock, stand down!

SPK I’m sorry, Captain.
I cannot.

PKE - Spock, stand down!
 That’s an order!

SPK I am sorry, Captain. I cannot.

PKE Ops, beam Commander Burnham
directly to sickbay now.

OWO I can’t, Captain.
There’s too much interference

to get a lock on her.

ADM Interference from what?

TLY I’m detecting a massive surge

in tachyon radiation.

ASH Captain!

LEL Get us over there! Now!

PKE Shields up. Red alert.

Get ready, Spock.

It’s coming.

PKE I need eyes. 
SAR Working on it.

ASH I’m having trouble stabilizing
the beam. I need more power!

LEL Keep firing. I’ll override
the security buffers.

Get that damn thing closed
as soon as you can!

GRG Now!

LEL Authorizing
security buffer override.

COMP System offline.

LEL Tyler, I need...

COMP System online. Never mind.

LEL Authorizing
security buffer override.

COMP Working.

Let’s go. It is not that hard.

Let’s go. Let's go.

It is not that hard.

LEL Tyler, you should have
the power you need now.

ASH Wormhole’s closed!

STA Reengaging atmosphere.

DET Systems back up.

PKE Can you get out there
to Burnham?

STA Not yet. It’s not safe.

Firing EMP.

We have the Red Angel.

Raising containment field now.

BRN Mom?
