PART ONE 

CREWMAN ONE All right, Detmer!

CREWMAN TWO Detmer!

CREWMAN THREE Way to go, Detmer!

OWO All right, Detmer!

SAR Well done, Lieutenant Detmer.

CREWMAN ONE Someone buy that woman a drink.

And a neuroblocker for me.

OWO Keyla?

DET Yeah.

OWO We made it.

We're good.

You need to go to sickbay.

DET Uh, no, it's nothing.

SAR Your comrade is correct,
Lieutenant.

Get to sickbay.

DET Yes, sir.

SAR Status reports?

RHYS Tactical systems are down.

BRY As are long-range comms

and all inship communications,
Commander.

TLY Sensors are not responding.

We don't know where we are,

and we don't know when we are,
sir.

JET My back might be
short-circuiting

my brain right now,

but I don't recall Terralysium
being particularly icy.

SAR Can you speculate on the cause
of the systems outage?

JET Based on how hard we hit,

probably
a plasma manifold rupture.

We'll have to find and fix
all the blown

EPS relays and conduits
on the ship

before we can go anywhere.

BRY We can't fly.

We can't call for help.

We can't call Michael.

JET She's alone.

SAR We are completely disconnected

at present, yes.

But...

we are also together.

And alive.

If Commander Burnham
landed elsewhere,

I trust she is aware
that we will find her

as soon as we are able.

Begin a search for the affected
relays and conduits.

Inform all you come
in contact with to do the same.

Crew members are to work
in pairs until

internal communications
are reestablished.

OWO Commander, we can't locate

the problems
without internal sensors.

JET I can modify the tricorders,

like I did on the Hiawatha.

SAR I will survey the damage
in person.

And...

I am aware

that you all may feel

an expedited need
to see and understand

what is out there.

But our first priority
is in here.

The integrity of this ship
and this crew.

Am I clear?

CREW Aye, sir.

SAR Lieutenant Rhys,
you have the conn.

Ensign, with me.

MAN Coming through on your right.
TLY 
It's, uh...

It's odd.

Uh, there are, um...
Excuse me... large pockets,

uh, on the surface where
the atmosphere has higher levels

of oxygen
than the rest of the planet.

SAR Is there any discernible
pattern? A design?

TLY Yes, sir.

Ea-Each pocket
is essentially a-a decagon,

which would in-indicate to me
that someone made them.

SAR I don't know, but it's
the only explanation.

Then we are not on Terralysium.

TLY No, sir.

Um, but there is evidence
of an active settlement

within one of these pockets,
so there...

...there's life.

SAR There is... life.

How long for repairs,
BRY Mr. Bryce?

Well, it's not a repair, sir.

For this particular transtator,
it's...

a complete rebuild.

Six hours, minimum,

assuming we have
enough rubindium.

So, no communications
until then.

TLY Um, you have some, uh,

Leland on your shoes.

GRG Somebody had to make sure
he was dead.

Someone else needs
to clean the spore cube.

There's gooey bits of him
everywhere. You.

Did I hear you say we still have
no communications?

BRY Uh...

SAR He will complete repairs as soon
as he is able, Commander.

All available hands are busy
repairing the EPS grid.

Do you require
medical attention?

GRG Of course not.
We can spare one engineer.

SAR Uh... I have no desire to leave
Commander Burnham on her own,

but we must get all systems
up and running

as quickly as possible.

Wherever we have arrived,

we are strangers.

We cannot assume
that we are welcome.

Carry on, Mr. Bryce.
BRY Yes, sir.

TLY Oh.

Commander, uh, sorry, excuse me.

HUGH Paul? Paul?

STA I know. I know.

TLY Dr. Pollard!

MAN Biobed.

HUGH I'm going to induce coma.

You'll be fine.

STA Where...

HUGH Can you hear me?

STA Hmm?

HUGH Follow my fingers.

Good. Good.

We made it through.
STA Mm.

HUGH But it was
a pretty rough landing.

And I wouldn't have brought you
out so soon,

but there are some people
in really bad shape.

We need your biobed.

STA Worse than me?

HUGH Yeah.

STA Wh...
When are we?

HUGH We don't know when we are.

Sensors are down.

Comms are down.
STA What?

HUGH Soon as I have an answer,
I'll let you know, okay?

I'm gonna take you to the
cellular regeneration chamber,

and you should be good
in a few days.

STA I'm good now.
HUGH No.

No, you're not.

Take it slow.
STA Mm.

The-the... the plasma manifold.

The EPS grid is...?
HUGH It's being handled.

STA They'll need
all the help they can get.

HUGH I'll tell you what.
I'll let you go to work

if you can spell
"My Partner Brought Me Out

of a Coma and All I Got
Was This Lousy T-Shirt."

Spell it.

STA My brain...

HUGH Yes, it's scrambled like an egg.

Come on. Slow.

STA Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

STA L-O-U-S-Y

T-S-H-I-R-T.

HUGH "T-shirt" has a hyphen.

Cellular regeneration
is the only way

we're gonna get you even
moderately functional today.

One full cycle, minimum.

Five cycles if you want
to finish healing that scar.

STA Ow! Are you punishing me?

HUGH Yes. And I love you.

And that was a neuroblocker
to help

with the pain,
so you're welcome.

And if you don't stay in
for a full cycle

before doing anything else,
I'll have Saru ground you.

Understood?
STA Understood.

It's good to have you back.

HUGH It's good to have you alive.

Mm-hmm. All right.

DET He didn't make it?

POL No.

Your neurological tests
are clear, no concussion.

You're good to go.

DET What?

POL I said you're good to go.

Is there something else?

DET No.

Thanks.

GRG Why is this here? Shouldn't

what's-his-name
be building the new assembly?

TLY We don't have enough rubindium
on board.

GRG No transtator means
no communication.

Not within this ship,
not outside of this ship,

and not to Michael,
wherever she is.

TLY Scans show that the settlement

has a natural supply
of rubindium,

as well
as several other minerals,

most of which
I can't even begin to identify.

GRG Looks like
the future has brought us

an entirely new elemental table.

NAHN I think
there's enough able-bodied

to pull together a recon team.

SAR Are there other relevant details
you've gathered thus far?

TLY Not much.

Um, I have a lot of information
about this planet,

but I don't know
which planet we're on.

GRG This is like reading an obituary
backwards.

TLY The settlement only has 50
life signs, but they have ships

whose design would presume
warp capability, but...

I haven't gotten
any dilithium readings.

So they couldn't
possibly fly them.

I don't understand, but, um,

they have warp, and they have
ships, so that's, uh...

that's one... c-common, um...

mutual, uh...

GRG Should we get
the Command Training Manual,

or can you find your own way
to making a point?

SAR Commander.
GRG We need to fix communications,

and time is of the essence.

SAR We are all
acutely aware of that.

We will acquire what we need
to repair our transtator

as quickly as possible,
and we will reveal as little

of ourselves as possible

in the process.
GRG They have

an artificial atmosphere, Saru.

These are not Kelpiens
who have never seen a starship.

NAHN They have 930 years

on us. Why hide from them?

SAR Assuming we arrived
in the correct time,

we carry with us a knowledge

of certain past events
that we cannot share,

lest we impact the present

or future of any society
with which we interact.

Whether or not
the local population

is more or less advanced

is immaterial.

We will adhere
to their cultural standards.

We will barter peacefully.

GRG We crash-landed,
and we're going in blind.

The chances
that they greet us peacefully

are preposterously low.

SAR We will not abandon
what we believe.

GRG If this were my planet,

I'd already have us surrounded,
weapons drawn.

SAR I am not asking you
to participate, Commander.

I am telling you
what we will do in your absence.

Ensign Tilly, you will join me.

TLY Me?
NAHN Her?

GRG I'm sorry.
Are you trying

to get us all slaughtered?

She has as much
psychic dominance as a kitten.

TLY Okay, what the fuck!
Uh.

Uh...
SAR Report to sickbay.

We will have Dr. Pollard
administer appropriate treatment

so that we may breathe naturally
in this atmosphere.

Commander Nhan, I am placing you
in charge of the ship's repairs.

And I need you to assist
in the repair of the EPS grid.

If we cannot fly
to Commander Burnham's location,

we are of no use to her.

You are dismissed!

PART TWO

JET How many drugs
are you on right now?

STA I'm just...
moving a little slowly.
JET As a person
in great pain would move.

Uh, as I know all too well.

Let me take a wild guess.
You didn't find what

you were looking for,
and are now wondering

if maybe the problem's
in the Jefferies tubes?

STA Why are you talking to me as if
we're working on this together?

JET Because that's exactly
what's happening.

STA Absolutely not.

JET Saru wants us working on teams.

And apparently, if you can
breathe, you can work.

So, unless Hazmat over here
is gonna be helping

after he cleans up aisle five...

GENE My-my name's Gene, actually.

JET I've already forgotten that.
STA I don't need...

I've already determined the
location of the ruptured relay.

JET Great. Let's go.

STA That wasn't an invitation.

I can do this on my own.
JET Fine. Then I'll just

follow you
for the witty repartee.

TLY Nobody's ever been here before.

No one's ever... had to say
what this is like or, uh,

what this feels like.

It's just...
It's so weird. Just...

I mean,
there's a giant hunk of planet

hanging there in the sky.

I wish we had the time to figure
out how all this works.

Sorry, sir. I'm-I'm talking
because I'm scared.

SAR I know.

Keep talking, Ensign.

TLY You know, on the ship, I said

the scans were, uh, odd
or, uh, strange?

But it's not true.
It's that...

we're odd and strange.

SAR Well, not to each other.

TLY Thank you for asking me
to accompany you, sir.

Why did you ask me
to accompany you, sir?

SAR I needed an engineer.

TLY The ship's full of engineers.

Georgiou's an engineer.

SAR An engineer I can trust.

TLY She thinks I'm useless.

SAR She's concerned for Michael

and lacks the self-awareness

to control her behavior
in such an unsettled state.

We are introducing ourselves
to the future.

You, Ensign Tilly,

are a wonderful
first impression.

SAR First contact.

NAHN It's parasitic ice of some kind.

Nilsson and her team are trying
to figure it out.

So far, we know
it accelerates in the shade,

so when the sun goes down,
we're screwed.

GRG All the more reason
to get off this piece of rock

before we're entombed
like woolly mammoths.

NAHN Oh, that's a fun new sound.

All relays and conduits
are clear on Deck Four.

We could use some help
on Deck Eight.

GRG What the hell
are you doing here,

besides saving their asses?

NAHN Saving your ass.
You're welcome.

GRG I don't do gratitude.

You could have stayed
on the Enterprise

and remained in the time
you were meant to be in,

if you believe in that kind
of thing, which I don't.

NAHN I stayed for Airiam.

She was a science officer, but
she paid the price of a soldier.

I felt like
somebody should honor that.

A life for a life, you know?
GRG I do.

What an unbelievably
shitty decision.

NAHN Says the woman who's still here.

GRG Section 31 would have begged me
to take over sooner or later,

and bureaucracy is
where fun goes to die.

I like jumping
from universe to universe.

LINUS Commander?

The EPS grid is functional
on Deck Six.

Hello, Georgiou.

GRG You must have
an enormous visible spectrum.

LINUS Hmm. 74,000 nanometers.

GRG We should talk.

NAHN Report to Deck Eight, Linus.
They could use help.

GRG I'll join him.

See you later.

TLY Those are blast marks
on those rigs.

Somebody wanted
to shut this place down.

SAR So it would appear.
TLY Not to state the obvious, sir,

but it occurs to me that
the somebody we're following

could be the same somebody
who wanted

to shut this place down.

It could be
a different somebody,

but if it's not,
then we would be walking into,

um, a, a trap... maybe?

SAR I would never expect any
of my crew to not have fear.

But I will ask you
to contain it now.

Are you with me, Ensign?

TLY Hundred percent, sir.

Shit.

SAR Greetings.

We mean no harm.
Our ship crashed.

OS A Starfleet ship. We know.

TLY So much
for not giving ourselves away.

KAL Who are you?
What do you want?

SAR I am Saru.

This is Tilly.

TLY My name lacks authority.

KAL What?
SARWe are officers of Starfleet.

KAL Prove it.
SAR You...

have already identified
our ship.

OS Anyone could be flying
that ship.

TLY Starfleet Regulation 256.15:

"Officers shall display

behavior befitting
an officer at all times."

Which is why we're not

freaking out right not
about being held at phaser point

by a bunch of strangers.

It's actually really scary, so

could you please
lower your weapons or...

I don't know, tell us your name,

so one of those things
isn't true.

KAL My name is Kal.

I told you.

OS They can't help us, Kal.

KAL Yes, they can.

And they will.

It's a-a part of them.

How they are.

SAR Uh, friends,

our navigation system
is damaged.

What planet are we on?

KAL It's never had a proper name.

We call our home The Colony.

We're miners,
many of us Coridan.

OS Please, Kal...

Zareh will have
tracked them here.

KAL I know.
TLY Who is Zareh?

OS Can your ship fly?

KAL Do you have a weapons system?

SAR We are a science vessel.

A piece of our communications

equipment is damaged.
OS Kal...

they have to go.

TLY Who is Zareh?

We have dilithium.

We do, we can, we can help you.

We can help each other.

KAL I told you.

How much dilithium?

TLY Sufficient to power
your vessels.

KAL We need more... and extra
to sell at the Exchange.

And we have to fix
our equipment as well.

SAR I am confident that we can
come to an agreement.

KAL Give it to me.

We have to hurry.

STA The blown relay can be accessed
via the junction point

five meters up.

And then it's located
11 meters in.

Should be an easy fix.
JET Great.

Let me know if you need
any help.

STA I need you

to access the blown relay.

JET Sorry, sunshine,
the spine says no.

STA So, what, you're just
gonna sit there?

JET I'm offering moral support.

And you're in great shape,
right?

I mean, for two hours
I've just heard about

how pain is not
in your vocabulary.

STA Uh, fine.

I'm...

experiencing some discomfort.
JET Yeah.

You were impaled
by a seven-inch shard

of duranium alloy

and put in a coma.

Helpless is a shitty feeling.

But it is not forever,

and it doesn't make you
any less capable.

Do us both a favor,

and just admit that you're
not bringing your A game.

Let's get Nilsson up there.

I'm sure she could do it.

STA No.

I'm good.

I've got this.

I have never seen
anything like this.

KAL How old is your starship?

TLY Oh, we like to think of her
as a classic, so...

This is your repair kit?

KAL Uh...

TLY Whoa.

I've never seen
rubindium do that.

KAL This is programmable matter.

TLY Yeah, no, no, I know.

That was a quiz.

You passed.

Luckily, my repair database

has equipment
with similar functionality

to your transtator.

Otherwise,
I couldn't have helped.

TLY Can't bake a peach pie
with a gazpacho recipe, right?

Oh, that's something
my grandma used to say.

You're really adept at that.

Wow.

KAL Maybe I'm Starfleet material.

I just always believed
you would come.

And you did.

So...

TLY Been a long time, huh?
KAL Yeah.

But once we're
self-sufficient again,

we can defend ourselves.

TLY Why did nobody try until now?

KAL My brothers tried.

SAR Might I inquire as to why

this Zareh inspires such fear?
OS Might I inquire

how you managed to avoid finding
that out for yourself?

SAR As I said, we have been
adrift for quite some time.

OS Yeah, well, you should
have stayed adrift.

You're just gonna
make things worse.

Zareh's our courier.

He delivers what
we can't make or grow.

Which is pretty much everything.

SAR And you have no dilithium

to gather what you need
for yourselves.

How long has he exploited
your community?

OS Since he blasted our equipment,

decapitated the last courier,

and took the route for himself.

SAR And the Federation
has not intervened?

OS Where are you from?

MALE Here we go.

KAL You have to go now... out the back.
What?

SAR But we've not held up our end
of the deal... your dilithium.

KAL It won't matter
if we're all dead.

OS Please go!

ZAR You must be our friends

from the USS Discovery.

Hello, Kal.

How's the family?

There was no trace
of your vessel

in our databases.

SAR We are an older model.

ZAR Aren't we all?

KAL They've been in contact
with other Federation ships...

who know where they are.

They've been adrift
for a long time.

ZAR Kal?

This is more
than I've heard you speak

since I've known you.

Our visitors must be having a...

garrulous effect.

It must have been
very disorienting for you.

Being adrift.

TLY I'm good.

ZAR Good. We did,

however, register
a freaky signature

right before you got here.

High-energy gamma rays

and gravitational waves.

Do you know how those show up?

Why those show up?

I bet you do.

You look so smart.

Say it.

SAR Our mission is not
of your concern.

ZAR Okay.

Get 'em a drink.

Put it in a flask.

We can drink as we walk.

KAL Where are you taking them?
ZAR Really, Kal,

now you need
to shut the hell up.

They're taking me to their ship.

SAR Uh... no.

ZAR It wasn't a question,
it was a statement.

There's no implied choice.

What is that you're hiding
behind your back, sweetheart?

Huh.

So if they crashed
and they needed you

to repair their communications,

well, that means that they
couldn't repair it themselves.

This is an easy fix

with up-to-date tech.

But you don't have
up-to-date anything.

High-energy gamma

and gravitational waves.

You're time travelers.

I'm sure they really appreciate
that repair job,

Kal.

SAR I gave him no choice.

If you take issue with that,
you may take issue with me.

ZAR I'll take issue with him.

No.

Or you won't live long enough
to watch her die.

Give me those bags.

I want to see
what they brought with them.

Scan the perimeter, make
sure they were stupid enough

to come here on their own.

Aya, contact
the Tellarite Exchange.

I think we're gonna do better
breaking these down for parts.

Vintage tricorder,

communicator.

I'm gonna get these
to the Orions myself.

SAR Zareh?

I am willing
to discuss an exchange.

Those items for the release
of Os'Ir and Tilly.

ALIEN *speaking in Pidgin* We could shave her head. Get something for the hair.

ZAR *speaking in Pidgin* They have a spaceship. There are greater spoils to be had. 

SAR Uh, we will get further
using the common tongue.

ZAR Any captain with
some miles on him...

Even a V'Draysh captain...

Would know Pidgin.

Are you new?

I should offer
my congratulations.

The thing is...

you got no authority here.

Whereas the Burn
was the best thing

that ever happened to me.

SAR Any success you achieve here
will be short-lived,

because we will not permit
your tyranny to stand.

ZAR But here it is, standing.

And you...

and what's left of your ship

aren't enough to do
anything, really.

We're all adrift together.

All that matters now

is dilithium.

Make it through the night,
you'll understand that.

So... shall we?

SAR I have made my position clear.

I will not take you to our ship.

ZAR Principles, I get it.

SAR If dilithium is your priority,

you and I will discuss
a reasonable trade here.

Then we will go back to the ship
to retrieve the dilithium.

ZAR Don't waste my time, or your 72

crew members...
TLY 88.

Our wounded are still our crew.

ZAR ...88 crew members on board
your ship will, you know...

regret it.

You're running out of time

to get the Discovery
off the ground.

The ice...

it's parasitic.

It'll crush the hull.

And eventually everyone inside.
STA I'm at Junction XG11-Beta.
What now?

JET Tube will curve in three meters.

Damaged relay is one meter
beyond that.

NAHN Commander?

Linus said Georgiou left
Deck Eight to help out here?

JET And you believe that?

Georgiou? Helping?

Seriously?

NAHN Damn it.

ZAR 200 units.
SAR 100.

ZAR 175.

SAR 150 units.

ZAR See, that wasn't so hard.

Now you.

I genuinely like you.

And I believe you'll come
back with my property.

So you're gonna go get me

that dilithium.

How about we wait here,

where it's cozy... but be quick,

Ensign.

Come nightfall,

the ice...

well, it does what parasites do.

It infests everything.

I've seen it get
down someone's throat.

But you look like you
can handle yourself.

Maybe you can outrun it.

Explosives help.

You forge yourself a path...

back to us once it's dark.

Okay, sweetheart?

PART THREE

JET Don't forget to disengage
the infuser matrix

when you get there.

STA Do I look like I was hatched
yesterday?

Do I look like a man who has
no idea what he's doing?

JET No, but you do look like a man
who is pain-free

and enjoys mixing metaphors.

Keep at it, Cranky Pants.

NIL They said you might need
some help in here?

JET No. We're at the ne plus ultra

of personal satisfaction.

Say it just like that.

"Ne plus ultra."

You okay up there?

Stamets?

Paul?

NIL Is he okay?

JET Get Culber in here.

PART FOUR 

MAN We found her walking
the perimeter.

GRG Did I interrupt
a critical moment of diplomacy?

ZAR A one-woman tactical response.

V'Draysh has officially reached
its nadir.

GRG A fancy vocabulary
doesn't mean you're scary.

It means you have a thesaurus.

ZAR Shoot her.

GRG No, shoot him.

He's gonna get you killed.

This is when you ask why.

MAN Why?

GRG Glad you asked.
You think you're the only ones

that saw a big ship fall
from the sky?

He knows your competitors

probably detected the ship, and
they're already on their way.

But he hasn't told you, you're
too weak to take them out,

and you don't have
the firepower.

ZAR Enough.
GRG I'm gonna enjoy this new world.

If this idiot can run
a settlement,

then imagine what I can do
in my sleep.

ZAR You got a mouth.

But I got a gun.

We're gonna make this go
real slow.

SAR On my mark, get behind the bar.

ZAR She's intense.

GRG Go!

What you call pain,

I call foreplay.

SAR Georgiou,
you will not harm him further.

That is an order.

GRG Killing him would be a service
to the galaxy.

Even you can't deny that.

This is not who we are.

It is who I am.

TLY Guys.

Daylight's gone.

JET We are running out of time.

Reach out

your hand.

HUGH Jett, I told you

to come see me
if the pain got bad.

JET Ow.

Wasn't gonna leave him.

HUGH What are you doing, Paul?
You're in a Jefferies tube!

What the hell were you thinking?

JET Hey, genius,
he's stuck in a tube

in a ship in a vice, and he's
bleeding all over the place.

Argue about this later.

HUGH Listen, Paul,

everything is gonna be
all right.

We're gonna focus on one moment
at a time, okay, and...

we're gonna do all of this slowly and carefully.
STA Mm-hmm.

HUGH Because I need you out of there
alive, so I can kill you.

JET Stamets,

I know you love the sound of my voice...
STA You realize

this is my nightmare.
JET I live to serve.

Use your multi-tool
to open that compartment.

Take hold of the infuser matrix

and remove it.

Easy breathing, okay?

Try to slow it all down
if you can.

Pull out the damaged

anodyne circuit.

Replace it

with the new one.

Now replace

the infuser matrix.

STA I think I...

Did I do it?

JET Yes, you did.

STA Hugh... thanks.

Jett...

thanks for nothing.

JET Back at you, bobcat.

HUGH Bobcat?

JET I don't know, I'm on drugs.

SAR Commander Georgiou,
give me your weapon.

GRG Move... out of my way.

SAR This degree of violence

is completely
without justification.

GRG If not for me,
you'd both be dead. And he'd

be taking our dilithium
as we speak.

ZAR Shoot them, or you'll
never get another delivery.

I'll take out the silos
that maintain your atmosphere.

Your kids will die gasping.

Gasping!

TLY Sorry, sweetheart.

SAR Give me your weapon now.

GRG I like my weapon.

SAR We defeated Control
and lost lives in the process.

That sacrifice was not
for this, Commander.

I am the acting captain
of the vessel

that brought you here.
Stand down!

OS Kal always believed that you
were out there somewhere...

and that we were part of
the Federation no matter what.

I get now why he
never stopped talking about you.

SAR I am truly sorry

we could not save him.

We will send
more than enough dilithium

for you to reach
the Exchange Kal mentioned

and repair
your mining equipment.

And we will leave you
his vessel.

But it is not our place
to decide his fate.

It is yours.

We have done enough damage here,

and we humbly apologize.

OS You're free to go.

ZAR I won't last the night.

OS You were willing to send her
out there.

Can I give him your pack?

And if I see you reaching
for it...

...I'll shoot you in the back.

ZAR Aah!

GRG And if you manage to live

and decide you're feeling
punitive about this settlement,

I'll come back
and rip your throat out.

OS We'd better get you back
to your ship.

Personal transporter.

Welcome to the future.

TLY Commander, internal comms
are back up and running.

We are good to go.

SAR Lieutenant Detmer?

Lieutenant Detmer,
status report.

DET Impulse engines and maneuvering
thrusters are ready, sir,

but... we've never...
SAR I am well aware that starships

were not designed for liftoff
in this fashion, but...

we have no choice.

Full power, please.

DET Aye, sir.

Full power to thrusters.

SAR Hold us steady, Lieutenant.

Divert all auxiliary power
to main thrusters.

DET Diverting power now, sir.

Something big.

GRG It seems like Zareh's more
powerful friends have found us.

SAR Red alert. Shields up.

OWO I need 18 more seconds.

SAR Lieutenant Detmer,
get us out of here.

DET I'm trying, sir.

SAR Lieutenant, where are we
with those shields?

RHYS Tractor beam. They've
grabbed ahold of our ship.

BRY The comms are back on line,
Commander.

A-And we're being hailed.
OWO Shields are also back on line.

RHYS Weapons armed

and ready.

What do you want us to do?

SAR Open a channel, Mr. Bryce.
We will face

whatever or...

whomever has come for us...

together.

BRY Channel open.

SAR On viewscreen, please.

TLY Oh, my God.
BRY She made it.

BRN Saru.

SAR Michael?

BRN Yeah.

It's me.

I found you.

I've been looking for so long.

SAR You... you're...

You look...

BRN Saru...

I landed here a year ago.

I've been waiting

for all of you...

all this time.

THE END
