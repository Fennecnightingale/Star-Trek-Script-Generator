PART ONE

MAR The lizard men will no longer
be subject to rat oppression!

RAT Aw, they're not oppressed.

We raise them as food.

They-they like it.

LIZARD Well, we are delicious.

MAR - No. You should be free
to do whatever you want.

- What do lizards like to do?
LIZARD - Mm, bask?

MAR - Okay. Then you should
bask without fear of being eaten.

LIZARD Well, that does sounds nice.

RAT This will not stand!

MAR - Buddy, my captain's on the way right now.

It's funny. Normally, I'm, like,
a huge disappointment to her,

but this time
she's gonna be pumped

that I rooted out injustice.

And here comes the praise,

- in five...
CAP - Attention, everyone.

- I'm afraid my ensign
has made a huge mistake.

MAR - What?
CAP - Starfleet is forbidden

from interfering
in your planetary politics.

CAP - You will be free to determine your future

Without our influence.

MAR What? How could you...
Oh, screw the Prime Directive!

CAP Hey.

You are way out of bounds here.

MAR They're eating those guys.


 


What am I supposed to do?

CAP - Report it to me.


Now I have to explain why
there's an interspecies war

on a planet
that was peaceful yesterday!

MAR - Oh, so you're yelling at
me for spreading freedom

Because you don't feel
like filing a report?

CAP - Mariner, I swear,
if you weren't my daughter,

You'd be off the Cerritos.

MAR If I wasn't your daughter,

you wouldn't be such a bitch
all the time!

CAP - That's it. That's it! When
we get back to the ship,

- You are going straight to...
MAR - Yeah, yeah, I know.

Straight to the brig. Shocker.

CAP - Oh, you're not going to the brig.
You're going to therapy.

MAR What?! You think I need therapy?
- What? That's... No!

It's the '80s, dude.

We don't have
psychiatric problems.

CAP You're a loose cannon.

- I don't care how many lizards you save.

You need professional help.

MAR - Dr. Migleemo? Oh,
he's the worst counselor in the fleet!

He just tosses out
nonstop food metaphors!

CAP That's an order, Ensign.

Freeman to Cerritos.

- -One to beam up. -

MAR I don't need therapy!

CAP Okay, look,
will you stop eating these guys

- if we give you food replicators?
RAT Ha. I don't know.
Can they make nutrient pellets?

CAP Yes!

MIGLEEMO - Mariner, this report is

A veritable fruit salad
of insubordination.

MAR I don't want to be here.
I broke the rules.

- I'm supposed to be in the brig.

MIGLEEMO Sorry. Captain's orders.

She wants us to meet every week,

cooking up
some healthy strategies

- to marinate you into the
officer she knows you can be.

MAR I don't want your help!

I want to show the captain
that she's wrong

- and then get put... in... the... brig!


MIGLEEMO Full stop, Beckett.

We need to find an outlet
for all that rage.

- Have you ever made paella?

TEN Nice shot, da Vinci!

DA VINCI -Grazie. 
-Hey, guys.

BOIM Do you mind
if I take over the deck?

I've got a big evaluation

with Captain Freeman
this afternoon.

She's selecting
eager to please candidates

for her advanced diplomacy
workshop.

Problem is, I don't know
how eager to please.

Ugh, I got to practice.

- Computer, load program Boimler seven.

TEN - Ciao, da Vinci.
DA VINCI - Ciao, Tendi.

MAR Ugh, you simulated the crew?

BOIM Yeah, that way,
I can pre-interview

- so I don't make any
mistakes when it's for real.

I uploaded
seven years of entries

from the entire crew's
private logs...

RUTH Aren't those private?

BOIM - ...and it algorithmically created

A perfect simulation
of everyone on the Cerritos.

They'll respond exactly the way
they would in real life.

RUTH - Ah.


Hey, buddy. How's it going?

SHAX Don't talk to me!
I'm pissed off!

RUTH Whoa! Amazing! We had that exact
same conversation an hour ago.

BOIM - Yeah. Ah. All I got to
do is feed it a scenario.

Then the simulated crew
fills in the blanks.

- It'll give me an edge in my interview.


- Ahoy, Cap'n.
CAP - "Ahoy"?

BOIM - See? I just learned not to say that.
MAR Congrats on the brownnosing
program, butt-kisser.

Only you would... Wait.

- This is a perfect simulation?

BOIM What was that?

Hey, hey, what are you doing?

"Interior.
Rickety metal catwalk. Night"?

- Mariner! You can't write
that about the captain.

MAR Why waste this
on some dumb interview prep?

- I'm putting in my own parameters.
BOIM - If Freeman sees this,

- you'll get court-martialed.

What did she ever do to you?

MAR You say I need therapy?

Okay, I'll go to therapy.

BOIM Mariner, don't touch my code!
Don't touch my...

MAR - Therapy...!

PART TWO

BOIM What the hell?
What did you do to my program?

MAR - I made it into an awesome movie.


Oh, I'm gonna work some shit out.

All right!

- ...Ooh, nice font.

BOIM No, no, what are
you talking about? A movie?

What, you wrote out
a whole script in two seconds?

MAR -I just, like,
hit the act breaks,

- Couple set pieces.
BOIM - Set pieces?

MAR The computer's
filling in the rest.

MAR - I made parts for the crew and all of us!


It's gonna be great!

BOIM I don't want to do a movie!

MAR That's okay. You were
kind of a Xon, to be honest.

- You probably weren't
gonna make final cut.

BOIM - Who's Xon?
MAR - Exactly.

TEN Ooh, I've always wanted
to be in a movie!

Can I be the voice of the ship?

- "Red alert! Red alert!"
MAR No, no, I got
the perfect part for you.

- You're gonna love it.
BOIM- Guys!

This is an important work tool,

- not a fun thing to have a good time with.

MAR Boimler, pipe down. Shh.
Come on, the credits.

BOIM I don't want this.

- I just want to prep.
MAR - Well, tough.

- You're just gonna
have to wait till it's over.

Come on, come on, come on,
let's go get into costume.

RUTH Okeydokey!

BOIM I'm not getting in anything.

- Mariner! I want these credits gone now!


Hmm.

Wha?

CAP Yeah!

Happy birthday, Captain!

- I might be getting up in years,

But I still hold
the hydroscoot speed record

back at the Academy!

Captain out! 
-RAN: Whoa!

Get him, Captain!

SHAX Shut up!

I'll kill you! I...

Oh, I can't stay mad.
Good one, Cap'n!

CAP I don't remember
giving you permission

- to scoot with us, Ensign.

BOIM Yeah, actually, I need to
borrow the cap'n

- for a quick interview.
SHAX - It's her birthday!

BOIM Um, can I at least ask
what she likes more,

BOIM - when bridge officers
arrive early or stay late?

CAP A question like that
makes me think

- you're asking the wrong questions.
BOIM Good... to... know.

Sorry to interrupt
your vacation.

CAP This isn't a vacation.

It's important scientific research.

Vacation's over.

ADMIRAL Sorry for the short
notice, Captain Freeman.

CAP - Not a problem at all, Admiral.
- How can we help?
ADMIRAL - We've received a bizarre message

from the leaders of Idlocana 6.

- Their president wanted to thank us
For a wonderful second contact

with the crew
of the San Clemente.

RAN So? What's wrong with that?

ADMIRAL - Starfleet doesn't have a San Clemente.

Whoever second-contacted them
wasn't our ship.

BOIM - What a mystery.

ADMIRAL Uh, whose boy is this?

BOIM Ensign Brad Boimler, sir.

Here to learn.

CAP - This impostor...

You want
the Cerritos to investigate?

ADMIRAL Get in, get me intel,
then get out.

- And, Freeman,
stick to the plan this time.

BOIM If this was actually happening,
they'd send the Enterprise.

But, you know, artistic license.

CAP - Luckily, the Cerritos just
went through some upgrades.

We should be more than suitable
for the task.

BILL The Cerritos is ready
to launch whenever you are.

- Oh.

There she is.

CAP She never fails
to take my breath away.

BOIM - I wish I could kiss her and squeeze her.
CAP - Excuse me?

BOIM Uh, uh, the Cerritos
is a handsome lady.

CAP - You're damn right about that, Boimler.
BOIM Call the ship a handsome lady.

Hmm.

RAN Captain,
we're ready for your command.

CAP - Mm,
time to take this puppy off its leash.

BOIM The selenium rings are
disrupting the sensors, Captain.

SHAX I'm not detecting
any Federation...

- Hold on.


- Enemy vessel decloaking!
CAP - Raise shields!

MAR Like a rat to the bait, Freeman.

Predictable as always.
SHAX - Who is this marauder, Captain?
CAP - I don't know.

MAR I am Vindicta, vengeance personified!

At last, Freeman.

I will bathe in your blood.

BOIM - Oh, boy,
somebody's really laying it on thick.

MAR Behold my three henchmen
of the apo...

- of the Vin-pocalypse.
Tendi, my savage warrior queen

who comes from a long
line of thieving Orion pirates.

TEN Yeah, nobody messes with Orions.

- I'll steal from anyone
and never give it back. Theft!

RUTH And, uh,

B-Bionic 5,

- half man-meat, half robot-meat, all pain.
100% pain.

RUTH Tremble at the sight of the great Vindicta!

MAR And Shempo.

SHEMPO - I'm Shempo. I was supposed
to be played by Boimler.

BOIM Okay, come on.
I don't sound like that.

SHEMPO I love my captain, and I don't
want to be doing this.

BOIM - All right, that's not too far off.
CAP You're posing as Starfleet. Why?

MAR Because I do what I want!
Ugh, you're a jerk, Freeman.

You're nothing
but a propped up errand girl,

blindly licking Starfleet's boot
and begging for heel.

RUTH - Oh! Vindicta got your ass.

CAP Look, there's no need
for theatrics, all right?

- I'm sure you're a reasonable...
SHEMPO - Shempo got you tea, master.

MAR This is coffee!

SHEMPO I was Shempo.

CAP - ...That poor Shempo!

You didn't have to do that.
Are you out of your mind?

MAR Freeman, you disgust me.

- You're a coward who hides behind rank.

You can't even appreciate

your most valuable,
creative thinkers.

- I am Vindicta! Today you die.

CAP This Vindicta
is all over the place.

MAR "Hell is empty,
and all the devils are here.

Our revels now are ended."

RAN Wait,
is she quoting The Tempest?

MAR "Hell is empty,
and all the devils are...

- are here."
CAP - Wait, this is a recording.

It's a distraction.

LEMONTS Winger?

Hi. I'm Lieutenant Lemonts.

- Your one-man show took my breath away.
WINGER Thank you. Thank...

MAR Freeman! Bring me Free...

-God,
these stupid capes. So much fabric.

Bring me Freeman,
and I'll let you live.

LUNDY Never, witch!

RUTH Wow.

Boimler did a good job.

Chief Lundy's accent
was spot-on.

TEN - Yeah,
and the way his face was all blotchy?

RUTH - Wait, do you think Billups is in here?
TEN - Eh, probably.

RUTH So I can say
whatever I want to my boss

- with no consequences?
TEN - Hey, wait! We have to hench!
MAR - Tendi, come on.

- Pirate it up. Take some slaves.
TEN Oh, uh, you know the whole
"Orions taking slaves" thing?

- It's not something I really like to...

LUNDY Dirty Orion.

TEN Lundy!

MAR Give me Freeman!

RAN Attack formation Raptor.

- This isn't my first
overpowered space warlord,

And it won't be my last.

MAR - Ransom,
you think you're better than me?

Better at being
the captain's little dick wig.

RAN You can talk the talk,
but can you... Ow!

-Walk
the walk! She can do both!

- Oh, she's walkin' and talkin'.
BOIM - Sir, quick,

- what's the captain's favorite type of cookie?
RAN - What?!

BOIM - Tell me before you succumb to the pain.

If I were to bake her cookies,

what would be my best bet?

RAN - Cap's got a sweet tooth.
Cookies are a good move.

I've done it myself.
But watch out.

She's allergic to...

BOIM Allergic to what? Ransom!

Allergic to what?!

BILL - At your stations, people.

This is not a drill.

RUTH Billups! Show yourself!

CREWMAN Sir, get down!

BILL Engineering, evacuate!

RUTH Andy Billups!

- You think you're the
best engineer in the fleet.

Well, I've wanted
to say something to you

for a long time.

- You are the best engineer in the fleet!

BILL - Huh?
RUTH - I love how you program subroutines.

It's breathtaking.

It feels so good to say it.

COMPUTER Warning. Hydron levels critical.

BILL Damn it!
We don't have much time.

- Rerouting the vent system
would take a whole team.

RUTH If we bypass the indacontrols

and suppress the sativents,

it should function as a...

- Rudimentary plasma filter.

BILL Wow,
for a random space marauder,

you really know your way
around a starship.

RUTH - Aw, thanks.
Intruder!

SHAX - When you get to hell,

Tell the Pah-wraiths
that Shaxs sent you!

Special delivery
straight from Bajor!

MAR - Ah, shut up.

SHAX Borg head?

BORG - Explosive. -
- -Designation: explosive. -

MAR - ...Oh, look!

Oh, Shaxs's earring.
You have to wear it.

- Come here. Come here.
TEN - Uh, I-I don't know.

Isn't there, like,
religious significance?

- I mean, some of his ear's still on it.
MAR Come on, dude.
Orions are pirates!

Pillaging's your whole thing.

TEN - Okay, stop! It is not my whole thing.

And for your information,
many Orions haven't been pirates

for over five years!

MAR - Okay, sorry. Look, you can just
be my generic warrior henchman.

Come on! Come on,
let's go torture the cat doctor.

Like, really torture
the hell out of her.

TEN - Her name is Dr. T'Ana.

You're way too into this.
This is messed up.

MAR It's the
holodeck. It's not real.

Die! Die!

TEN - What is with you
today? This is not healthy.

- Can we stop the movie?
MAR - No!

No, I'm fine.
This is feeling good.

Come on, let me
just take down the captain,

- and then we can grab tacos.

TEN I don't want to watch you
phaser the captain.

MAR Phaser?

- Oh, it's going to be way worse than that.
TEN I am out of here. Arch.

MAR Hey, come on.

TEN - This isn't you.

MAR It is, too!

PART THREE

CAP Ransom. Shaxs. Anyone, come in.

MAR No one left to hide behind,
Captain.

It's just me and you.

And-and these guys.

CAP You'll never take my ship.

MAR - I don't want your ship.

I want you to stop treating me

like I'm the bad guy
all the time.

- You are the bad guy.

CAP No, I'm not.
Why don't you ever side with me?

I don't even know you.

MAR Exactly!

CAP Oh, my God. You're-you're crazy.


MAR No, this is crazy.


CREWMAN - Sir, her ship.

- The warp core's gone critical.
CAP - Brace for impact!

COMPUTER Warning. Warning.

The ship has crashed. Warning.

CAP Oh, damn it.

- All surviving crew,
emergency evacuation protocol:

Delta Echo.

I'll keep systems functional
for as long as possible.

You can do this. We can do this.

Cerritos strong!

MAR Oh, when are you going
to give up

- -the "loving captain" act?
CAP - It's not an act!

I'm overflowing
with love and affection!

MAR - Oh, shut up!
CAP - You shut up!

RUTH Sir, are you okay?

BILL I'll live,

- -but the rest of the crew...
RUTH- Will be fine.

I initiated a rapid repeating
emergency transport sequence

and beamed the entire crew
before we crashed.

BILL What? But that's not possible.

RUTH No, it's a movie.
You can beam whatever you want.

You can do all sorts
of beaming stuff in a movie!

BILL - What?! That is amazing!

RUTH - I learned it from you, sir.
BILL - Uh... okay.

CAP - What is your problem?!
MAR You've been a jerk
since I was eight!

Why do you have
to be so hard on me?!

CAP - What? I don't know you!

HOLO MARINER Get off my mom, you bitch.

MAR Oh! Wait. What?

- You simulated me in here,
too? Not cool, man!

I got private stuff
in those logs!


HOLO MARINER Emergency transport
on signal now!

CAP - Beckett, no!

MAR Oh, great.
Well, now it's just us.

Yeah, thanks for ruining
the awesome captain-murder

- this was all building to.
We were supposed to fight
on a rickety metal catwalk.


HOLO MARINER Oh. Let me make it up to you.
Double punch!

...Double block.

- Whoa. How did you...?
MAR - I know all your moves

and everything about you.

- I know you dressed up like
Toby Targ every Halloween,

Even when you were too old.

- And I know you actually
love the warp core!


HOLO MARINER Take that back.
The warp core's lame!

MAR You only break rules
because you know

that's what everyone expects
you to do!

- If you really were a badass,
You'd do the hard thing
and just be

a good officer.

They're not casting you
as the villain. You are!

BILL- Hey, I know you might
be a psychotic space raider

Whose boss
just destroyed my ship,

but you...
are all right in my book.

RUTH - That's a book I'd read cover to cover.
Sir, you're the only person
who can see past my mask,

- and knows deep down, I just want
To replace a toranium ops module
with ionizing subcircuits.

BILL - I know this is crazy,
but do you want to just... I don't know...

Run away together,
and we could get our own ship,

and we can buffer the phase coil
whenever we want

or... or realign the matrix.

We can fix the warp engines
on our time.

RUTH - It would be an honor, sir.

T'ANA Godspeed, you crazyfucks.

BOIM - Ugh. Cap'n,
I know you've been through a lot today,

But I made you a platter
of chocolate chip cookies,

and I just want to know
what you think before I give it

- to the real you in real life,
so if you could...

JET The captain's allergic
to chocolate. Assassin!

CAP - Great work, Jet! -

That's the kind
of assassin-tackling

that'll land you a promotion.

CREWMAN FAR-OFF Oh, hell yeah, Jet!

BOIM - Wait, wait. Cap'n, Cap'n,
where do you want me

To see myself in five years?

JET Don't answer that, Captain.
He's playing mind games!

CAP You're the man, Jet.

-Get him out of here. 
JET -Let's go.

BOIM How can I be the man, Cap'n?

I want to be the man!

MAR That's it. Keep up the act.


HOLO MARINER Oh, you know so much about me,

but you missed one big thing.

MAR Oh, yeah, here we go... time
for one of your snarky jokes.


HOLO MARINER - Yeah, I may hate protocol,

But I don't hate this ship.

I don't hate the crew.
I work with my best friends.

- The captain's my mom. I
would do anything for her.

MAR Oh, come on.
No, you hate the captain.

You complain about her nonstop.

- It's like your whole thing!

HOLO MARINER Yeah, I mean,
she's hard on me, right?

She's the captain,
and I'm a pain in the ass.

But if she kicked me off
the Cerritos,

- I would be done in Starfleet.
She's watching out for me
the only way she knows how:

- in a fucked up, overbearing, mom way.

MAR Oh, please. The only person
you care about is yourself.


HOLO MARINER - Okay, well,
then why did I let you kick my ass

To buy time for everyone
to get off the ship

before the self-destruct
timer went off?

MAR - Wait. What?-

BOIM No, no, no, no. No, no, no! Aah!

No!

MAR Wow. I can't believe I just
got my ass kicked by myself

- and just... Wait.
I guess I like working
on the ship and...

- Oh, my God. Therapy works. Guys,
therapy works!

Honestly,
that was way more therapeutic

- than I thought it would
be. I worked through a lot.

PART FOUR 

RUTH I feel great, too. I just wish

I could tell the real Billups
how I feel about him.

MAR - Why don't you, man? He's right there.


RUTH Nah, I wouldn't want
to bother him. I mean,

look at him.
Dude's a stone-cold badass.

MAR Hey, T. I owe you an apology.

- The whole Orions-pirate thing.
I-I feel really bad. I'm sorry
if I put you in a weird spot.

TEN Thanks. I appreciate it,
and the truth is,

a lot of Orions are capitalist,
hyper-libertarian,

gangster pirates,
just not this one.

-That's why I'm here. 

MAR -Oh, well, thanks

For having my back in there.
I owe you one.

TEN Um, so, do you want
to maybe go sit

- and look at the warp core with me?

MAR Wow, so lame. Yes. Let's do it.

RUTH We talking warp core?
Ooh, baby, I'm in.

CAP - Mariner.
MAR - Hey, Cap. Sorry about earlier today.

- I was way out of line.
Thanks for looking out.

Later, skater.

CAP - "Later skater"? I know
she's up to something!

What did she tell you?

MIGLEEMO Captain, you know I can't share

- what your crew tells me.

That'd be a real ethical pickle.

CAP What?!
If she's planning something,

- I have a right to know.
MIGLEEMO  - Carol,

- you're being a pineapple right now.

CAP Ugh! Stop referencing foods!

BOIM Okay. No more distractions.
I just need to know

what to wear to the interview.

Computer, continue program.

- Hey, Cap'n, do you like turtlenecks
- Or just standard uniform?
CAP - Against insurmountable odds.

Oh, sorry. You got something
going on here. I'll wait.

- As captain,
it was an honor serving beside her.

As a mother, it was a privilege
to call Mariner my daughter.

BOIM - -Wait. What? -That's right.
CAP Mariner was my daughter
the whole time.

It's a secret
we didn't want anyone to know.

BOIM - Uh,
uh... 
CAP -And if someone had ever

Found out she was my baby girl,

I don't know
what I would have done.

Probably
kicked them off the ship,

- maybe even court-martialed
them right out of Starfleet.

I was being crazy.

Thank goodness

- nobody ever found out.
BOIM - Computer, end program!

MAR Ooh!

- Hey, nerd,
we're going to go stare at the warp core.

You want to...? Whoa. You okay?

BOIM - Yeah.
MAR - All right, whatevs. Hey.

- Good luck with the interview.
You're gonna do great.

CAP ...So, you're interested

In the advanced
diplomacy workshop.

Where do you see yourself
negotiating peace in five years?

BOIM - I... uh...
CAP Just take a breath and say the
first thing that comes to mind.

BOIM - Mariner.
CAP - Mariner what?!

BOIM - Uh... is hot? 
CAP - Excuse me?!

BOIM - Uh, I don't know! She's not hot!
- She's nasty!

CAP - Ensign Boimler didn't bother
to prepare for interview. Terrible.

MAR Revenge!

DA VINCI ...Not-a today.

Not-a on-a da Vinci's watch.

Chirp.

THE END
