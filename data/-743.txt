PART ONE 

BRN Personal log,
Commander Michael Burnham.

My mother taught me
the greatest mysteries

come in threes.

Birth, life, death.

The past,
the present and future.

That's where the Red Angel
is from.

We now have confirmation,
thanks to Mr. Saru.

The angel is humanoid
and wearing an exosuit

made of future technology
we've never seen.

But whose future?

And why?

The only person who may be able to answer these questions

is the one person
nobody can find.

two months before they appeared.

PKE Which presumes the angel
shared them with him

for a damn good reason.

BRN According to his cognitive
tests, he had a mental break.

PKE So, either the
angel broke him

or chose him because
he was broken.

BRN Well, I don't like
either option.

PKE Maybe, uh, it showed him a
future he couldn't process.

BRN We know that he ran
from the psychiatric unit

on Starbase 5.

And we know the shuttle
that he stole

disappeared somewhere
in the Mutara sector.



PKE Any leads?
BRN None.

But if the Federation
and Section 31

are still looking
for him...

I think we need
to find him first, sir.

I need permission
to go to Vulcan.

I haven't spoken to my mother
or father in some time.

PKE Sarek's on the
Federation task force.

If he had any
information, we'd know.

BRN If he did, yes, we would.

My mother, on the other hand,

she hasn't always seen
eye-to-eye with him

when it comes to Spock.

PKE You've already packed
your bag, haven't you?

BRN Id never do that without
your permission, sir.

PKE Take your leave, Commander.

Good luck, and hurry back to us.

BRN Thank you, sir.
Where are you headed?

PKE Were sticking around Kaminar
for a while longer.

The signal that appeared
with the Angel

left behind traces
of residual decay

that Starfleet's tasked us
with analyzing.

Hopefully, it'll tell us
when and where

in the future it came from.

BRN Then, good luck
to you, too, Captain.

PKE Status report, Mr. Saru.

SAR The sensors have detected
the same spike

of tachyon particles
Admiral Cornwell's team recorded

after our expedition
to the asteroid.

TLY Sir? Sir, these readings
cant be accurate.

5,000 parts
per cubic micron?

PKE That's a lot.
TLY Ah, outside
a supernova,

no ones ever recorded
densities at this level.

Its freaking amazing.

SAR Excuse me?

TLY I'm sorry, sir.
You know how I get

around violations of causality.

Plus, you said that I shouldn't
curse when I was on duty.

PKE What kind of power
source could generate

that amount of
tachyon particles?

TLY Well, the technology may not
have been invented yet.

PKE Lets determine more about
this possible power source

beyond "freaking amazing."

SAR I am attempting to launch
a probe into the anomaly

that may help us determine where
in the future it came from.

But the extreme
tachyon interference

is disrupting
our targeting systems.

PKE Well, lets get closer,
then, shall we?

Helm,
forward, one-quarter impulse.

Airiam, assist Mr. Saru
with analysis, please.

ASH Wheres Burnham?
PKE On personal leave.

ASH Why wasn't I informed?

PKE Because "personal"
means personal.

ASH Captain, if Burnham's absence
is related

to Spock's disappearance,
you owe me an explanation.

PKE I owe you?

ASH Owe me.

PKE Uh, Mr. Tyler,

the chair outranks the badge.

BRY The comms are off-line, sir.

RHYS Tactical systems
have failed, too.

PKE Talk to me, Owo.
OWO Captain,

these readings don't
make any sense.

The computers seem caught
in some kind of loop.

SAR Computers do not do well
with temporal distortions,

if that is what
we are dealing with.

TLY Oh, what the frick?

ASH You owe me an explanation.

PKE (echoing) I owe you?
The chair outranks the badge.

DET Captain, dead ahead.

PKE What am I looking at?
SAR It appears to be

a rift in
space-time, Captain.

Full reverse.

TLY S-Sorry.

OWO Systems back online.

PKE Okay, lets not do that again.

Mr. Saru,

load your probe onto
a shuttle, Ill pilot it

close enough to target the
anomaly and launch from there.

SAR Sir?
PKE Test pilot

was my first assignment
in Starfleet.

I know
Discovery's
shuttles
better

than anyone else on board.

SAR Well, I have no doubt, sir,

but you are vital personnel.

PKE I'm also the most qualified.

Are you familiar with the term
"bad penny," Mr. Tyler?

ASH Captain, you can keep me
in the dark about Burnham,

but not when it comes to
intelligence about these signals

or the Red Angel. I'm your
official liaison to Section 31.

You have to deal with me.

PKE And what about
the Klingon inside you?

ASH You are aware
the war is over, right?

PKE My problem isn't
with Klingons.

You killed
a member of this crew.

At least
your shadow did-- Voq.

ASH Sorry, but there's no way
to get rid of him, sir.

PKE I know the feeling.

VULCAN OFFICIAL Starfleet shuttle,
identify yourself.

BRN This is
Commander Michael Burnham.

Requesting permission to land

at the residence
of Ambassador Sarek.

VULCAN OFFICIAL Is this official
Starfleet business?

BRN I'm not here
as a Starfleet officer.

I'm here as his daughter.

VULCAN OFFICIAL Permission granted.

(thunder rumbling)

AMD (echoing) My name is Amanda.

My name is Amanda.

Whats yours?
BRN Michael.
(echoing) Michael.

AMD Do you want to meet our son?

Do you want
to meet our son?

(laughs)

SPK You are amused
by your own error?

BRN Yeah.

That is... illogical.

Emotions confuse me.

BRN Me, too.

(chuckles softly)

AMD I'm so glad
you're home, Michael.

BRN Spock is still missing.

Mother, I need your help.
AMD Yes, we know.

Sarek's been like that
for hours.

From the moment
your father heard

that your brother
disappeared,

hes been practicing Tokmar
every day.

BRN I've never seen
Tokmar
performed before.

Ancient Vulcans believed
it could bring

lost souls back home.

AMD It isn't working.

BRN I think its more than that.

Sarek has the most disciplined,
logical mind I know.

If it isn't working,
there has to be a reason.

I think you know what it is.

AMD I haven't heard from him.

BRN The longer hes on the run,
the harder it'll be for him.

AMD Yes, I can see
the logic in that.

BRN No matter how angry
you are with me,

you have to know
how much I love him.

Spock is my brother,
I'll protect him.

AMD Even if I knew where he was...

there is no way
that I would ever

turn him in to be tried for
murders he did not commit.

BRN Mother.

AMD I have not seen him.

BRN My whole life, you've
told me the truth.

That's how I know
you're lying.

If you know where he is,
let me help him.

You have to. You have
to let me help him.

(thunder rumbling)

AMD Spock is not how
you remember him.

(indistinct comm transmission)

PKE Shuttle 5 approaching
the anomaly.

Now at minute five, and still
no signs of temporal effects.

Ready to move us another
600 kilometers closer

and re-acclimate.

TLY Like a diver rising
to the surface.

Don't want to get the
"time bends," sir.

PKE Time bends. I like that.

TLY Oh, everything sounds
cooler when you put

"time" in front of it.

PKE Oh. Getting readings

off the rift-- time rift.

ASH Transmitting to you now,
Discovery.

SAR Captain Pike,
when targeting the anomaly

with the probe, make sure
to avoid the aperture.

The sooner you can launch,
the better.

You are on the clock, sir.

PKE Acknowledged, Mr. S...
Acknowledged...

(echoing):
Acknowledged, Mr. Saru.

Acknowledged, Mr. Saru...
BRY Vocal analysis shows

that all three
acknowledgments

are the same
transmission, sir.

SAR Captain, you are experiencing
temporal distortions.

Do not proceed any closer.

Launch the probe
from your current position.

PKE Thank you, Mr. Saru.
Registering full stop.

Entering coordinates
and launch sequence.

(Tyler screaming)

ASH No!

Something wrong, sir?

Sir?

PKE Launch the probe.

OWO Captain, there's a temporal
shock-wave headed right at you.

PKE Copy that.
Engaging evasive maneuvers.

Hold on.

(choppy):
Altering course for...

(continues indistinctly)

PART TWO

OWO I've lost them in the time rift.

BRY I cant locate them anywhere.

No response on any channel.

No transponder reading
from the shuttle, either.

SAR Mr. Rhys?

Do you detect any debris
from an explosion?

RHYS I cant see anything, sir.

The sensors are not responding.

DET If I move the
ship any closer,

the same thing could
happen to us, sir.

SAR Officers, our mission has now
changed from research to rescue.

The captain and Tyler
are counting on us.

Owosekun, rectify our sensor
issues by accounting for

varying tachyon levels manually.

Rhys, continue studying
the anomaly.

We must understand the internal
dynamics of the phenomenon

in order to recognize
deviations.

RHYS Because those deviations
might be our missing shuttle.

SAR Correct.

TLY The radiation will be
lethal in five hours.

Do you really think well
be able to locate them?

SAR Well, the question may not be
where they are, but when.

We must assume that time does
not move inside the anomaly

along a strictly linear course.

TLY No, it jumbles it all up,
like a blender.

Which makes...

finding the captain
and Tyler... impossible.

SAR For us, perhaps, but...

as we discovered when
Mr. Mudd attacked us,

Commander Stamets has a unique
relationship with time.

The tardigrade DNA
protects him

from the effects
of temporal distortions.

Perhaps he can see
something we cannot.

TLY Yes, sir.

SPK (muttering) Constructionism combines
the epistemological thesis

about what can be known
with a meta-philosophical view

on the nature
of philosophical questions.

Formal logic utilizes
plausible reasoning

and inductive methods
organized into subsystems.

The most important of these
systems is classical logic...

(continues muttering)

The most important of these
systems is classical logic...

Formal logic utilizes
plausible...

But even if their premises
are true...

All inductive arguments are
therefore deductively invalid.

The premises of an inductive
argument do not entail the truth

of the arguments conclusion.

In deductive logic,
the methods of reasoning

and the procedure for finding
evidence are investigated.

In deductive logic,
the methods of reasoning

and the procedure for finding
evidence are investigated.

Only if it is impossible
for the conclusion to be false

while the premises are all true.

(continues indistinctly)

BRN Spock, its me.

(muttering)

SPK (muttering) A deductive argument is one

that aims to show
its conclusions must be true.

(overlapping muttering)

(Spock laughing and muttering)

BRN Spock.

Spock, can you hear me?

Spock.

SPK To say that a logical
construction is valid

is to say that the premises
are true...

BRN Its Michael.
SPK A deductive argument is

one that aims to show
its conclusion must be true.

(Spock continues)
BRN How long has he been like this?

AMD Two days.

I couldn't go to Sarek.

He would weigh the needs
of the many against the...

(muttering)

BRN We've got to get
him to a doctor.

SPK ...is classical logic.

AMD Every avenue leaves a trail.

BRN Mother, hes just repeating
the First Doctrines of Logic.

AMD Hes trying to ground himself.

SPK 8-4-1-9-4-7.

8-4-1-9-4-7.

(echoing):
8-4-1-9-4-7.

8-4-1-9-4-7. 8-4-1-9-4-7.

(echoing):
8-4-1-9-4-7.

8-4-1-9-4-7.

(echoing)

BRN What are those numbers?

AMD I don't know, I've
tried looking.

BRN Are they coordinates?
Are they command codes?

Are they birthdays?
AMD I don't know,

I've tried everything.

BRN We have to get him
to a hospital.

AMD You're not taking him anywhere.

BRN Mother, if he were
a full-blooded Vulcan,

these emotions would have
driven him insane by now.

You cannot keep him here.

AMD Spock came to me for help,

and I will never turn him in.

And under Federation
law, I don't have to.

BRN Please.

Please don't do this.

MD As the wife of the
Vulcan ambassador,

I have the legal authority
to invoke diplomatic immunity

in order to shield my
son from extradition.

SRK Unless the ambassador objects.

PKE The sensors are useless.

ASH You're wasting your time.

We need a fixed point to target
if were gonna navigate

by dead reckoning.
PKE You telling me how to fly now?

ASH Captain, I'm not the enemy here.
PKE You got any experience
behind the stick?

Take it.

(alarm sounding)

Adjust heading to 1-90-mark-2.

That's the signal that
brought us to Kaminar.

ASH How is this possible?

It disappeared before
Discovery
arrived.

PKE Were being pulled back in time.

Or worse,

were traveling
through past, present,

and future all at once.

We could be together
for all eternity.

ASH Unless the rift closes
while were still here.

In which case,
eternity might not last as long

as we think.

PKE Wait. I have to assume

Discovery's
coming through
the anomaly for our flight path.

Release the plasma
from the nacelles.

Three bursts,
five minutes apart.

The thrusters will ignite
the fuel.

ASH All due respect, sir,
we need this fuel.

PKE That wasn't a suggestion,
Mr. Tyler.

ASH Captain, every decision
you've made so far

is about your guilt
at sitting out the war.

You're trying to
prove your bravery

at the expense of our lives.

PKE That's enough!

You will release the plasma, or
when we get back to the ship--

and we will get back
to the ship--

Ill throw you in the brig.

And then you can
think about guilt

while awaiting court-martial

for failing to follow
a direct order.

Do you understand,
Specialist Tyler?

ASH Initiating plasma abort, sir.

STA The captain is lost?

How the hell did that happen?

TLY Well, he and Tyler got
swept up in a time rift.

STA A time rift?
Whats a...?

Wait, are these radiation
levels accurate?

TLY They'll reach lethal
exposure in four hours.

STA And Saru wants me to plot
the shuttles trajectory

by using the mycelial network
as a constant?

TLY Well, since you have
Tardigrade DNA in your system,

it should be a piece
of cake for you.

STA Beyond the event horizon,
time exists

all at once, which makes
finding them like...

catching a grain of sand
in a hurricane,

using a pair of tweezers.

TLY Hmm.

SPK To say that a logical
construction is valid...

SRK You lied to me, Amanda.

I assume you hid our son
in this sacred crypt

because it contains
katra stones,

which blocks any outside
telepathic link with him.

AMD You assume correctly.

SRK Your behavior was
impulsive and shortsighted.

AMD How dare you.

I accepted this life
because I love you.

And now Spock pays
the price...

...like he always has.

This is my worst fear.

Do you know that
I used to read
Alice
to Spock

when he was a little boy, before
Michael came into the house?

"...which way I ought
to go from here?

"That depends a good deal

on where you want to get to,"
said the Cat.

Do you know why

I read him that book?

Because Spock had
difficulties.

Human difficulties.

Learning, reading,

writing.

The Vulcans called it
Ltak Terai.

A temporary complication
remedied at the Learning Center.

No.

He had no support.

Nobody wanted to help
a half-Vulcan child

with a learning disability
he'd inherited from his mother.

And in order to
save our son,

I began to read him a story
about how to survive

when up is down
and left is right.

SRK Your obsession with a book

about chaos has done a
disservice to our children.

AMD They were the ones

who were on both sides
of the looking glass.

Not you, Sarek.

You never truly
respected humanity.

SRK If that were true, I would
have married a Vulcan.

AMD Would you have left Vulcan
for me?

No, you wouldn't.
I sacrificed everything

for our family.

SRK That does not change
the fact that you have

harbored a fugitive,

which is a flagrant
abuse of my authority.

AMD I don't live
under your authority.

I'm your wife

and I'm your partner.

Try again, husband.

SPK "But I don't want to
go among mad people,

"remarked Alice.

"Oh, you cant help that,
said the Cat.

"Were all mad.
(mouthing)

"I'm mad. You're mad.

"But how do you know I'm mad?
said Alice.

You must be, said the Cat."

SRK He is regressing.

If Spock relinquishes all logic,
hes lost.

BRN Father.

I believe this is connected
to the Red Angel.

Spock saw it.

And the seven signals,
before they appeared to us.

SRK You hid this from me.

BRN I wanted to find him first.

I was trying to save his life.

SRK Amanda, you
are correct.

Spock needs help,

which is why
you
must deliver
him to Captain Leland.

BRN Throwing him at the mercy
of Section 31

might be throwing him
to the wolves.

AMD You want to deliver our son to
the people that are after him?

SRK The sole reason they must be
after Spock is because his mind

contains answers the Federation
desperately needs.

Outside of this room,

no one is more
motivated to heal Spock

than Section 31.

AMD And what are they gonna do
when they're done with him?

Lock him in jail
and throw away the key?

SRK Not if he is innocent.

And there is another
logical reason

Michael must do this.

Your career
as a Starfleet officer

will be jeopardized once again

if you fail
to fulfill your duty.

SPK ...view on the nature
of philosophical questions.

SRK And I am not prepared

to lose both of our
children on the same day.

SPK ...the framework of this system,

the relation
of logical sequence is...

PART THREE 

PKE Status report, Mr. Tyler.

ASH Plasma levels at 30%,
shields down to 23.

PKE We're circling closer
to the aperture.

ASH So you got what you came for.

PKE Hows that?

ASH Dire straits, high stakes.

Low probability
of surfacing.

And the bonus
of taking me down with you.

PKE I am trying to get us
out of here.

Arguing with each other
isn't going to make it...

(grunts)

ASH What is that?

PKE Its our probe.

But somehow
it got an upgrade.

BRN N-C-I-A-9-3, do you read?

I'm Commander Michael Burnham,
and my passenger,

Lieutenant Spock, requires
immediate medical attention.

MAN Alter course to 1-3-1-mark-7

and power down your thrusters.

SPK (echoing) 8-4-1-9-4-7.

8-4-1-9-4-7. 8-4-1-9-4-7.

8-4-1-9-4-7.

8-4-1-9-4-7. 8-4-1-9-4-7.
GRG I'm impressed

you found Spock
before we did,

and that you used your
own mother to do it.

I would have enjoyed
manipulating mine like that.

If she'd lived
a little longer.

BEN Did you kill her?

GRG Its a blur.

LEL We've given Commander Spock

a sedative for this procedure.

BRN Captain Leland, what is that?

LEL It allows us to scan and repair
Spock's neural impulses.

Control wouldn't proceed

if there was any risk
to your brother.

Give us the room, please.

(door whooshes open)

That includes you.

(male voice speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

(door whooshes shut)

(door whooshes open)

I hope Spock is innocent.

If he isn't, my gut tells me
he may not have been himself.

I know how painful
this is for you.

You need answers.
So do we.

We will find them together.

I made that promise
to Ambassador Sarek,

and I'm making you
the same promise.

BRN Thank you, Captain.

LEL Is there anything
you can tell us about

your brothers psychological
makeup that may help us?

(sighs)

BRN Hes brilliant, curious.

When he was little, he seemed
to have fewer filters.

Everything reached him.

My mother said he
had a condition

called
Ltak Terai
as a child.

LEL I've heard the term.

Its a spatial and order
dysphagia.

Much like dyslexia.

Pretty common on Earth.

Not so much on Vulcan.

I received permission
from Admiral Cornwell

to extend your leave.

However, our facilities
are classified.

Section 31 doesn't allow
non-assigned personnel

to stay on board.

BRN I'd rather not
leave him alone, sir.

LEL You wont be.

Hell get the best care
the Federation has to offer.

We both need him
to get better, Burnham.

Look, we're less than four hours
away from Starbase 23.

Spock will be with the doctors
until then, anyway.

Go ahead to the Starbase.

Get a bit of rest.

Listen, the best thing you can
do for your brother right now

is to take care
of yourself.

He's gonna need you.

(door whooshes shut)

(whispering):
BRN Spock, can you hear me?

(shuddering breaths)

Ltak Terai...

You must have been so lonely.

Knowing you, you made

something beautiful
out of those mirrored images.

SPK (echoing) 8-4-1-9-4-7.

8-4-1-9-4-7.

8-4-1-9-4-7.

SPK/BRN 8-4-1-9-4-7.

7-4-9...

BRN 1-4-8.

The numbers are backwards.

The numbers
are backwards.

RHYS Sir, I found something.

Residual traces of three
deuterium plasma burns.

I think its the captain.

SAR Well, why burn off valuable fuel

if you are being
pulled into a rift?

RHYS It's an old trick they taught us
in flight school

to alert search parties.

Figured its something a
former test pilot would do.

SAR Well done, Mr. Rhys.

Send those positions
to Commander Stamets.

STA I'm calculating
the shuttles trajectory.

Not in three-dimensional space,

but using
corresponding coordinates

within the mycelial network.

TLY Well, my fourth-dimensional
math must be off.

This looks like
you just sprayed the monitor

with grated Parmesan.

This plasma burn looks
like it happened a week ago,

this one yesterday,
and the third one...

STA Eight minutes from now.
No, your math is spot-on.

Nonlinear temporal progression
is a mind bender.

Oh. That's not good.

It's drifting toward
the rifts aperture.

TLY Well, why would it do that?

STA Well, the currents in there
work like water

swirling down a drain.

The temporal distortions

make spatial orientation
meaningless to the human brain.

Unless...

you have Tardigrade DNA.

Come on, Tilly.

PKE Engaging external shielding.

It's trying to
find a way in.

ASH Some of the metals
in this thing

don't even register
on the periodic chart.

And atomic decay measurements
indicate the probes core

has aged... 500 years.

(thumping)

PKE So, what, it-it traveled
500 years in the future,

someone messed with it
and sent it back to us?

ASH Yeah. But why?

(grunts)

(screaming)

PKE Tyler!

(Tyler shouting in Klingon)

ASH No!

PKE Hold still.

(grunting)

TLY Where are we going?
STA To the transporter room.

I need to be on that shuttle.

I can fly them out. Move!

TLY Sorry, but calculating
transporter coordinates

from here onto a moving shuttle
inside of a temporal distortion?

STA It doesn't look distorted to
me, Tilly. Its just anomalous.

TLY But if your
calculations are off

by even a fraction,
you will end up...
STA Very dead,

which is why you'll be running
the transporter on my mark.

TLY Oh, man, I knew
you were gonna say that.
(door whooshes open)

No, w-w-wait, can-can
we just stop for a second

and think about this?

What if we send
the PADD over first

and see if it...
STA We don't have time.

In one minute,
the shuttle will leave

the triangulation zone
and well never

be able to find it again.
TLY Right, but, no...

There must be another...
STA Tilly.

Trust the math.

More importantly,
trust yourself.

I wouldn't let just anyone
beam me in and out of time.

TLY Okay.

(metallic trilling)

PART FOUR 

ASH Captain.

Excuse me.
PKE Stamets?

STA I'm actually here
ten minutes from now.

Admittedly confusing, but

don't worry, I'm gonna
get us out of here

by using the network
as a road map.

PKE Mm. Oh.

TLY Did it work?
Is Commander Stamets all right?

OWO I've got the shuttle.
Its exiting the anomaly.

SAR On screen.

What... is that?

STA Discovery,
this is Stamets.

We've picked up a hitchhiker;
its a probe

but with a few
modifications.

And in addition
to it trying to kill us,

its accessing our
ships data core.

SAR Yellow alert.
TLY We have your,
uh, shuttle screens

mirrored here, sir-- whoa.

ARIM The probe is searching
our computers

at incredible speeds;
I will attempt to lock it out.

PKE Well try on our end.

ASH Grab the Fahrenheit tools.

PKE Rhys, can you target
the probe

without destroying
the shuttle?

RHYS Not with your shields so low.

SAR Can we beam them out?

OWO They're too near the rift to get

a lock, sir.

STA Hold on, Ill move us
closer to
Discovery.

(power faltering)

Plasma's gone. Were in drift.

Its pulling us
back into the rift.
(grunts)

GRG I've disabled
the cameras

for 60 seconds,
so listen closely.

Your instincts are
correct, Michael.

That machine is a
memory extractor.

It will destroy
your brothers mind.

BRN Why should I believe you?

GRG Leland is just a puppet
following orders.

And I didn't
think you'd want

your brothers
blood on your hands.

BRN So you're telling me this out
of the goodness of your heart?

GRG No, the goodness of yours.

I know so much more about
you than you can imagine.

But that's for
another time.

Right now,
you're going to attack me,

then rescue Spock,
which is good for you.

And that will make
Leland look bad,

which is good for me.

Ten seconds, Michael.

So, what will it...?
(grunts)

(coughs)

BRN Trying to make it look good.

(coughs)
GRG Not bad.

Once more, with feeling.

(grunting)


SAR Captain Pike, we cannot get
a transporter lock

for you on our end,
and we will lose you

to the rift in 34 seconds.

PKE Commander, can you calculate

the transporter coordinates
for
Discovery
remotely?

STA Uh... probably?

PKE Great. Saru, I'm blowing
up the shuttle manually.

Engaging self-destruct sequence.

Better hurry with those
calculations, Mr. Stamets.
STA Sending
transport coordinates now.

OWO Coordinates received.
Standing by to transport.

PKE Self-destruct activated.

STA Owo! Beam us out.
Owo, beam us out!

Now, now, now, now,
now, now, now!

(Tyler screaming)

SAR (echoing) Commander Airiam, are they safe?

Commander Airiam,
are they safe?

Commander Airiam?

ARIM They are securely on board.

FEMALE VOICE (over P.A.) Attention, all personnel.

Security breach
in main shuttle bay.

Security breach
to the shuttle bay.

Standard detainment protocols
remain in...

(power surging)

PKE Thank you, Mr. Saru.

Thank you, everyone, for, uh...

well, our lives.

TLY Don't thank us yet, sir.

A shockwave from
the shuttle explosion

is about to hit us
with a... time tsunami.

That ones not as
cool as it sounds.

PKE Detmer, maximum warp.
Get us out of here.

DET Aye, sir.

PKE (sighs) Its good to be back
in the chair.

You should probably get that
checked out.

ASH On QonoS, we wouldn't even
bother to bandage it.

PKE You know...

if it wasn't for you,

that think would've
sliced me in two.

ASH Just... instinct.

PKE No, its more than that,

and I am grateful.

And, Mr. Tyler,

you may have been right
about why I, uh...

why I gave myself
the mission.

And a few others,
if I'm being honest.

ASH Your plasma burn was
the right call, sir.

Like you said,
you were the most qualified.

PKE Mr. Saru, have you analyzed

the probes attack
on our systems?

SAR Well, analyzing, sir.

It will take us time to discover
what it was looking for.

PKE That probe came from the future
and tried to kill us.

The Red Angel comes
from the future.

SAR Captain, are you suggesting
it may share

the probes hostile intent?

PKE Mr. Tyler has broached
that possibility before,

and today I think
he might have a point.

ASH Whether the Red Angel is
here to end something

or start something,
one things for sure.

Were in the middle
of a fight for the future.

PKE Always, Mr. Tyler.

We are always in a fight
for the future.

LEL You let her go.

GRG She overpowered me.
Check the cameras.

LEL Where is she taking Spock?

GRG They're family.
Maybe they're going

on a picnic.

LEL Georgiou...

do not overestimate
your value here.

GRG Who do you think
you're fooling, Leland?

You need me... to keep Burnham
from finding out the truth.

LEL The truth?

GRG You're responsible for
the death of her parents.

LEL Mind your manners.

GRG You're no longer
calling the shots.
