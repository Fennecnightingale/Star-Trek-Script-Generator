PART ONE 

ADM Scans on my end were negative.

I dont think anyone
tracked me here.

SAR Our scans were clear
as well, Admiral Cornwell.

Welcome aboard.

ADM Wish it were under better
circumstances, Mr. Saru.

PKE - You've looked into my concerns
about Section 31? 
ADM - I have.

But before we get into
any of that,

I need to speak privately
with Mr. Spock.

PKE They were going to torture him

with technology thats
never even been seen

by the rest of Starfleet.

For all we know, they
couldve killed him.

Not to mention, they
ordered their agent

to sabotage our spore drive.

ADM I'm aware of the accusations.

PKE Whatever Section 31 said,

it's not prudent to trust them.

You may think were all
on the same team...

ADM You have no idea
what Im thinking.

Where's Spock?

ADM Beginning cerebral mapping.

Try not to move.

Okay. Lets begin.

State your rank,
position, and assignment.

SPK My rank is Lieutenant.

And I am a science officer

assigned to the starship Enterprise.

ADM Lieutenant Spock, do you intend
to be truthful with me today?

SPK I do.

ADM Good.

Did you recently leave
a psychiatric facility

without permission?

SPK No.

I committed myself
to the facility;

therefore, required no
permission to leave it.

ADM When you left, did you murder
Starfleet personnel

in the process?

SPK I did not.

ADM - Did you kill them in self-defense?
SPK - I did not.

ADM Can you explain to me
why you did kill them?

SPK Admiral, I believe
I've been quite clear.

I did not kill anyone at all.

BRN He's innocent.

I know Tyler.

He wouldn't sabotage
our spore drive.

He's loyal to Starfleet.

PKE He's loyal to Section 31.

They seem to have
a different agenda

than Starfleet these days.

BRN Let me talk to him. Please.

PKE No contact. Thats an order.

I understand this
must be difficult

given your history with him.

But our mission takes priority.

Your brother is the only one

whos had direct contact
with the Red Angel.

I need you to help
him figure out

who it is and what they want.

- Can I count on you to do that?
BRN - Of course, sir.

And I'll prove that
Tyler is innocent.

You can count on that, too.

ADM How did you escape
the psychiatric facility

if not with violence?

SPK I performed what is
colloquially referred to

as a "Vulcan nerve pinch."

A disabling maneuver never known
to inflict permanent harm.

ADM You committed yourself
to the facility.

Why escape at all?

SPK I did not initially
believe the visions

shown to me by
the Red Angel were real,

and therefore questioned
my sanity.

Once I learned I was sane,
to have remained confined

would have been unproductive.

ADM Do you have any idea
why the Red Angel

chose you to receive
these visions?

APK I do not.

I have asked myself
that question many times.

ADM Any idea what they mean?

SPK Someone or something

is going to end
all sentient life in the galaxy.

ADM And when you say the end
of all sentient life,

- you mean...
SPK - I mean precisely that.

No humans, no Vulcans,
no Federation.

No conscious life of any kind.

BRN Admiral...

If I may...

I believe him.

And I know for a fact
he didn't murder anyone.

ADM Well, perhaps youre defending
him because you're his sister.

BRN Not by blood.

He's telling the truth
about the murders.

Or he believes he is.

SAR Uh, forgive me, Admiral,

but I fail to understand
your doubt.

Is the test
you administered inaccurate?

ADM The test is 100% accurate.

But so is this...

(yelling, grunting)

(yelling)

(screams)

PKE Thats not the Spock I know.

It must have been doctored.

ADM I verified the source codes.

The images come
straight from Psych.

The admirals who run Section 31

haven't responded to me in weeks.

Their threat-assessment
system, Control,

isn't accepting my
data-input codes anymore.

PKE Any idea who programmed it
to shut you out?

ADM Admiral Patar. She's
a logic extremist.

Frankly, I find her

fanaticism... worrying.

Once the signals appeared,

she started lobbying Starfleet
to turn its decision-making

entirely over to Control.

Control is a great resource.

Every Starfleet admiral
feeds data into it.

We consider its recommendations,

but final decisions
always include our experience

and instinct.

SAR But to raise your concerns
with Starfleet,

you risk inadvertently
informing the admiral.

PKE Which explains why
you have come here in secret.

The upside to being a fugitive.

How can we help?

ADM Control is located
within Section 31s

forward operating base.

We need to go there,
arrest Patar,

and reset the system
to take our input,

as it always has.

We rely on Control

for all of our critical
strategic decisions.

If it's in the hands

of extremists, the entire
Federation is in danger.

PKE Right, then...

...we should get moving.

TLY Admiral, Admiral, hello. Hi.

Lovely to see you, um...

I just wanted to tell you that
I'm-I'm not a fugitive.

I've never been
a fugitive before.

Except, well, when I was 16,

I went through kind
of a rebellious phase,

and I, uh, hacked into...

PKE Did you have something
to report, Ensign?

TLY Yes, sir. Uh... heh...

the subspace transmissions
that, that Tyler sent,

they went to 74 mark 5.6,

which is bizarre, because
there-there's nothing there.

Its just a bunch of empty
space and a penal colony

that was abandoned
over 100 years ago.

ADM It's not abandoned.
Thats Section 31 headquarters.

Where is Mr. Tyler,

by the way?
PKE Confined to quarters.

He can't do any further damage.

Start decrypting
those transmissions.

We need to know
what he sent them.

TLY - Aye, sir.
PKE- Lieutenant Detmer.

Set a course for
Section 31 headquarters.

DET Yes, Captain.

PKE Admiral, with your permission...

ADM The sooner we get there,
the better.

PKE Hit it.

HUS - Okay... do you want
to say it or should I? 
ARIM - You.

Okay... No, me! Uh, we eloped!

HUS Were married! To each other.

ARIM He is officially my...

HUS Albatross. Or ball and chain.

ARIM What have I done?
HUS What have you done?

ARIM We just couldnt wait anymore,
you know?

And well tell you all about it,
every sickeningly sweet detail.

HUS But first, we got to run.
Our shuttle boards in an hour.

ARIM We are so excited to come back

and celebrate with all of you
in person.

- (laughs) I'm gonna cry.
- (laughs)

We've been gone so long.
But were coming home.

ARIM Return to archive.

Begin memory review.

Delete.

Delete.

TLY Wait, wait,
what-what do you mean?

DET I mean, I'm not playing Ka-dis-kot
with you anymore.

TLY Why? You know why.

DET Its the same reason
I am not playing

with her anymore, either.

OWO Tilly, you've
memorized every possible gambit.

TLY No, I have not. Yes, I have.

OWO (laughs) But so has Airiam.

TLY True.

ARIM Save to archive.

(grunting)

(panting)

RHYS Dont hold back.

ARIM Save to archive.

Save to archive.

(door chimes)

Come in.

Delete.

PART TWO

TLLY You better be saving
every single Moment with me.

ARIM Actually,

those memories are
always the first to go.

TLY Oh. (giggles)

Kind of lucky you get to delete
everything you want to forget.

If I could do that, I probably
wouldn't recognize my mother.

ARIM You'd be less envious if you had

to go through
the process each week.

It can be tedious.

TLY Still.

Hey, is that... that new?

ARIM I used to keep it... private.

But I think I like
having it out now.

TLY Is this from the same beach?

ARIM Our last day together.

Our shuttle back home

went down, and...

Did you need me for something?

TLY Oh, yes. Um...

decryption help.

ARIM Mm.
TLY The sooner the better, if you can.

ARIM My memories
are not going anywhere.

I would be happy to help.

STA You're fine.

You're fine

You're fine.

Come on, which one of you
is missing from my spore drive?

You're fine.

You're fine.

Could one of you
say something, please?

I don't like to listen to myself
talk when I have an audience.

BRN We're thinking, Commander.

STA Think louder.

BRN We know of two occasions

on which a signal was followed

by the appearance
of the Red Angel:

our mission to the asteroid,
and to Kaminar.

But a signal appeared by itself

over Terralysium.
SPK And...

there was no signal when the
Angel appeared to me as a boy.

Or when it reappeared
to share its visions.

Perhaps there is
a significance in them

we have yet to understand.

Is the Angel using
these signals,

or the other way around?

BRN Your visions have
to contain something

to help us understand
what the Angel wants.

SPK I told you, I believe it wants
to warn us, nothing more.

Nen lhómek I sk ávdu tsífuzin.

"You are tending a
plant that is dead."

BRN I know what it means.

SPK Translation is not
the essence of understanding.

BRN Do you have
a better suggestion, Spock?

SPK My priority is to understand
why, of all sentient beings,

the Angel chose
to communicate with me.

BRN So you think it wants something
from you personally?

SPK It showed me
an apocalyptic future.

How I'm meant to prevent
that from occurring

is something I cannot
logically reconcile.

BRN The purpose of logic

is to problem-solve
in an uncertain environment.

Maybe we need

a little inspiration.

STA Could you find that
inspiration somewhere else?

It turns out your loud thinking
is distracting.

You're fine.

You're fine.

You're fine.

ARIM Now I understand why this
was so difficult for you.

The key encryptions
are continually changing.

TLY Good thing youre half robot.

ARIM I prefer "cybernetically
augmented," thank you very much.

DET Three cheers for cybernetics!

TLY I don't know, Detmer. I mean,

she hasn't actually
done anything yet, so...

Oh.

I stand corrected.

(whirring, clicking)

Think you're pretty smart, huh?

Airiam?

ARIM I'm sorry, I was focused.

This may take a while longer.

Why don't you return
to your station

in case the Captain needs
you for anything? 
TLY Sure.

DET Um, thank you for everything.

I'm dropping us out of
warp in ten minutes, sir.

PKE Pull up
defense schematics, please.

Admiral.

You want to tell us what kind of
shitstorm were flying into?

ADM Okay...

welcome to Section 31
headquarters.

Zoom in, please.
As you can see,
it is heavily fortified

on all sides.

OWO Are those mines?

- They are.
SAR The Federation

does not permit
the use of mines.

PKE No.

No, they do not.

ADM The Federation didn't build them.

I'd call that a distinction
without a difference.

ADM We were under attack
by Klingon warships

with cloaking abilities.

Sometimes in war,

the terrible choice is
the only choice.

PKE Giving up our values
in the name of security

is to lose the battle
in advance.

I'm curious, did you sideline

the Enterprise because you knew

I'd never stop
reminding you of that?

ADM You sat out the war...

because if we'd lost
to the Klingons,

we wanted the best
of Starfleet to survive.

And as this conversation
makes clear,

that was you...

and all you represent.

PKE Thank you.

ADM You're welcome.

Now, will you get off my ass

so we can get back to work?

SPK Unlike Ensign Tilly,

you seem to have no individual
expression whatsoever.

BRN It is quite an accomplishment
to be uniquely mundane.

Well, I express myself
through my work,

not my choice of decor.

SPK Clearly.

I am attempting to understand
why the Red Angel chose me

to expose a threat
to the entire galaxy...

and your solution is
to play chess?

BRN When the Red Angel showed you
visions you couldnt reconcile,

it caused you
to question your ability

to examine the world logically.

What better way
to return to logic

than via the game
that represents it?

SPK It is arrogant of you to assert

that my present manner
of thinking

requires fixing at all.

BRN It is arrogant of you
to assert it doesnt.

(exhales)

Or you're just afraid youll lose.

SPK All right, Michael...

let's play chess.

(low whirring)

(beeping)

(door whooshes open)

NAHN Commander Airiam.
ARIM Hello, Nhan.

NAHN May I help you?
ARIM Tilly was looking for you.

NAHN What are you doing?

ARIM Searching for data to
help with the decryption.

For all the benefits
of my augmentation,

its storage capacity
is not infinite.

Your species is Barzan, yes?

NAHN Yes.
ARIM Your augmentation

allows you to breathe
in our atmosphere?

NAHN And why are you asking?

ARIM Curiosity.

(brief whirring)

I should return to the bridge.

TLY Oh. I am so glad youre back.

Uh, whatever you did before,
its not working anymore.

ARIM I don't understand.
TLY Yeah, neither do I.

I mean, its like the system knew

we were trying to crack it,
and it changed its tactics.

But thats impossible, because
its automated, its not alive.

Right?

(sighs)

ARIM I'd like you

to stand beside me.

Do not move until weve
solved this problem.

Do you understand?

TLY No, that's okay, you've got this.
ARIM Please...

Tilly.

TLY Um... yeah, okay.

PKE Commander.

Dropping us out
of warp now, Captain.

Mr. Bryce... open a channel.

Tell Section 31 that Starfleets

- most wanted vessel is here.
OWO Captain,

sensors show all mines
are fully armed.

BRY No response
to our hails, Captain.

ADM They must be too busy
planning the welcome party.

PKE Are you sure you can get us
through these defenses?

ADM I wouldn't risk it otherwise.

Oh. My mission, your ship.

Lieutenant Detmer,

sending the route to you now.

Oh, one other thing
I should mention.

The shields
will have to be down.

PKE Why?

ADM The mines are attracted to them.

PKE Nothing's ever easy.

Lower shields
and take us closer.

(sighs)

BRN If there's a logical reason
to sacrifice your rook,

I fail to see it.

SPK Perhaps I simply dislike rooks.

BRN Perhaps... you're trying to lose.

SPK An odd supposition
given that I am

a willing participant
in the game.

BRN Sarek taught me
a more elegant strategy...

first day I played.

SPK There are other strategies
that our father,

in his single-mindedness,
chooses to ignore.

BRN I think our father
would be disappointed

in your lack of effort,
don't you?

SPK I disappoint him,

he disappoints me,

the sun sets, a new day begins.

BRN Oh, you're a philosopher now.

SPK And you're a human,

and you cannot presume
to know Sareks mind.

BRN The next logical move
would be for your knight

to take my pawn.

Seriously, what are you doing?

SPK Disrupting your expectations.

BRN I'm trying to help you, Spock.

SPK I do not need your help,
Michael.

BRN Our Captain says you do.

You are the only one

who has had contact
with the Red Angel.

You said you don't
understand why it chose you.

Thats where we need to start.

And logic

will

help.

SPK I understand now.
If only I'd taken your pawn,

the mystery would be solved.

BRN I refuse to take
this posturing seriously.

It's entirely out of character.

SPK We've not seen each other
in years.

You've no foundation
for judging my character.

Yet here you are,

full of self-importance...

once again taking responsibility

for that which is
beyond your control.

My perception of reality
was challenged by visions

from a time-traveling entity.

Who should help me
but you, of course.

After all, the entire
Klingon War was your doing.

No. Even your parents death

 was your responsibility.
BRN Stop it.

SPK If only you hadn't asked to
watch a star become supernova.

But you're wise
to blame yourself.

Children should know
when a warfaring race

will attack without warning.

Perhaps you could
have done something.

A child fighting a Klingon...
those are excellent odds.

BRN Shut up!

SPK You were trapped on the other
side of a door, Michael.

(objects clattering, thumping,
people screaming)

(indistinct shouting
in distance)

You could not stop any of it.

(sobbing)

You could not save them.

It is unreasonable for you
to believe otherwise, yet you do.

As you believed you could save
my family from logic extremists,

when in truth they
despised us because of me...

the half-human abomination.

Your presence
was beside the point.

BRN Whatever point you're trying
to make, youre failing.

SPK Then let me be clear.
You avoid reality

because it is easier for you
to shoulder burden

than to face unimaginable grief.

BRN I thought this could be
a new start for us.

I really did.

Clearly, I was wrong.

SPK Yes, you were.

We will never relate as equals

so long as you attempt to assume
every burden as yours alone.

BRN Since were being honest
with each other,

you need to stop taking
whatever this is out on me.

You need to identify
why youre really angry.

SPK There is nothing to identify.

I am angry, pure and simple.

BRN Because you feel like you failed
as a Vulcan or as a human?

SPK What I feel

is that failure is liberating.

And for the first time,
I enjoy expressing emotion.

(grunts)

PART THREE

(door whooshes open, shut)

PKE (over comm) Commander Burnham,

we need you on the bridge.

(chuckles)

BRN I'm on my way.

(door whooshes open)

(door whooshes shut)

PKE Yellow alert. Take us in.

(door whooshes open)

BRN Thats the most
defensive weapons I've ever seen in one place.
PKE Welcome to Section 31 headquarters.

No one from Control
will answer our hails.

Scans show no life signs,

but it is a former prison, so...

BRN So it would have been designed
to prevent such scans

- from working.
PKE Find a work-around.

I need to know
what were walking into.

BRN I'll do what I can, sir.
SAR Are you all right?

BRNI'm fine.

PKE Ensign Tilly,

have you decrypted
those messages yet?

TLY Moving as fast as we can, sir.

PKE Move faster.
RHYS Captain.

We have a problem incoming.

Blade Mines.

They'll slice the hull
like cheese.

SAR It appears that someone
is guiding them

directly toward us.

NAHN That shouldn't even be possible.

PKE Apparently it is.

Shields up. Red alert.

(alarm blaring)

This is your Captain.

Brace for a bumpy ride.

OWO Shields holding at 90%.

PKE Begin evasive maneuvers.

DET Pattern lambda ten.

Yes, sir.

ARIM You should go help now.

But you said not to leave.

I've got this. And they need you.

TLY Okay.

DET I can't shake these
Blade Mines, Captain.

Whoever's controlling them seem
to be anticipating our moves.

PKE Switch to pattern gamma four.

ADM Someone reprogrammed the mines.
I can't shut them off.

PKE Mr. Bryce,
contact Starfleet Command.

Tell them to order
Section 31 to stand down.

DET Sensors are saying
that were upside down.

ADM Those are blackout mines.
They interfere with navigation.

(grunts)

OWO Blackout mines?

DET The helm is not responding.
ADM It is, Lieutenant.

You're flying blind,
just like in the Academy.

OWO Shields down to 41%.

BRY No response from Starfleet, sir.

PKE Keep trying.
Lieutenant Detmer...

DET I'm trying my best, Captain.

PKE Not good enough.
This isn't a game.

BRN Wait. What if it is?

PKE Quickly.
BRN If the mines are reprogrammed,

they're being guided
by a computer.

And like a game,
after a few moves,

it anticipates what well do.

PKE Recommendations?

BRN We need to introduce
randomness and chaos, sir.

PKE Lieutenant Detmer,
trust your training.

You can do this.

PKE Mr. Saru, we need
an evasive pattern.

SAR Beta nine, Detmer.

PKE Admiral.

ADM Pi alpha two.

PKE Commander Burnham.

BRN Delta seven.

PKE Lieutenant Owosekun.

OWO Omega one.

(panting)

RHYS Theyre moving away from us,
Captain.

PKE Injuries?
OWO Five, sir.

All from the engine room.
No casualties.

PKE Damage report?
DET Warp and impulse engines

are inoperable, sir.

It's as if we were targeted.

ADM And now were sitting ducks.

BRY Sir, we're being hailed
by Section 31.

RHYS Its Admiral Patar.

PKE Cancel red alert.

(alarm stops blaring)

Put her through.

ADM What the hell are you doing,
attacking a Federation starship?

PAT My apologies, Admiral. Captain.

But

Discovery is presently
harboring wanted criminals

and is, itself,
a fugitive vessel.

It was deemed too dangerous

to allow you
in proximity to our base.

PKE We'll see what Starfleet has
to say. Lieutenant Bryce?

BRY I'm sorry, sir. They're-they're
still not responding.

PAT That is because
my order to attack

came directly
from Starfleet Command.

PKE If Starfleet ordered an attack,
they can damn well say it

to my face.
PAT Captain Pike,

please do not escalate
this situation further.

A Section 31 vessel is en route.
You will be boarded.

PKE For what reason?
PAT Starfleet regulations

are extremely specific
about the definition of treason.

Unfortunately, you, your crew

and the admiral all qualify.

ADM If you think youre coming
to arrest us, think again.

PAT Admiral, I do believe

- you went to
- Discovery with noble intentions.

However,
by abandoning your duties

to carry out a secret mission
with fugitives,

you became a fugitive yourself.

You no longer have the authority
to choose your own fate.

ADM I understand this is more
than you bargained for,

but you cannot abandon
the mission, Chris.

Whether I can
issue orders or not,

we have to get a team onto
that station and reset Control.

PKE What is it
about the look on my face

that suggests
I've changed my mind?

Lieutenant Rhys,

scan for any other weapons
on this base.

And call down to engineering.
We need that spore drive

up and running. Mr. Saru,

form a landing party
and meet us in my ready room.

SAR Uh, Captain, I believe I
can be more helpful here.

There is something I would
like to investigate.

PKE Get to it, then.

Commander Burnham, youre up.

STA Okay.

Come on.

Please don't shock me.

SPK You do realize inanimate
infrastructure cannot hear you.

STA Really? You're kidding.

Sorry, darling.

He just does not understand.

Ow!

Great.

Now there's a power short

on top of everything else.

SPK This makes my work impossible.

And I am not being
hyperbolic when I say

the future of the
galaxy is at stake.

STA Well, uh...

unless I can reroute power
to the adjacent conduit,

isolate the corruption,
fix it and the spore drive,

we're all gonna
get arrested, so...

if you want to save the galaxy,
start by helping me.

SPK A fair point.

STA I didn't know you knew
anything about electrical.

SPK I have many talents.

Point the light over here,
please.

STA So, did, uh...

Burnhams idea help?

Did you figure out why
the Red Angel chose you?

SPK No.

I have examined it
from countless angles,

yet I remain
an illogical choice.

STA Well, have you thought
about what makes you unique?

SPK I am half-human.

Unusual, but there are
others like me.

I can think of nothing else.

STA Well, if I were a Red Angel

traveling through time,

I'd plan my mind-melding
strategy pretty carefully.

Wouldn't just...

choose a random Vulcan.

Keep trying. Youll
figure it out.

Thank you.

Now, if only the spore
drive were that easy.

I think the corruption
might be with the navigator,

which, you know,
isn't important at all.

It just holds the map
to the entire mycelial network.

SPK You have traveled that
network hundreds of times.

Surely you know it well enough

to travel between two
points without assistance.

Perhaps you simply lack
faith in your own abilities.

STA I know you're angry with Burnham,

but she risked her life
to bring you here.

She loves you.

SPK If I may make an observation
of my own...

I saw

Dr. Culber moving out
of your shared quarters.

You seemed quite upset.

STA Yes, he said he needs distance.

SPK I submit that your assessment of
the situation may be inverted.

Perhaps he needs distance
from you

not because he no longer
has feelings for you,

but because he no longer knows
how to feel about himself.

BRN Power and life support
systems are disabled everywhere

except for the Data Center
where Control is located.

So well have to beam over
in EV suits.

PKE Because the politics
werent complicated enough.

NAHN Any idea how many
guards to expect?

AMD I havent been on the site
since before the war.

Your guess is as good as
mine. Probably better.

PKE Minimize the risks
as much as possible.

Lieutenant Detmer,

do your best to keep us in
range. Commander Airiam,

once they've secured
the Data Center,

you'll beam over and restore

Admiral Cornwells
access to Control.

ARIM Sir, I should go with them.

If the threat assessment
system has backup protections,

I can circumvent them before
we lose access entirely.

NAHN I'll look after her, Captain.

PKE Okay.

Good luck, everyone. Dismissed.

DET Look at you, going
off on a mission.

Don't forget about
us little people.

ARIM I will do my best, Kayla.
Mm-hmm.

BRN Captain, still no life signs,
and gravity is out.

PKE Please be careful.

Standing by to beam you out.

BRN That's frozen blood.

NAHN Well, that can't bode well.

BRN Burnham to Discovery.

Confirm visuals on EV suits.

PKE We see you all
in the corridor, Commander.

Proceed with caution.

BRN Yes, sir.

Commander Nhan,
can you find a way

to turn life support back on?

NAHN I'll be back in two seconds
if you need anything.

BRN Lets stay close.

Captain, I'm seeing clear signs
of a struggle.

There's more blood.

Looks like someone was trying
to pry these doors open,

or keep them from shutting.
PKE Any sense

of who was fighting whom?

BRN Not yet.

(gasps)

ARIM What do you think killed him?

BRN Thats a really good question.

NAHN Restoring power and gravity now,
Commander.

(sighs)

BRN Burnham to Discovery. At least four dead.

I'm guessing we'll find more.

But we've got gravity

and atmosphere restored.

(sighs)

ARIM Biometric data indicates

the victim died at
least two weeks ago.

BRN Bodies are frozen solid.

Captain, we have a problem.

It's Admiral Patar.

She's been dead two weeks.

PKE If she's dead,
who the hell was I talking to?

SAR Captain,

I believe
I can answer that question.

Look, as you know, all living
beings have a heat signature,

which changes
in high-stress situations.

When Admiral Patar's authority
was challenged,

I should have seen a change
in her signature,

but I did not.

As she was a hologram,
I now understand why.

Now... here is

the evidence against Mr. Spock.

In ultraviolet.

No changes despite
the violent attack.

This, too, is a hologram.

Which can only mean

Section 31 framed Mr. Spock.

Control was programmed

to create this evidence.

After killing the admirals,
it used the same skill

to create Admiral Patar.

We're fighting the system itself.

Which would explain

why Admiral Cornwell
was locked out.

PKE Control could also be
blocking our transmissions

to Starfleet Command.

Then why would it allow us
to send a team onto the station?

It must want something from us.

TLY Actually, I think it might
want something from Airiam.

She downloaded all of her

archived data,
all of her memories

onto Discovery.

None of it is
in her head anymore, and

those memories meant everything
to her.

PKE Find out what she downloaded
in their place.

Lieutenant Bryce,
open a secure channel

to Burnham and Nhan only.

Mr. Stamets, how are we
doing on that spore drive?

STA I'll be ready when you are, sir.

PKE Good, because we might need it
very soon.

(metallic thud)

(metallic creaking)

(thudding)

(thudding)

(sighs)

(sighs)

NHAN Looks like they were trying

to turn life support systems
back on again.

The door's closed on them
deliberately.

What could cause an entire
station to malfunction?

BRY Commander Burnham,
Commander Nhan,

you're on with the Captain.

PKE Commander,

what is Airiam doing?

BRN Trying to restore Admiral
Cornwells access to Control.

PKE No, she's not. Stop her... now!

NAHN What the hell was that?

(gasps for air)

(gasps) (gasps)

BRN Airiam, what are you doing?

PKE Commander Airiam, stand down.
That is an order.

Do you hear me?
(wheezing)

I said stand down!

Commander Airiam,
I need you to stop.

(groans loudly)

(wheezing)

(gasping)

(groans loudly)

(gasping)

(groans loudly)

(guttural gasping)

PKE Burnham?

(guttural groaning)

(guttural groaning)

(grunting)

(gasps)

(alarm beeping)

PART FOUR 

PKE Burnham, are you all right?

Michael?
BRN I'm fine.

I'm fine. What the hell is

happening to her?
PKE Airiam's compromised.

Somethings controlling her
through her augmentation.

TLY Sir, do you remember the Sphere?
It was... it was dying.

It had a lot of data.
PKE I was there. Get to the point.

TLY Okay, well, the messages
to Section 31...

they contained data
from the Sphere.

That's the data that Airiam
downloaded before leaving.

BRN What did she bring over here?

TLY All the information the Sphere

has ever collected
on artificial intelligence.

ADM Why would Control want AI data?

SAR A strategic advantage, perhaps.

That Sphere collected data from

countless civilizations over
hundreds of thousands of years.

PKE That much knowledge...

whatever the problem,
you could never outthink it.

It would always win.

BRN Oh, thats it.

It wants to think.

It wants to evolve.

That data's like a roadmap
for Control to become

fully conscious.

When it does...

PKE It can destroy all other
sentient life in the galaxy.

BRN Yes. That's what Spock saw
in his vision.

(thudding)

I'll delete
whatever she managed to upload.

Ugh! Damn it! I can't get in!

(grunting)

PKE Can you delete the data
remotely?

TLY I can't access the system,

and I definitely
can't hack Airiam.

(Burnham banging on door)

BRN She's trying to open the door
from the inside!

PKE We can't let her do that.
TLY I could... Maybe I...

PKE If you have any ideas.

TLY Open a channel to Airiam,

please?

PKE You're on.

TLY Thanks. Uh...

Airiam, hi. Its Tilly.

Uh, just a friendly reminder

that you saved every
memory you ever had with me.

I think that's because
you adored me.

And I adore you, too. (laughs)

I'm gonna send you something.

Whatever this thing
is making you do,

this is not who you are.

You are a...
a Starfleet officer.

You're an amazing colleague,
and you are a great friend.

And also, like, the best
Kadis-kot player Ive ever seen.

And I should know. I won
regionals when I was, like, ten.

Airiam,

this is not you. Please.

You know Michael.

She's your friend.

Airiam, I know you can hear me.

ARIM I can hear you, Tilly!

But I cannot stop myself.

Its overriding
my primary motor functions.

I was only able to transfer
25% of the AI data.

Control needs me to finish.

Michael,

you have to open the airlock.

Immediately.

BRN What?

No!

No, I'm not gonna
eject you into space!

ARIM I will unlock this door,

I will kill you,

finish my mission.

Then I will destroy

Discovery.

(door whooshes open)

And all on board will die.

Please, Michael.

The airlock.

BRN We can fight this, Airiam.

PKE Commander Burnham,
what are you doing?

BRN The system corrupted her.
If I can break in, and...

and take it offline,
shell be free.

PKE Michael, stop.

ARIM I disabled my helmet.

I will not survive in space.

PKE Commander Burnham.

Open the airlock.

BRN Captain, I don't want
to disobey your orders,

but if this works...

PKE Its her or you, Michael.

ARIM 15 seconds.

Please!

PKE Open the airlock, Michael.

BRN One more minute! Please!

TLY Hey, Airiam,

I'm gonna send you your favorite
memory, okay? Look at it.

ARIM I can't look at it now, Tilly.
Michael!

You have no other alternative
but to eject me!

PKE Burnham, that's an order.

(gasps)

ARIM I'm so sorry.

It wanted me to kill you.

Everything is because of you.

Because of me? (gasps)

SPK Michael,

open the airlock.

ARIM Please tell everyone
I love them.

(gasping)

You have to find
Project Daedalus.

BRN Where is Project Dae...

(Airlock whooshing)

(gasps)

(Ariam gasping for air)

(Burnham crying)

ARIM But we're coming home.

(whirring and trilling)

(trilling)
