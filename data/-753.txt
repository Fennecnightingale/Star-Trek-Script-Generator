PART ONE 

BRN Personal log,

Commander Michael Burnham,

stardate 865211.3.

Automatic transmission
to USS Discovery,

wherever or whenever
it might be.

I'm sending this message

because you need to know
what I've learned here.

I hope that, by some miracle,
you'll receive it someday.

700 years after we left,
dilithium supplies dried up.

The Federation tried
alternative warp drive designs,

but none proved reliable.

Then came The Burn.

No one knows how or why
it happened, but in an instan,

all dilithium went inert.

Any ship with an active
warp core detonated.

The Federation as we know it
disappeared overnight.

It's now just a shadow
of its former self.

We didn't give everything
for this version of the future,

and I'll be damned
if I let it stand.

I've become a courier.

I transport goods
in exchange for dilithium

to keep exploring,
sector by sector,

searching for clues
as to what caused The Burn,

answers that might help
to bring the Federation

together again.

Wherever I go,
I look for you, my friends.

I listen for any sign
of your arrival,

but communication
remains severely limited.

Even if I did find you,
I know it would be different,

because I am different.

But I will always love you,

but I've had to accept
I may never see you again.

You can love someone
and still let them go.

It feels like a dream,
this world.

A strange, terrible,
beautiful dream.

Combat simulation complete.

Luckily, I'm not alone
on this journey.

I found a friend in the truet
sense of the word.

This is my life now, and I..

SAR I cannot imagine
what this year has been for you.

I couldn't have
imagined it, either.

How is everyone?

Grateful for each other.

SAR They are finding ways to grasp

the enormity
of what we have done.

Some more successful
than others.

BRN And you?

How are you?

SAR Kelpiens have always had a deep
understanding of fear and loss.

Perhaps that prepared me
for this.

I do not like to think that
you were alone all this time.

BRN Well, the ship that pulled you

out of the ice
belongs to a friend.

He's a courier,
and we work together sometimes.

SAR You have been a courier?

BRN It was the only way
to scrounge up any information.

I sent a transmission
to Terralysium.

It took months
to get a response.

And they had never
heard of my mom.

I promised Book some dilithium
for getting me here.

SAR Book?
BRN Oh, Cleveland Booker.

My friend.

SAR Is he from Earth?

BRN No. But it's the name, right?

There has to be a story there.

I haven't gotten it
out of him yet.

SAR Well, we will honor
your arrangement, of course.

And I will offer Mr. Booker
my sincerest appreciation.

CREWMANN Welcome back, Commander.

BRN Nobody knows

if The Burn was an accident

or a natural disaster.

But it appears that devastation

flashed in an instant
across all known space.

STA That's impossible.

Nothing could affect
all dilithium all at once.

GRG Says a man who jumps a starship
through mushroom space.

DET How many?

How many died?

BRN Millions.

I wish I could tell you how much
of the Federation remains.

But I did find part
of a transmission

from an obsolete
Starfleet channel. 

Bryce?

BRY Aye.

SEN This is Admiral Senna Tal.

I will wait for any
who would join us on Earth,

anyone who still believes in us.

The Federation lives on.

But we need...

TLY Is he at Starfleet headquarters?

BRN Not sure.

That message was 12 years ago.

And Earth was always
too far away for me to reach.

But now with the spore drive,
we can get there.

We will find Admiral Tal

and help him begin the process.

BRN We should jump to outside
of Earth's scanning range.

Pose as a starship
that was stranded by The Burn,

trying to head home
at sublight speed.

GRG I see your little walkabout
has taught you a thing or two.

I like that.

SAR It is a wise strategy.

STA So, um, shall I go?

SAR Commander Burnham,

I believe we are due
for a conversation. Perhaps

we should...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There's no need.

SAR But we agreed to discuss...

BRN No, it-it's... it's you, Saru.

Uh...

And chain of command
dictates it.

I don't know
if it's ever been me.

You brought this ship
through time.

You carried this crew
on your shoulders.

You are a captain
in the truest sense of the word.

SAR It would be my honor.

This ship bears
the name Discovery.

Never has that been
more fitting or more prescient.

She has carried us
into the future,

and it will be our privilege

to make that future bright.

Let us begin. Together.

CREW Aye, Captain.

COMP Attention, all personnel.

Lockdown drills for Deck 7

have been canceled
until further notice.

BRN You okay?

TLY We haven't even had
a chance to say goodbye

to the friends we've lost.

Not to mention...

...my mom.

My cousins, my...
Everybody back home.

I mean, w-what,
they got breakfast,

they were late for work,

t-they had kids.

I mean, they had whole lives.

And they're gone.

No, they've been gone
for centuries.

I keep thinking there has got
to be something on Earth

that we'll recognize, right?

I don't know,
the Gateway Arch, maybe?

Uh...

The Giza pyramids?

Homemade hummingbird cake?

BRN Cake is eternal.

TLY Cake is eternal.

I always knew
that I would see you again.

Yeah, I keep having this, like,
image of you.

You're, like,
holding a dandelion,

and you blow on it,

and the seeds, they... go.

You let us go, didn't you?

It's okay.

Ah, time travel, man.

BRN Yeah.
TLY Ooh.

Look, I may not know you,

but, like, I know you.

Okay? So... whatever.

I love your hair.

BRN Thank you.

TLY You do seem, like... lighter.

Somehow.

BRN Hmm.

Ensign Tilly,

STAMETS VOICE I'm still waiting for
that recalibration kit.

PART TWO 

TLY Well, some things never change.

BRN Yeah.

Go. I have
to meet someone anyways.

TLY Okay.

GRG Welcome aboard.

BK You're not Detmer.

Or Tilly.

GRG I'd rather kill myself.

BK You're Philippa Georgiou.

Michael warned me about you.

GRG Did you listen?

BK Apparently not enough.

Is there a reason we're having
this conversation?

GRG I like to see
who's come aboard my ship

after gallivanting through space
with Michael.

BK "Gallivanting."

If only I'd known.

Where is she?

GRG Your girlfriend?

BK She's not my girlfriend.

No, really.

She's not... We didn't have...

Nope, nope.

We're not talking about this.

Answer my question.

GRG In another world,
I might have said

Michael is somewhere
being earnest

and doing the right thing.

In this one...

I'm not so sure.

BK My, oh, my.

Oh, my, oh, my.

If they could see
what I'm seeing.

GRG Who?
BK Who?
Any of them.
GRG Wow.

BK Come on, you could run a sector.

Two sectors.

A dozen, even.

BRN You brought me back.

Is it weird to say
I knew you would?

BK No.

'Cause you'd have done
the same thing.

Does it feel like home?

BRN It's familiar, but, um...

far away.

BK Do you feel like
you owe these folks something?

'Cause if you do, you know,
that's fine.

But remember...

you already jumped
through a wormhole.

Someone's eventually
going to find out

about this stash you have.

BRN Yeah.
Discovery will be a target.

You, too.

You pissed off
some scary people.

BK You helped.

Thank you.

Is there anyone here
we could piss off?

BRN You could come with us.
To Earth.

BK So we can piss off
an entire planet?

BRN Just the opposite.
You'd be safe.

No one will find you
out that far.

BK I believe in what I do, Michael.

I can't just give it up.

BRN There could be more Tranceworms
out there in need of your help.

BK Bollocks. I mean,

yeah, there might be, but...

BRN Clean slate.
BK Ah.

What do you get out of the deal?

BRN We could use your help masking
all that dilithium.

BK "We" as in Discovery.

What "we"
are you really talking about?

BRN Shush.

BK I learned by now

it's a lost cause trying
to say no to you.

I've never been to Earth.

BRN I've never been to this one.

Book's ship can cloak
our dilithium...

It's the safest choice.

SAR I cannot place
our entire dilithium supply

into the hands of a stranger.

BRN We don't have another option,
Captain.

SAR I must admit, Commander,

I am having some difficulty
trusting your judgment.

I am grateful for your support
of my captaincy.

But your refusal to even
consider the possibility...

surprised me.

This past year has altered
your perspective.

BRN I'm the same person, Saru.

And I'm not.

SAR As I am now responsible
for every life on this ship,

and as I had intended
to offer you

the position as my Number One...

I must insist you explain.

BRN Everything that
we dedicated our lives to

disappeared into madness.

We thought we could
imagine a future,

and it turns out we were wrong.

I adapted.

And I did what I had to
to learn as much as I could

about what happened and why.

I just need some time.

Book's ship can stay
in the shuttle bay

as long as it has our dilithium.

SAR It will remain under guard.

And he will not be permitted
to board it until we reach Earth

and the dilithium has been
safely removed.

Prepare to jump to Earth.

OWO Auxiliary power systems
and primary computer systems

are on line.

DET Impulse engines on line.

RHYS Weapons systems
fully operational.

BRY Communications on line.

TLY Warp core stable and functional
but powered down.

SAR Welcome to the bridge,
Mr. Booker.

And thank you for bringing
Commander Burnham home to us.

Commander Stamets,
status report?

STA Spore drive is on line,

and ready to go, Captain.

SAR Black alert, please.

BK Oh, shit.

Hey, you didn't tell me
about the spinning part. Huh?

BRN Coordinates relative to
galactic core confirmed.

Initiating multiphasic scans
and updating astrometric data.

DET Approaching visual range, sir.

OWO There she is.

SAR  Increase magnification, please.

Mr. Rhys, what are those arrays?

RHYS They seem to be some form of
advanced force field generators.

OWO Uh, sir, two vessels approaching
from Earth's orbit.

BRN They do not bear
Starfleet registries.

SAR Shields up, red alert.

BRY Sir, we're being hailed.

SAR Put them through.

NDY A viewscreen. How quaint.

I am Captain Ndoye of
the United Earth Defense Forc.

Your vessel has violated

regulations C1922 and F031
of the U.E. charter

by reaching Earth's perimeter.

Leave immediately.
You are not welcome here.

SAR I am Captain Saru
of the USS Discovery.

We are a Starfleet vessel

and unfamiliar with
the United Earth Defense Force.

Are you a branch
of the Federation?

NDY Your ship is not in our records.

SAR Discovery was on a long-term,

classified
scientific expedition.

We are the descendants
of its original crew.

NDY And you've continued to
function as a Starfleet vesse?

SAR We have.

We wish to contact
a Starfleet officer

whose message we received.

Earth was its point of origin.

NDY Your vessel's configuration
and metallurgy

suggest 23rd to 25th-century
construction.

I find it quite odd
that it remains in service.

SAR There is no need to replace
that which is not broken.

NDY How did your ship
survive The Burn?

SAR It was not at warp at the time.

NDY For us to consider your
request, your ship and crew

will undergo
a mandatory inspection.

Any evidence of piracy
will be dealt with severely.

SAR Piracy?

Very well, Captain Ndoye.

We will prepare
for your arrival.

We are beaming aboard now.

HUMAN Don't move.

STA Hey. What the hell is this?

Don't touch that!
Excuse me. Hey!

Who are you?

BRN Put these on.

BK Why?

BRN They're searching the ship.

If anyone is not
in full uniform,

they'll be suspect.
They could be arrested.

BK I see Earth's about as tolerant
as anyplace else.

What is this? Ah, whatever.

BRN You're "Lieutenant Booker" now.

BK Aye, aye, Commander.

BRN One "aye." We're not pirates.

BK Remember that time
when I had to wade

through that bog on Ikasu
to pull

those leeches off you?
BRN Yes.

When we saved each other.
BK Nope.

I saved you. And this

is worse than the bog.
BRN Oh...

SAR Attention, all Discovery
crew members.

We are undergoing inspection.

Your cooperation is expected.

BRN Thank you.

Okay. Go on.

Mm-hmm.

Just a uniform.

BK No, it isn't.

Oh.

You've been playing
the long game this whole time.

To get you to join Starfleet?

To see me in this outfit.

BRN Look, you will be
in your own clothes

and on your own ship

and petting your fat cat
in no time.

BK How many times have I told you?

BK She's a que...
BRN She's a queen.

BK Oh, you funny.

BRN I am.
BK Yeah.

BRN After you, Lieutenant Booker.

BK Aye, Commander Burnham.

I'll go blend in.

GRG Seriously? Admiral?

BRN I had to make it believable.

GRG You don't look so thrilled
to be back in uniform yourself.

I just forgot what it felt like.

Mm, once you've grown used
to living by your own rules,

it's not so easy to follow
other people's, is it?

BRN Why are you still
on Discovery, Philippa?

GRG Why are you?

I see it in your eyes, Michael.

You've tasted freedom that you
never even thought was possible.

Freedom from the obligations
of what others needed you to be.

I'm not sure you ever knew
who you really were

without someone else
to tell you.

But you're starting to.

And this place no longer
feels like your place.

Am I getting warm?

CON Commander Burnham
to the ready room.

SAR We believed Earth would be
a safe harbor,

a-a place
where we would feel welcome.

But we arrived
to find you suspicious

of a starship that hails
from your own planet?

May I ask what you are defending
yourselves from?

NDY Everyone lost someone
to The Burn.

We had to focus
on what we still had:

Our planet.

We rebuilt Earth
to be self-sustainable

all while being under
near-constant siege

by dilithium raiders.

The most recent wave is led
by a tenacious individual

named Wen.
He is relentless.

Targeting our ships.

He would take our dilithium
at any cost.

SAR I assure you we have no ties
with this Wen

or any other raiders.

Many of our crew consider Earth
their ancestral home.

BRN Yes. Captain,
all we want is to check in

with Starfleet Command.

NDY You have been away a long time.

I'm afraid you won't find
what you're looking for here.

The Federation and Starfleet
haven't been on Earth

for a hundred years.

SAR Where have they gone?

NDY No one knows.

Most of the ships destroyed
in The Burn were Federation.

No one knew if it was an attack

and, if so, whether
it would happen again.

Having Federation
headquarters on Earth

made it a potential target.

SAR I do not understand.

Earth is no longer
part of the Federation?

NDY Why should we be?
We can take care of ourselves.

BRN What about the Starfleet officer

who sent the transmission
I received?

That was just 12 years ago.

NDY What was the name?

BRN Admiral Senna Tal.

NDY Admiral Tal was on Earth.

But he died on an outbound ship
two years ago.

Its destination isn't listed.

I'm sorry.

STA Ah!

Hey! That's highly sensitive.

SEC Stand back.

TLY Is this how it's gonna be
everywhere we go? I thought

at least Earth would feel
like home.

You're not listening to me.
STA What are you doing?

Don't touch that.
ADI Why is that cube connected

to your vessel's
bridge controls?

STA This is a science
research vessel.

I'm an astromycologist.

I use the cube
for controlled spore reactions,

which requires coordination
with the bridge.

ADI This science vessel's
practically a museum.

TLY Okay, well,
museums are cool, so...

ADI That's what someone
who lives in a museum would say.

TLY I don't live in a museum.

STA How old are you? 17?
ADI 16.

STA Would you please remove
your 16-year-old fingers

from my life's work?

What did I just say?

ADI This is an interface
of some kind.

TLY Okay, we get it. You're smart.

Everybody here is smart!

SEC Adira.

Our job is to inspect,
not engage.

We're done here.

PART THREE

SAR Report.

OWO Five unidentified vessels
incoming.

RHYS They're powering up
advanced phasers of some kind.

Those are Wen's ships.

His raiders are always
scanning for targets.

BRY They're hailing us, sir.

NDY Do not respond.

SAR Dialogue
is an effective strategy.

NDY We know our enemy.
Do not respond.

SAR You have no jurisdiction
on my bridge.

Put them through, Mr. Bryce.

WEN Federation vessel.

Surrender your dilithium
immediately.

Scan us.
We have no dilithium on board.

WEN The speed with which
you appeared in sensor range

tells me something else.

Surrender, or we will take
what we need by force.

NDY Your request to visit Earth
is denied.

Leave orbit immediately.
We'll deal with Wen ourselves.

Inspectors,
this is Captain Ndoye.

Cease all activities and return.

CREWMAN Sir, we can't.

Something is interfering
with our transport.

NDY What?

This is sabotage.

SAR We are a Starfleet vessel

and would never utilize sabotage

against the Federation's
home planet.

We will find the cause
of the transporter interference

and handle Wen.

His fight is with us, not you.

NDY Then take that fight away
from our orbit,

or we'll shoot them
out of the sky,

and you will have started a war
in the name of Starfleet.

BK Tell me you saved the day.

BRN I have a plan.

BK Yes.

BRN Remember Donatu Seven?

BK- No.
BRN - You do so.

BK Yes. Okay.

But I'm trying to forget.

BRN Well, we need to get
to your ship.

Unless you want to keep
brooding into your synthehol...

BK - Synthehol?
BRN - Mmm.

BK Damn. And here I am,
trying to get a buzz on

and reach a place
of existential despair.

BRN - You coming?
BK - Yes. I'm worried about my cat.

Don't you have to ask
for permission?

BRN - I'll apologize after.
BK - Okay. Donatu Seven.

I'm sober.
Maybe it'll work this time.

TLY You're right.

That's not our tech.

Okay, it's accessing

our deflector shield systems.

STA Which is allowing it to block
the beaming frequencies

of the inspectors'
personal transporters.

TLY And there's a fail-safe,
so if we try to disable it,

our shield systems
will shut down, too.

It's gonna take hours
to find a workaround.

STA I knew that tween menace
was up to something.

And she did this
while we were yelling at her.

TLY She's not even a tween menace.
She's a friggin' teen genius.

I mean, I was
an engineering whiz

when I was her age, trust me,

but this would require
knowledge of the inner workings

of a 900-year-old starship.

STA And she identified
that our bridge controls

are connected to the spore cube
with barely a glance.

TLY I think she was watching
the others to make sure

that they weren't watching her.

STA She must have been
working alone.

TLY But what's the point
in sabotaging our ship?

She's just trapping
her own people on board.

STA Maybe... she was buying herself
some time?

TLY How do you get a teen genius
to fess up?

Give her some
of your weird mushrooms.

STA Who are you?

BRY I'm sorry, sir.
The raider vessels

aren't responding to our hails.

OWO I'm detecting an unauthorized
departure from the shuttle bay.

It's Booker's ship.

It's no longer cloaked.

There are two humanoid
life signs on board and...

SAR Go ahead, Lieutenant.

OWO They have our dilithium.

NDY Dilithium?

The future looks darker
and darker for you.

SAR Captain Ndoye,
I said I would handle Wen,

and I intend to do so.

Burnham is on that ship,
with Booker.

Lieutenant Detmer.
Where are they headed?

DET Straight towards
the raiders, sir.

SAR Hail Commander Burnham.

GRG No. If she responds
to your hails,

the raiders will think
that she's working for you,

and that would
ruin her advantage.

SAR Advantage for what, exactly?

GRG My guess is she's thinking
like one of them,

taking what she needs,
and doing what's necessary.

SAR She did not consult me.

GRG Have you heard the one
about the unstoppable force

that met an immovable object?

You are the object.

NDY This is Ndoye. Target the vessel
approaching the raider ships.

SAR I will not permit that.

NDY Under no circumstances
can Wen obtain

your dilithium.

BK Okay, these ships
have seen better days.

Not the raiders we're used to.

BRN Yeah.

BK Hey.

Let's try Orion Tango.

Yeah? Come on,
Orion Tango's fun.

Remember that time with the creature...
BRN Feathers.

BK I thought it was scales.

BRN Whatever they were,
I was digging them

out of my hair for days.

BRN - We could do Radok Sien.
BK - Absolutely not.

How many times you want me
to get my nose broken?

My whole face swelled up,

and Grudge wouldn't look at me
for days.

I was crushed.

BRN He's hailing us.

WEN Talk fast.

BRN We have what you need. We want
to make a deal. Scan our ship.

BK That was entirely monosyllabic.

I love it when you do that.
BRN You're weird.

Just did it again.

WEN Dilithium?

You stole it from Discovery.

BRN What do you care?
We have a lot of it.

We'll beam it over,

but you have to leave
Earth's orbit now.

WEN What's in this for you?

BRN We're peace-loving individuals.
WEN No one

simply gives away
that much dilithium.

BK Earth's got quantum torpedoes
aimed right at us.

WEN Earth hangs everyone out to dry.

BK I need to find out what
they're doing. Getting us

out of the firing range.
BRN No, not yet.

Discovery will come through.

BK Saru doesn't even know
what we're up to.

BRN He'll figure it out.
BK Yeah.

And when he does, why is
he gonna come and rescue us?

BRN Because he's Starfleet.

NDY Fire torpedoes in 30 seconds.

This is your last chance,
Captain.

SAR My people are on that ship.

NDY Your people
who disobeyed a direct order.

They stand down or they die.

My duty is to United Earth.

GRG She's left you only one way

to protect Michael
and the dilithium.

SAR We will not attack Earth.

Starfleet does not fire first.

RHYS 15 seconds, Captain.

GRG You are a slow learner, Saru.

SAR And you are far too fast
on the trigger.

Lieutenant Detmer, when Earth

opens fire,
we will take the hit.

DET - Sir?
SAR - Move us into position, Lieutenant.

DET Wait. We just recovered.
We don't know what

their torpedoes could do to...
OWO Shields are at full capacity.

SAR Commander Burnham

has never let us down before.
She will not do so this time.

RHYS Five seconds. Four. Three.
SAR Lieutenant Detmer, now!

OWO Sir, we've lost shields.

SAR Divert all nonessential power.

Get them restored
as quickly as possible.

RHYS Raiders are charging
their phasers

and getting ready to fire back.

NDY United Earth has a standing
order to take them down.

GRG If they have to go through you
to stop Wen, they will.

Time to fight or die, Captain.

BRN Discovery can't take
another hit.

That means the next shot
from Earth will end you.

So you can either
lower your shields

and let us beam the dilithium
over and stay alive...

BK Or fire back. Hope for the best.

Either way,
I'll sleep just fine.

WEN Prepare to transport
the dilithium.

BRN When he lowers his shields,

we're going to have to move fast.
BK Mm-hmm.

RHYS Earth is preparing to fire
again. 
SAR Come around again,
Lieutenant.
DET Captain,

we have no shields to defend.

SAR I have given my order.

RHYS Booker's ship
just cloaked itself.

Captain, raiders
are powering down weapons.

NDY Wen has never
backed away before.

GRG Perhaps they met
an unstoppable force.

SAR Tell your people to stand down.

NDY Not until I'm certain that...

BRN Special delivery.

The dilithium is safe.

His people won't fire

on us as long as we have
their captain.

It's time for you two to talk.

NDY There is no talking
past the damage

he and his like have done.

WEN Damage we've done?

Do you have any idea how much

we've lost?
SAR When was the last time

your two peoples talked
with one another?

NDY They have no respect.
WEN They have never listened.

SAR Try.

WEN United Earth doesn't even
utilize their dilithium.

They just hoard it
while the rest of us suffer.

NDY You bring your suffering
on yourselves.

BRN Maybe you should talk
to one another

face-to-face.

WEN If you don't surrender
your dilithium,

my people
can still take it by force.

My life is not that important.

GRG Diplomacy is so slow.

NDY You're human?

SAR Perhaps it is time to stop
making assumptions...

and start listening.

PART FOUR

STA I know what you did.

What were you doing?

ADI The technology on this ship...

Your glass cube,
these spore canisters...

There's more to it
than you're letting on.

So explain it to me
or I'll report you.

STA If you were going to report us,

you'd have done it
a long time ago.

Besides, I don't think you want
everyone knowing you're the one

responsible for the sabotage.

Am I wrong?

Now, you want to show me
what you're working on?

These spores are
from the fungal species

called
Prototaxites stellaviatori.

They power an alternate form of
faster-than-light travel

called the displacement-
activated spore hub drive,

though no one actually
calls it that.

And, uh,
that interface you saw...

...it connects to me.

I'm its human navigator.

ADI Are there others like you?

STA There's no one like me.

ADI Well, I know how that feels.

Um, so, your ship wasn't
stranded after The Burn.

Are you even a part
of Starfleet?

STA Yes.

But, um, from the year 2258.

ADI That explains a lot.

I mean, all the old technology
that still looks brand-new.

But... how?

If you want any more details,

STA then I need to know
who I'm talking to.

Because there's also more to you
than you're letting on.

ADI I became an inspector hoping
I'd come across

a Federation starship.

The sabotage was just so
I could have more time, here.

I just needed to make sure
I could trust you.

Because I want to come with you.

STA Come with us? Why?

ADI Senna Tal,

the Starfleet officer
you've been looking for...

I know him.

BRN When we first scanned your ship,
it was overcrowded.

Strained beyond its means.

Not a typical raider ship.

WEN Our habitats on Titan are...

barely livable.

NDY Titan?

That was once
a research colony.

You split off from Earth
a century ago,

you're fully self-sufficient.

WEN We were.

An accident at our liquid-
hydrocarbon research base

destroyed a third
of our habitats.

Wiped out our tillable soil.

We've no long-range
communications,

no way to ask for help.

And we have lost...

too many to count.

The first ship we sent for help,
to our home planet,

was fired upon and destroyed.

Then we knew we were on our own.

NDY Earth has had to have strong
defense protocols

in the name of
self-preservation.

We didn't know.

WEN Now you do.

BRN Captain Ndoye,

can Earth provide engineers
and equipment to Titan,

so an accident like that
doesn't happen again?

SAR And assuming.

Titan's research was not lost,

perhaps it could be shared
with Earth in return.

NDY I'm willing to discuss terms.

WEN As am I.

NDY The way you handled Wen
was admirable.

An exception can be made
for your crew

to visit Earth's surface,
should they wish to do so.

SAR They would appreciate that
immensely.

It has been a long journey.

You spoke with Adira.

NDY She told me she can help you.

She has my permission to remain
on board your ship.

SAR Thank you, Captain Ndoye.

I would like to believe
we will return someday.

NDY We hope to offer you
a warmer welcome when you do.

May your search be fruitful,
Captain Saru.

SAR Commander Stamets said you know
where to find Admiral Tal.

Does this mean
he is alive after all?

ADI Um, sort of.

I am Admiral Tal.

SAR Although human,

it appears young Adira has been
joined with a Trill symbiont.

BRN Trill?

I've seen Trills
at the exchanges.

I didn't know
they carried symbionts.

SAR Hmm. According to
the sphere data,

the symbionts are
a sentient life-form,

benevolent
and extremely long-lived.

Once they join with a host,
that host has the ability to

access the memories
of all former hosts.

BRN Including Admiral Tal's.

SAR Yes, but...

it seems Adira has difficulty
accessing those memories.

Perhaps because she is human
and not Trill.

Well, regardless,

she may carry knowledge of
what remains of Starfleet.

BRN I hope so.

I should've told you
about my plan.

SAR Yes, you should have.

BRN Trust must remain an assumption
between us.

We have work to do,

and I would be proud
to do it by your side.

But there are things,
in my year here...

...that I let go of.

And I need time

to find my way back to them.

If I can.

SAR I will trust you to grow
through change,

as you have trusted me.

BRN Then it would be my privilege
to be your Number One.

If things were easy...

BK They wouldn't be worth it.

BRN Huh?

Are you sure you won't
miss the uniform?

BK I have a rash from
that damn uniform, okay?

You owe me.

BRN You get a fresh start
in a new quadrant...

By my count we're even.

BK I'm glad you have
a family here, Michael.

BRN Till next time.
BK Till next time.

BRN That's Starfleet Academy.

SAR Indeed.

Well, at least, it was.

BRN Where is everyone?

SAR I gave them leave
to pay a visit.

You're welcome to join them.

BRN No.

I think
I'll admire the view from here.

With you.

TLY Some places
can survive anything.

After all this time.

Oh, my God.

Here it is.

I used to study under this tree.

DET So did I.

RHYS Me, too.

It's so...

big now.

TLY It's so weird.

It's like...

all these things are gone,
but here it is.

It's exactly where
it's supposed to be.

RHYS We all stood in the same spot,

930 years apart.

Who else can say that?

SAR This is Captain Saru.

TLY Oh, please, Captain,

can we just have
five more minutes?

SAR We have much work to do
before we continue

our search for Federation
headquarters, but...

you may have your five minutes.

Enjoy.

THE END
