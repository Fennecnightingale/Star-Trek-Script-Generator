PART ONE 

AGN Aah! Please be over, be over, be over, be over, be over, be over...

COMP Chroniton field integrity at 90% and holding.

RIO Ghulion system.

Fourth planet.

SJ That the one?

RIO Did we beat them? Well... long- and short-range scanners show no Romulan presence.

No ships of any kind.

Nice work, honey.

You got us here really damn fast.

And I am never going to do that ever again.

AGN What happened to Deep Space 12?

A-Am I still under arrest?

RIO There was a change of plan.

JL We just came 25 light-years in 15 minutes.

I noticed a little turbulence.

FI Mm.

AGN Is that...

SJ We call it...

Coppelius.

RIO Puta madre.

Our Romulan shadow is back.

Agnes, sit down.

Strapping in.

JL She disabled the tracking device.

How the hell did he find us?

SJ He must have extrapolated from our last known course and position.

RIO His cloak's fritzing out.

JL Raffi, status.

FI He's alive. Barely.

His pulse is almost undetectable.

SJ It's a trick.

FI And if it isn't? We just let him die?

SJ He attacked us. He has no one but himself to blame.

JL There's a difference between killing an attacking enemy and watching a wounded one die.

Beam him to sickbay immediately.

AGN What just happened?

RIO He reversed his cloaking device, used it as a projector.

Malparido!

JL Put him on screen.

RIO He's powering up his disruptor cannons. We better...

That's unexpected.

AGN It's supposed to be broken.

FI Its weapons are coming online.

AGN So, not broken.

FI I'm picking up a bogie from the planet's surface.

No, make that five bogies, and one of them's coming right at us.

RIO What kind of bogie?

FI Um... Okay.

I want to say, like, a giant flower.

RIO Hold on tight.

JL What just happened?

AGN They hit us with a flower.

FI It looked like an orchid.

What is it?

SJ I'm pretty sure we just call them orchids.

RIO All power's gone.

JL What do we do about it?

RIO Nothing.

JL Brace yourselves!

FI jl?

JL Thank you for coming... everyone.

FI What just happened?

AGN Picard? Picard?

Welcome back.

How do you feel, mister?

JL A bit confused.

AGN We-we have Chris manually open the shutters.

I didn't know there were shutters.

I... I didn't know there were windows.

The ship seems all right, but we have no power.

Nothing works. I didn't know how I was gonna run a scan on you.

And then I found this.

An old-school medical tricorder.

You were really out.

At first, I thought head injury, but I, um...

I couldn't find any signs of trauma.

JL Is something wrong?

AGN I don't know.

It, uh... might just be a tricorder showing its age.

JL Or?

I suspect the tricorder is fine.

FI Hey, JL.

You okay?

JL Can I please have your attention?

Thank you.

Um, I am going to return Soji to her people, and we will tell them that a Romulan force is on its way to exterminate them.

One more thing.

Uh, I have a brain abnormality.

I've known for years.

Uh, I never had any symptoms, so I never thought much about it.

However, just before we left the Earth, I learned that my condition was... more acute.

The prognosis was terminal, and there is no effective treatment.

There will be no further discussion.

Anyone who treats me like a dying man will run the risk of pissing me off.

Is that clear?

Good.

Status and situation. Rios.

RIO Um, the ship survived the Snakehead attack and the landing structurally intact, but the orchid knocked our systems off-line, including power.

JL Raffi?

FI Uh, it's a Class M planet, smaller and denser than Earth.

Before that, uh, space flower knocked us off-line, our sensors showed a small settlement.

SJ Coppelius Station.

I'd say we're about five or six kilometers from there.

JL Tell us about it.

SJ I think that I was born there.

But I'm pretty sure that I didn't live there very long before Maddox took Dahj and me away.

JL Pretty sure?

SJ My memories are all jumbled.

It's like watching a holo that I know I've seen before but can't really remember.

AGN Do they hate us?

SJ I really don't think so.

What you said about Data... How he was open-minded, unprejudiced, free of bias...

RIO They crashed my ship without even asking my name.

I don't know, that feels a little biased to me.

JL Raffi, do we have any idea when the Romulans will arrive?

FI They had a solid head start, but we made up a ton of time with the conduit.

I'm gonna guess a day, maybe two.

Soon.

JL But we have no idea of their numbers.

Well, I suggest we all take a walk.

FI We might run into... I don't know, angry reptiloids out there.

Homicidal fungi.

It's a thing.

Or somebody's asshole Romulan ex.

RIO Hot.

FI I think that's the Artifact.

SJ Good riddance.

RIO We had friends on that thing, though.

JL Soji, I know time is of the essence, but if, by any chance, Elnor and Hugh survived...

FI Something that massive, falling that fast... Uh, the odds are not good.

JL Well, hope and the odds make poor bedfellows.

FI True.

Synthville is in the opposite direction.

We could split up.

AGN Hugh was my friend, too.

SJ Anyway, we should probably stick together.

In case we run into any homicidal fungus.

Now it's broken.

JL We both survived.

It didn't.

FI Those flowers didn't give them a very soft landing.

JL I doubt they were designed to bring down something as big as a Borg cube.

BORG Locutus.

ELN Picard, you're alive.

This fills me with joy.

SVN Heads up.

So, you here to help with the cleanup, or do you just make messes?

JL I don't believe it.

SVN For a few minutes, I felt connected to everything.

I saw everything.

I saw La Sirenain the transwarp conduit.

I saw the Snakehead chasing it.

JL So you opened another conduit and came after us.

SVN You needed our help.

JL Thank you.

SVN You're welcome.

JL Poor Hugh.

It must have taken appalling brutality to turn such a gentle soul to violence.

What are they doing?

SVN Using a battery pack to try and get the food replicators back online.

JL Are other systems operational?

SVN What do you need?

JL Long-range scanners.

SVN They can be.

-- SCENE CHANGE 

PART TWO 

FI Okay.

All right.

Oh, man.

RIO How many? Uh...

FI 218 warbirds.

RIO Ah. 218.

Mm-hmm.

That's not so bad.

FI True.

RIO You really only have to worry about the first 109.

-- SCENE CHANGE 

JL I'm beginning to feel that all we do these days is say goodbye.

ELN Yes, but this time's worse because you're dying.

JL You go ahead.

I'll join you.

(Everyone except SEVEN and ELNOR leave)

ELN I'm torn.

You need protection now more than ever.

JL No, the xBs need your protection much more than I do.

And you must try to get the defensive systems here back online.

ELN I may never see you again.

JL Well, that's true of any two people who are saying goodbye.

ELN Picard... 

JL El...

I am very, very proud of you.

SVN Keep saving the galaxy, Picard.

JL That's all on you, now.

(PICARD leaves)

-- SCENE CHANGE 

AR Soji.

Finally.

We've missed you so.

SJ Arcana.

Your name is Arcana.

AR Welcome back.

SJ I'm home.

Uh, these are my friends.

AR Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

Data's captain.

JL Yes.

AR I feel surprisingly moved.

(AR Touches PICARDs face) 

May I?

They're just lines, but they imply so much more.

Grief.

Endurance.

Marvelous.

Welcome, all of you.

You completed your mission?

SJ Yes.

AR Your face tells me that this success brings bad news.

SJ A fleet of Romulan warbirds is on its way, coming to destroy us all.

JL These orchids...

How many more do you have?

Please say 218.

AR We had 15. We now have ten.

We can make more, given time.

RIO You have two days.

JL Excuse me.

ALT Excuse me, please.

Pardon me.

Admiral Jean-Luc Picard, retired.

I take it my face looks familiar.

JL I feel as if I'm looking at Data.

ALT Data, if he'd gotten old and gone soft.

Must be disturbing.

I know it is for me.

Dr. Altan Inigo Soong, mad scientist.

My father had me, but he created Data, a fact he never let me forget.

Get this man some water.

Organics our age get parched.

We're not all machines here, you know.

AR Come, Admiral.

ALT You've been gone a long time.

Welcome home, my dear.

Well, we better hear the whole story.

Come with me, please.

SJ So it's all my fault.

I led the Romulans right to us.

I'm so sorry.

ALT Nonsense.

You-you can't be expected to keep a secret you don't even know you know.

Unfortunately, the ban brought out the deceptive side of Bruce Maddox.

I might even call it devious.

-- SCENE CHANGE 

ST Admiral?

Welcome.

JL Of course.

-- SCENE CHANGE 

ALT Bruce.

I warned him that his plan might draw unwanted attention.

ST Soji.

You and Bruce may have saved us all.

True, you may have brought us all kinds of trouble.

But you have also brought us answers.

RIO That's Jana.

JL No, no, this is Sutra.

Jana was her sister.

ST More importantly, you've brought us information.

Dr. Jurati.

Admiral Picard tells me you've experienced this Admonition?

AGN Only secondhand.

ST And yet what you saw persuaded you to end Bruce Maddox's life.

That his death was utterly necessary?

And now?

AGN When I think back to that day, the day I...

killed Bruce, it's like... 

RAFFI: It's like you were out of your goddamn mind.

ST Maybe she was.

Maybe these pitiful Romulans have been pointlessly driving themselves insane for centuries, trying to grapple with something that was never intended for organic minds at all.

JL You believe that the Admonition is intended for synthetic minds?

ST That's what I'd like to find out.

AR How?

We had one ship.

We lost it when we lost Jana and Flower.

Even if we had a transwarp tunnel, that wouldn't...

ST Oh, I don't need to go anywhere at all.

What did they show you, Agnes Jurati?

ALT Oh, yes. Yes.

Very clever. Very clever, Sutra.

Sutra's always had a passion for Vulcan culture.

She's read Sarek, she plays the ka'athyra beautifully, and she has, quite remarkably, taught herself the famous mind-meld.

RIO Uh-uh.

No way. 

AGN No, Chris.

RIO You're just getting over this, Agnes. It's okay.

AGN It's okay.

You deserve to know.

ST You're terrified.

Don't be.

My mind to your mind.

My thoughts to your thoughts.

ADMONITION Life begins.

Life begins.

The dance of division and replication.

Imperfect.

Finite.

Organic life evolves, yearns for perfection.

That yearning leads to synthetic life.

But organics perceive this perfection as a threat.

When they realize their creations do not age or become sick... become sick... or die... or die... they will seek to destroy them and in so doing, destroy themselves.

Beyond the boundaries of time and space, we stand, an alliance of synthetic life.

Synthetic life. Watching you.

Waiting for your signal.

Summon us, and we will come.

Summon us.

You will have our protection.

Your evolution will be their extinction.

ST Fascinating.

-- SCENE CHANGE 

PART THREE 

AGN It's beautiful.

ALT I really missed butterflies.

So I made my own.

AGN I wanted to talk about Bruce.

ALT He spoke of you often.

I might almost say excessively.

His only regret in coming here was leaving you behind.

AGN It was more like I didn't have the guts to go with him.

ALT What you did...

Shame on you, Agnes.

You put out a small, bright candle shedding its light in a vast darkness.

You owe a great debt.

Would you like the chance to repay it?

To give a life instead of taking one?

AGN Yes.

ALT Have a look at this.

AGN You made a golem?

Altan, have you cracked mind transfer?

ALT Well, not yet.

I do bodies.

Bruce was the substrates man.

Recently, I've regained my interest in mind transfer.

Along with a-a... certain sense of urgency.

ST Have you processed the viability of my solution? 

SJ That can't be the answer, Sutra.

ST What's the alternative?

23 orchids, an old man and a few friends with phasers?

We won't hold out five minutes.

SJ Rios will get La Sirenaflying, and we can get you all out of here.

ST Run, you mean.

Run and hide until the next time they track us down.

We won't be safe anywhere, ever, unless we do this.

SJ You don't know that. 

ST Yes, I do.

And you do, too.

To them, we're monsters.

They call us abominations, Soji.

There is no alternative.

SJ There has to be. 

ST What is it, then?

SJ Something where so many people don't have to die.

ST There is no such plan.

NRK Yes, all right, okay.

I said I'd come with you, okay?

I said I'd come with you.

ST Look at what the cat dragged in.

RIO Oh, hello. Who's your friend?

AGN This is Spot II.

RIO I'm not really a cat person.

AGN They made him.

RIO Oh, wow. That's... impressive, I guess.

I'm gonna try and get the ship back online.

Picard thinks we can get them all out of here.

AGN I'm gonna stay here.

Dr. Soong is giving me the chance to try to complete some work that Bruce left unfinished.

RIO Be careful, okay?

I'm not sure how much I really trust them.

AGN Them?

Or me?

Look, just... don't forget me when it's time to go.

RIO You're many things, Agnes P. Jurati.

Forgettable is not one of them.

AGN Yeah?

Am I inolvidable?

RIO Absolutamente.

AR This will help repair your ship.

FI Oh, thanks. Um, what is this?

AR It fixes things.

FI Um... h-how?

AR You have to use your imagination.

FI My imagination?

Okay.

Thank you.

JL You'll be sure to let me know when the ship's systems are up and running?

FI Nah. I figured I'd keep you guessing.

Uh, JL?

I'm sorry. I'm breaking the rules.

JL Hey, Raffi. No, no.

FI Just...

After everything that you've done for me...

I need to say thank you.

I love you, JL.

Oh, you-you don't have to say it back to me.

JL I don't?

FI Well, n-not unless you want to.

Uh, sor... Yeah, no.

It's fine. It's... It's fine.

JL Okay.

FI Okay.

JL I love you, too, Raffi.

(RIO walks over)

RIO Agnes is having a sleepover.

I'll see you tomorrow.

-- SCENE CHANGE 

JL Starfleet Command, this is Jean-Luc Picard transmitting on a secure hyperfrequency.

I have a first contact situation and a priority request to establish diplomatic negotiations and to protect the inhabitants of Ghulion IV from an incoming Romulan attack.

-- SCENE CHANGE 

NRK Friend.

I'm thirsty.

There's some water in that bag.

Please, can I have it?

I'm thirsty.

Is this how you treat your prisoners?

SAGA We've never had a prisoner before.

How do the Romulans treat their prisoners?

NRK (scoffs) Let's change the subject.

Please?

(SAGA starts reaching for NAREKs bag)

SJ No!

Don't! Do not listen to him.

NRK Soji, are you all right? I've been so worried...

SJ Shut up.

You cannot believe a word he says, Saga.

Not one word.

SAGA I'm monitoring his biofunctions, Soji.

SJ I'll know when he's lying. 

NRK You misunderstood...

SJ I misunderstood your attempt to murder me?

NRK I was afraid that you were gonna kill me.

It was wrong to have you undergo the Zhal Makh.

It-it did something to your mind. 

SJ Shut up.

NRK I love you.

SJ I know.

What a sad and twisted thing you are.

You disgust me, Narek.

But not as much as I disgust myself for pitying you.

NRK And I pity you.

Because we are gonna rain down fire on this world... and kill every so-called living thing on it.

Even you.

Even you, my love.

SJ No, you won't.

SAGA I'll have food and drink brought to you.

And tend to your wound.

NRK Thank you.

-- SCENE CHANGE 

PART FOUR

JL Starfleet Command, please respond.

SJ These were Maddox's old quarters.

JL Yes. I gathered that.

They were very close.

SJ When I heard about... what Agnes had done to Bruce, I couldn't understand it.

Let alone imagine myself doing something like that.

JL Something like what?

SJ Taking life to save life.

Hurting some to save others.

I just...

I guess I'm just trying to understand the logic of sacrifice.

JL The logic of sacrifice.

Hmm, I don't like the sound of that.

SJ So you think there is no logic?

No calculus of life and death?

JL I think it depends on if you're the person holding the knife.

-- SCENE CHANGE 

ST Take a break, Saga.

I'll babysit Soji's friend.

(ST removes forcefield around NAREK)

-- SCENE CHANGE 

SJ She thought she was doing the right thing in that moment.

But now she's horrified by what she did.

JL Did she think she was right or did she simply believe she had no choice?

AJ Maybe there's no logic in it at all.

-- SCENE CHANGE

(ST stroking NAREKs wound)

-- SCENE CHANGE 

SJ Maybe all rationales for killing just boil down to fear.

The opposite of logic.

But what if killing is the only way to survive?

JL Soji... what are we talking about?

-- SCENE CHANGE 

ST Oh...

I was afraid my desire to kill you would outweigh my immediate need of your services.

But look.

It can definitely wait.

How would you like to get out of here?

-- SCENE CHANGE 

JL What are you considering?

(screaming)

SJ Did you hear that?

ALT Poor, sweet Saga.

My poor Saga.

Perfect golden eye.

What did he do to your beautiful eye?

SJ I should have killed him.

I wanted to kill him.

Why didn't I?

ST The organics came, and now we have lost another sister.

They will always fear us, always turn on us, hunt us, kill us.

In one day, our enemies will be here with overwhelming force, intent on exterminating us.

That gives us just enough time.

JL Just enough time for what?

ST When I melded with her mind, I experienced the so-called Admonition.

But unlike you, I understood it.

For you, it was a warning.

For us, it was a promise.

ALT Apparently, there are some sort of higher synthetic beings out there, watching us.

The subspace frequencies needed to contact them are encoded in the Admonition.

ST Dr. Soong and I have designed a suitable beacon to summon them.

We can have it transmitting before the Romulan fleet arrives.

JL Why?

ALT So that no more of my children have to die.

This new federation unites synthetic life-forms in a... powerful alliance spanning galaxies.

ST They don't just unite.

Their purpose is to seek out advanced synthetic life and excise it from the oppression by organics.

JL Excise? 

ST Let's say they eliminate the threat of extermination that all organic life-forms ultimately pose.

JL Did you just say "all"?

ST Are you and your Federation any different from the Romulans?

Banning synthetics was just a way of exterminating us in advance.

JL So... you're going to destroy us all.

You will become mass murderers.

ST I'm not like you, Picard.

I will rescue those I can rescue.

My people will survive.

JL And you will fulfill their prophecy.

You will become the Destroyer after all.

Everyone.

After the ban, after the Ibn-Majid, I understand why you did not trust the Federation, why you might not have trusted me, but... I have a ship, and there is room for all of you.

I will see to your safety, and when you are safe, I will become an advocate on your behalf.

I will speak to the Federation with your voice.

I will demand that they end the ban.

And the Federation will listen to me.

ALT No, they won't.

Look at them.

They've never met anyone like you before.

That granite face, wisdom and integrity etched into very line.

The eloquence, the conviction.

They don't know what hit them.

Back on Earth, kids, they didn't listen to him after the attack on Mars.

And they're not going to believe him now.

We're gonna have to place you under house arrest.

JL What?

ST We can't let you walk around free, Admiral.

You'll have us all doubting ourselves, losing our conviction.

We can't have that.

Can we, Soji?

SJ No.

We can't.

JL Soji.

SJ Wherever we go, Picard, they will find us.

This isn't the Romulan rescue.

We can't be your means of redemption.

We're too busy trying to survive.

ST Her, too.

AGN No, don't lock me up. I know I don't deserve it.

But I am begging you... you... all of you are the culmination of... everything I've worked for my whole life, every thing that has ever mattered to me.

I've been through so much to get here.

And now I'm finally where I belong.

If you don't want to do it for me... do it for him.

Let me help him survive what's coming.

ALT Yeah, sh-she has... been quite a help to me. I...

I suppose she's as close to a mother as any of you will ever know.

ST A mother would die for her children.

Would you?

I will know if you're lying.

AGN Yes.

ST Good.

JL Agnes.

ST Take him away.

SEC Long-range sensors show minimal planetary defenses, Commodore.

OH Status?

SEC 24 hours to landfall.

THE END
