PART ONE 
SARU In the past three weeks, Discovery has evolved even more than we could
have imagined.
Her battle scars have been healed.
Internal systems updated.
Programmable matter has been integrated with our pre-Burn technology.
Even her nacelles are now detached, improving maneuverability and
enabling us to be more efficient in flight.
Her retrofit is nearly complete.
It is quite extraordinary, the journey we have had.
We are grateful to have assisted Federation planets in the deepest
regions of the galaxy, and equally grateful to be home.
We are now ready to be of service here, in any way we can be.
VN Welcome back to the fleet, Discovery.
And your crew?
SAR Adapting and retraining as needed.
Commander Burnham is overseeing the process.
VN Thank you, Captain Saru.
Okay. Let's get to it.
Reilling VII needs additional shields.
They're dealing with solar flares. Kardashev?
KAR We'll bring them some shade, sir, if they can last a week.
VN They can.
Kaijur XII needs replicator replacement technology.
They've got a severe food shortage. Captain Rahma?
That'll be your assignment.
RA Aye, sir.
VN Captain Bandra. Le Guin will take the supply run to Na'Seth.
We'll see you in two months.
BAN Yes, Admiral.
SAR With respect, Admiral, given severely limited warp travel, if time is
of the essence...
VN No question.
I could use ten of you right now.
But as my only rapid responder, I need you here.
L'TEIS Rapid responder?
Sir.
VN Discovery has an experimental advanced-drive system that enables us to
respond instantaneously anywhere in the galaxy.
Word of this critical asset will not leave this room until I say so.
Now, Argeth is on yellow alert.
Our intel says that the Emerald Chain might be making another move in
the next 12 hours.
SAR The Andorian/Orion syndicate?
VANCE In this part of the quadrant, yes.
Osyraa and the Chain have been pushing hard lately.
I don't know what they're after on Argeth, but they're damn sure not
gonna get it.
If things heat up, I'm gonna need you to jump, Captain.
SAR We will be ready, Admiral.
VN Dismissed.
TLY Are we supposed to get new holo-PADDs, too?
WL You already have them.
( Gasps softly )
RHYS Cool.
TLY Okay. This is my new favorite thing.
WL Your new badges also function as tricorders.
And communicators and personal transporters, but we'll get to those
later.
There are also upgrades to your consoles.
Check it out.
TLY Doesn't seem that different.
WILLA Our team kept the interface similar for ease of transition, but once
you engage...
OWO Whoa. What just happened?
WL That's the retrofitted programmable matter.
It reads your bio-signs.
DET Do we really need all of this?
BRY Hell yeah, we do.
WILLA It's adaptive.
Learns and adjusts to your reflexes to create an interface style
unique to you.
OWO Wow.
Feels smooth... and cool.
Like glass.
LINUS Whoops. Didn't expect to...
This isn't the mess hall. ( Clears throat )
Uh, bye.
( Laughter )
NIL Apparently, he hasn't adapted yet.
( Alert chimes )
BRY Uh, Lieutenant Nilsson, we are being hailed by a vessel outside of the
Federation's distortion field.
WILLA No one gets here unless they know where they're going.
On screen.
( Static crackling )
( Purring )
( Meows )
TLY Grudge?
BOOK Hey, Michael.
I'm recording this message in case I can't tell you in person.
I was on my way to the Bajoran exchange, when this guy sitting next to
me started talking about a black box.
And I think his black box is one of the ones you're looking for.
It's on Hunhau. Emerald Chain territory.
I'm going to do some looking around.
If things don't go well, I'll set the ship to bring Grudge to you if
I'm not back on board in 24 hours.
Now, despite her glacial emotional process, her initial reluctance
towards you is melting away.
I'll come find you two.
Okay? I won't be long.
BRN This was three weeks ago.
SAR What would the black box tell us about the Burn?
BRN Since it has a record of any ship's last moments, every vessel
destroyed by the Burn should have stopped recording at the same
microsecond, but the two that I found in my year here didn't.
If Book found a third one out there, and it shows the same variance,
that means the Burn didn't happen all at once.
SAR Suggesting what?
BRN Suggesting the Burn had a point of origin, and we can triangulate the
data from the boxes to locate it.
We have got to get to Hunhau.
SAR I'm so sorry, Michael, but at the moment, we cannot.
BRN Why?
SAR Well, the admiral has ordered Discovery to be ready to jump to Argeth
within the next 12 hours.
BRN Ah. It won't take me nearly that long.
SAR Commander.
To be clear, the situation there could heat up any time in the next 12
hours.
BRN Captain, the Federation cannot stabilize while the cause of the Burn
remains a question.
And there's a man's life at stake.
SAR There are many lives.
Today, I saw how vulnerable the Federation has become.
The admiral would not be convinced by a cat in a ship.
I understand this will be difficult, but please resume your duties and
prepare the crew for a possible jump to Argeth.
BRN Yes, sir.
( Door whooshes open )
I can't do nothing.
You're the only person on this ship who'd say yes to going on an
unsanctioned mission.
If I'm right about this box, then I'll be bringing back proof about
what caused the Burn.
GRG You're far too smart not to realize you're dropping Saru in the fire.
He's trying to prove his legitimacy, and his Number One is running all
around the galaxy, disobeying direct orders.
Which has a very familiar ring.
BRN I'd rather regret something I did than something I didn't.
GRG Now we're getting somewhere.
BRN Are you in or out?
Georgiou?
GRG You had me at "unsanctioned mission".
( Exhales )
Hunhau is an M-class planet.
Sparsely populated. Looks like they mainly salvage ships.
Just so I'm clear, what is our primary objective?
BRN The black box.
And Book.
GRG So, what does this cat-loving friend have that made you fall for him
like a two-year-old on the edge of a well?
BRN Excuse me?
GRG The Tyler thing ended in disaster... surprise, surprise... so I get
why you wouldn't want to have feelings for the blob whisperer.
BRN I don't have feelings for the blob whisperer.
And trance worms aren't blobs.
GRG I was referring to the cat.
And you seem to know this ship pretty intimately.
BRN I spent a lot of time here. I didn't love here or anything.
I had my own ship.
What?
GRG You said "love here".
BRN I said "live here".
GRG "Love here".
BRN You're not qualified to judge these things.
Your emotional spectrum runs from cranky to homicidal.
( Echoes ): And why are you bringing up Tyler anyway?
GRG San!
San!
BURNHAM It's still raising my heart rate.
I don't even need this caffeine right now.
Espresso.
( Distorted ) Do you want an espresso?
GRG No.
BRN Philippa?
What is going on?
I know something's happening with you.
( Exhales )
( Alert chiming )
GEORGIOU Looks like a war zone.
BURNHAM It was caused by the Burn.
I've seen these ship graveyards all over.
The only populated area is heavily shielded.
I can't get a lock on Book's life sign.
We're being hailed.
TLR  This planet's a private salvage yard.
BRN Why don't you get our gear?
TLR What are you doing here?
GRG I must be here to buy some salvage, meat sack.
TLR  All buyers go to the local Bajoran exchange.
GRG I'm not interested in getting ripped off by an avatar.
You insult me.
My servant and I are transporting down.
TLR Do that, and my auto-defense systems will take you out.
I decide who's authorized to land, and when.
GRG You don't look smart enough to run this dump.
How soon before your boss finds out I have real dilithium on board I
am willing to part with, and you're making me hover like a peasant?
TLR  Hang on.
Real dilithium?
GRG What did I just say?
Imbecile. You want to let this prize go?
You don't think your boss is watching you watching me?
I am losing my patience.
TLR Well...
GRG Form a sentence!
TLR  All right... you're cleared to land.
But I've got my eyes on you.
GRG I don't care about your eyes, unless they were dangling from my belt.
BRN Really?
GRG He is a bully.
They crumble like a cookie when they meet a bigger one.
What is that?
BRN Cat collar.
To find Grudge, if she ever got lost.
GRG That cat can't get lost.
It's got its own gravitational pull.
BRN No, Book never went anywhere without the receiver.
So I reverse-engineered it.
What he used to find her will now find him.
GRG The things we do for love.
BRN Let's just go find what we're here to find before I strangle you.
PART TWO 
( Grudge meows )
TLY Grudge. Hello.
( Meows )
On my bed?
Hey there, partner.
Pick you up.
Um, just, full disclosure, I'm not a cat person.
So you're gonna have to go back in the box, bud.
( Mewls )
Computer, locate Burnham.
COMPUTER Commander Burnham is not on board.
TLY Did you eat her?
Computer, scan shuttle bay for Cleveland Booker's ship.
COMP Unable to locate.
TLY Come here, kitty.
( Mewling )
Come...
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No-no-no-no, there's...
( Laughing )
You got to come here, bud.
( Purring )
You got to go back in the box.
( Sighs )
I don't like you.
BURNHAM Book said he already found a black box, but if you see any others
while we're down there, grab them.
GEORGIOU Out from under the idiot's nose?
Child's play.
TOLOR No merchandise until I get your dilithium.
And you don't get your weapons back until you leave.
GRG If I wanted to kill you, I wouldn't need a weapon.
And from the looks of this place, they'd name a holiday after me.
So who put you in charge?
TLR  I'm Osyraa's nephew.
This is her territory.
What makes you think...
GRG What makes you think?
Oh, don't tell me you have actual brain matter, or whatever nephews
have.
BURNHAM Where do you get your help from?
All these people. Beta VI?
Marin-Jira?
TLR  They owe Osyraa.
They work for us forever.
It's pretty simple.
GRG I'd love to meet this Osyraa.
She sounds like my kind of girl.
We're going over there.
BRN She's looking for self-sealing stem bolts from the late 24th century.
TLR  Down there.
Hang a right at the entrance.
Next to the plasma coils.
You should be able to find what you're looking for.
GEORGIOU I'm particularly interested in any pre-2400 items.
TLR  These ships are old as dirt.
There's plenty of good scrap in 'em.
Here.
GRG Please. Half of those parts didn't even exist in that era.
Now, this has all its original parts.
930 years old, and it still works.
Don't touch.
( Meow sound over device )
TOLOR Move it.
BRN Captain, there's more over there.
GRG Let's go.
MAN ( OVER P.A. ) Attention, Sector Six arriving workers. Report immediately to Melting
Forge Three for mandatory security protocols and implantation.
RYN I'm sorry, I have to do this.
Try to relax, it'll only hurt for a minute.
MAN Get off me, traitor.
LAI Ah.
( Clang )
BK Hey, come on, watch that elbow, Lai.
LAI I'm good.
BK Not since that regulator tried to separate you from it.
I got this, okay?
RYN Hey, Lai, I found some Tala bark.
I thought it might help with your elbow.
LAI Anything from you is nothing I need.
BK Ryn, let him go.
RYN They think I want to be this guy.
BK They know Osyraa will kill you slow if you say no.
Just try and not take it personal.
We're all just trying to...
RYN Who is that?
BK Um... friend. Just keep your eyes down.
SEC Hey!
Drop it!
LAI What?
Show me.
BK Hey, come on, take it easy.
TOLOR You! Shut up.
Are you stealing from me?
LAI It's just a water ration.
TLR  Just a water ration.
We work hard to bring you all the water you need.
I guess that's not enough.
BK Tolor, please...
( Grunts )
TOLOR Open the door.
We haven't tested the new system updates on the perimeter pylons.
Maybe you'll go free, or you might not.
There's only one way to find out.
Three...
( Hand cannon fires )
LAI Please don't.
TLR  Two...
( Cannon fires )
One!
Faster.
( Screaming )
Faster!
I guess it does work.
Get back to work.
GRAY I don't get it.
Why are you shutting yourself away in this goldfish bowl?
ADIRA I'm working.
GRY There's a basketball court out there, and bocce.
And fencing.
ADI Enticing.
GRY Adira, we're on this amazing moving world, and I've only seen where
you sleep, work and eat.
ADI And these are all vital functions.
GRY Could we make a new memory, please?
STAMETS Who moved the intermix pods?
Ergonomics don't make any sense.
ADI That's way above my pay grade.
Talk to the admiral.
STA Yes, well, the admiral expects us to jump to Argeth at any time.
This place is in chaos.
Nothing's where it's supposed to be.
ADI Oh, these crazy kids and their chaos.
STA Linus, don't do that.
LINUS Sorry. New badge. Hmm?
ADI The spore drive's new and improved.
I redesigned it so you won't have to use those shunts.
STA Well, it's a lot more comfortable.
A little gooey.
ADI Nanogel.
It acts as a quantum transducer.
Slips right off. No residue.
STA Thank you.
GEORGIOU His death was efficient.
TOLOR Thank you. And now you know what happens when you break the rules.
GEORGIOU So I saw.
A little messy, but I assume that's the point.
I want to buy the tech for that fencing system.
TLR  Proprietary. Owned by Osyraa.
Not for sale.
GRG How disappointing.
How do you control the perimeter fence?
From your office?
TLR  I can't say.
GRG The controls are in your pocket.
I know because you keep touching them.
Servant, we're shopping.
Uh, I want those magnetic interlocks and two plasma conduits.
BRN Ma'am, you also wanted warp coils to melt down for cortenum.
GRG Mm-hmm.
BRN Buy me some time.
GRG Okay, go.
What kind of rubbish do you have down here?
TOLOR Well, we've got some tritanium power coils...
BRN Bring me more.
BK At the back shelves.
( Burnham sighs )
WOMAN ( OVER P.A. ) 45 minutes to shift change.
BK ( Whispering ) You weren't supposed to come.
BRN The hell I wasn't. God.
And you sent a passive-aggressive holo, so...
BK What? I sent a passive-passive holo, which said, "I'm coming here". It
didn't say, "Come here, too".
BRN Oh, I didn't need to. That was the aggressive part.
I got to get you out of here.
BK You can't. I'll get myself out.
If I cross that perimeter, what happened to that guy who ran happens
to me.
BRN I know.
BK I got the black box.
Okay?
It's in the wall of my quarters.
You just need to get it and go.
BRN I'm not leaving you.
BK You see that clock?
43 minutes until the shift change.
Then I'm in one of those ships up top for a week.
There's no time.
BRN 43 minutes is plenty of time.
BK Osyraa breaks people. Understand?
Ryn, the Andorian, he was born into the Emerald Chain.
He tried to rally the people against them.
People were beginning to listen.
So she hacked off his antennae and made him the guy that plants this
thing.
Now he's a pariah.
BURNHAM We are gonna get you and everybody out.
And I have an idea.
( Whispering ) Remember Iso VII?
TLR  What's taking them so long?
GRG I pay her to be thorough.
BRN Found what we were looking for.
They were buried pretty deep.
Uh, I'll need 40 minutes to properly clean and inspect them.
GRG 40 minutes? Huh.
That's a lifetime.
( Loud crash )
TOLOR What the hell?!
Get a drone to stay on them.
What do you idiots think you're doing?
PART THREE 
TLY Let's do a pre-check on oxygen and nitrogen levels in main bay.
ENSIGN Uh, what about the...
TLY New stabilization system?
Just about to get to that.
So, if it overloads when Commander Stamets engages, just lock it down
and reroute to containment.
Got it?
ENSIGN Okay.
SAR Ensign Tilly.
TLY Ah... Sir.
Uh, sorry. I was just re-running some tests with the new spore drive
interface, in case we need to jump quickly.
SAR I appreciate your diligence.
Might I speak with you privately?
TLY It's about Michael, right?
SAR I was hoping against all logic you could explain her absence.
TLY ( Chuckles ) Sorry, no. Uh...
Came into my room and Grudge was there, and...
( Sighs )
Sure she has a reason for keeping us both in the dark.
SAR Commander Burnham left to pursue a mission of her own against my
direct orders.
TLY Oh, shit. Sh... shit, shit.
Sorry.
SAR My sentiments exactly.
I will be honest, Ensign.
I have not felt this mistrusting of her since we served on the
Shenzhou.
I assumed, after all we have endured together, that this feeling would
never return.
TLY Sir, you know Michael is one of the people that I love m-most in this
world, but she made a choice, and now because of that, you don't have
one.
You have to tell the admiral.
SAR I expected you to try talking me out of it.
TLY I know. Me, too, but...
Discovery still has a lot to prove, and if Admiral Vance finds out and
you're not the one who told him?
The entire crew will get painted with the same brush.
SAR That is astute, Ensign.
TLY I might've done the same thing in her shoes.
Just for the record.
SAR For the record, I do not believe you would have.
BRN I think I see tritanium over there.
GEORGIOU Good. Maybe I'll keep you around, servant.
BRN How long before they notice?
( Alarm blaring )
SEC Get back to work.
BK You know what to do?
BURNHAM How many weapons can you build from this?
GRG We'll have time for one.
There we go.
One blast, then we'll have the perimeter controls.
I love me.
BRN ( Sighs ) Let's go.
REGULATOR Freeze!
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!
RYN I told as many of the others as I could.
I don't know if they believed me, but I tried.
BK You did good, Ryn.
RYN Here.
I got it. The black box.
Who are these friends of yours?
BK Very handy, excellent friends.
RYN Okay.
BK Five minutes till shit gets real.
RYN What if I can't do this?
BK You got those for standing up to the Chain.
You got this.
All you got to do is, uh, run, and you and I, my friend, are getting
out of here.
All of us, on a transport ship.
SARU There is no doubt Commander Burnham made a serious error in judgment.
But you can be assured that the absence of our Number One will not
impact our ability to respond to any potential conflict on Argeth.
WILLA The Cuyahoga's back.
VANCE Well, make sure they clear the ship before doing the baryon sweep.
I'm glad to hear you can cope without your Number One, Captain,
because we are having trouble keeping our head above water with oldfashioned diplomacy.
Emerald Chain has pulled out of talks.
Stand by to jump on my orders.
SAR We will begin preparations, Admiral.
VN Dismissed.
GEORGIOU You think you're two steps ahead of us, but you're not.
I don't know why you're even bothering.
I keep telling you, you're too stupid.
TLR  You didn't come here for salvage.
( Grunts )
GRG ( Chuckles ) At this point, I'm almost proud it occurred to you.
SEARCHING REGULATOR Sir, I found what you're looking for. 30 units of pure dilithium.
( Tolor chuckles )
TLR  Not as smart as you thought.
Now who's the meat sack?
BRN That would be a bad idea, to fire that weapon.
If Osyraa sniffed out what we had on our ship and wanted to know our
story, she would kill you for killing us.
( Alarm blaring )
MAN ( OVER P.A. ) Attention, Sector Five worker, report for shift change.
BK Let's go!
( Workers shouting )
BK Stay with me! Let's go!
Get to the ship!
WOMAN ( OVER P.A. ) Unauthorized perimeter door accessed.
( Screaming )
BK Go! Go!
( Grunting )
RYN The perimeter fence is still on.
They'll come through.
( Grunting )
GEORGIOU San!
BURNHAM Get the controller!
Get the controller!
RYN We can't stay here.
( Tolor and Burnham grunting )
( Wheezes )
GEORGIOU Got it.
You got to be kidding me.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.
BK Let's go.
Let's go, go, go! The perimeter's down!
Come on! This way!
On me. Let's move!
RYN We can make it.
BK Come on!
( Panting )
Get on the transport ship!
Come on!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Go on! Go on!
Come on!
Come on!
( Indistinct shouting )
Come on!
Bring him down!
RYN Book!
BK Come on. To the ship.
( Screams )
Oh, no, no, no, no.
( Screaming )
I got you. I got you.
Hey, stay with me.
Hey. Hey, hey.
I got you. I got you.
Stay with me. Okay?
( Shouts )
Ryn, Ryn.
Hey, hey. Hey.
Hey, look at me.
RYN Get out of here.
BK Come on, come on. Stay with me.
( Indistinct shouting )
( Whoops )
( Grunts )
Come on.
( Book shouts indistinctly )
Michael!
Michael!
BRN I got you.
( Ryn gasping )
BK Stay with me. Okay?
Stay with me.
GEORGIOU Salvage this, you son of a bitch.
(GEORGIOU crashes ship into Orion Slave Camp)
PART FOUR
BRN I've alerted sickbay on Discovery.
BOOK The black box I promised.
I hope it helps you find what you're looking for.
BRN ( Quietly ) Thank you.
So... we are going to talk about what happened back there.
You could have gotten us killed.
GRG Don't you think I know that?
BRN Then tell me what's going on.
You don't know, do you?
Philippa, how long has this been happening?
GRG A couple of weeks.
And it's getting more severe.
BRN You could have come to me.
I could have helped.
GRG Until I understand what's going on, there's nothing to ask for.
BRN That's not true. Discovery is filled with people...
GRG You will tell no one.
BRN This isn't the Terran universe.
GRG ( Scoffs )
BRN A vulnerability is not a death sentence.
You're not alone.
We'll get through this.
Trust me.
GRG I remember another Michael Burnham telling me to trust her.
She looked just as sincere as you do now.
And we know how that ended.
( Indistinct chatter )
STA You're talking to yourself.
I don't think you're crazy, for what it's worth.
But I'm... curious.
ADI You won't believe me.
STA You have no idea what goes on around here.
( Quiet laugh )
Okay.
ADI Let me just say there's no head injuries.
STA Okay.
ADI I was talking to my boyfriend.
He's Trill.
I got my symbiont from him.
When he died.
STA Um... my understanding of Trill is that... you're supposed to be
carrying his memories, not...
ADI His soul?
Yeah, I-I don't know how it happened this way, either.
Maybe because we were so close.
STA Well, I'm, um... filling in the blanks a bit, but it sounds like
you're holding onto someone you love.
And I did that with Hugh while he was gone.
Before he died, I thought of life and death as this linear thing with
a distinct beginning and end.
And now I know life will always surprise me.
So... if you tell me that he's still with you... what's his name?
ADI Gray.
STA Gray.
I believe you.
ADI He... says I need to make friends.
But I don't know.
STA Well, he realizes you have a lot to give.
ADI What, you think I have something to give?
STA Are you kidding?
You can accomplish things none of us can even imagine.
Including me, and I've imagined more than most.
ADI You're kind of, like, the bomb, huh?
STA I was until you showed up.
( Laughs )
GRY I like this guy.
( Laughs )
ADI He, um... he says he likes you.
STA Well, he's clearly a genius.
( Laughing )
ADI I think I can help you with this.
BRN How's he doing?
Any news?
BK Dr. Pollard said it would take some time, but, uh... he's gonna make
it.
BRN I'm glad.
And you?
BK Yeah, I mean, device is gone for good.
Neck's a little stiff, but she said the swelling should go down in a
few days, I hope.
Time to face the firing squad, huh?
BRN Yeah.
We'll see.
BK Look, uh...
I'm sorry I put you in this position.
BRN You didn't.
BK I hope you don't regret it.
BRN How could I?
( Turbolift stops )
BK Thank you.
Thank you for saving my life.
BRN I'm glad I found you.
BK We always find each other.
LINUS Oh.
( Both exhale )
This is not the science lab.
( Huffs )
( Both laugh )
BRN We have these new badges.
( Laughs )
HUGH So we have Adira to thank for this?
STA God, I hated those things.
HUGH I hated them more.
It's amazing.
And she's only 16.
STA She trusted me today.
HUGH And that's bad, why?
STA Because I've never had time to be a tween's confidante.
HUGH ( Laughing ) Paul.
She's not gonna invite you to her slumber party.
Why do you think you reached out to her today?
STA Because she's brilliant and... seemed to have a hard time with people
or doing anything besides work.
HUGH Remind you of anyone?
STA And... because she loves someone who died.
But isn't gone.
I never... ever thought I'd meet anyone who knew what that was like.
And...
I guess I'm grateful to her.
And I want to help her somehow.
And she has no idea.
HUGH So tell her.
VN Your job is to follow orders, Captain.
But I need to rely on your judgment.
Commander Burnham's mission was 100% rogue but also an unexpected
opportunity.
If asked, I may have deemed the intel worth the risk.
SAR Noted, sir.
VANCE Commander Burnham, why don't you tell me what I'm about to say?
BRN The source of the Burn is not an issue that you have the luxury of
pursuing.
VN Correct.
BRN Because every day you have a hundred fires you have to put out.
VN Correct.
BRN And I disobeyed a direct order and undermined my captain's authority.
And yours.
VN Correct.
For a hot second there, it looked like Discovery may have had to
engage with the Emerald Chain without her Number One.
Did you think about the position you put your captain in?
You put Starfleet in?
As far as I'm concerned, when you jumped through that wormhole, you
were doing your job.
You're here now.
And every mission, you start from zero.
The only reason you're not in the brig is because you saved lives.
Am I being clear, Commander Burnham?
BRN Very clear, sir.
Permission to speak?
VN It had better be the best thing I've ever heard.
For the last year, I have spent every single day searching for the
source of the Burn.
Until we solve the mystery of how it happened and why, I believe the
Federation will never be...
can never be... brought back together again.
VN Well, we'll see what your intel brings, Commander.
I will leave it up to you, Captain, to determine the consequences of
her insubordination.
SAR Thank you, Admiral.
BRN I am sorry.
SAR The admiral made some excellent points.
And I will continue to reflect on the way I have handled all this.
We both made mistakes.
I was particularly disappointed.
BRN That was...
SAR While I agree with your intentions, the decision I am now forced to
make comes down to one thing and one thing only, Commander.
It's not about your skill.
It's not about your ability.
It is about trust.
In your defense, you were clear in your ambivalence when I asked you
to be my Number One.
In my desire to... return to a sense of... things as they were.
But as we keep learning...
... things are not as they were.
BRN No, they're not.
SAR I take no pleasure in this.
But... as of now, you are relieved of your duty as my Number One.
You will restrict yourself to chief science officer duties only.
BRN Saru?
You're doing the right thing.
SAR One day... we will find the answers we are all looking for, Michael.
( Exhales )
I want the truth for all of us. Did my crew and I worked together to
save all sentient life in the universe? Didn't you see all of us...
imperfect and flawed as we all are... still live up to our best
ideals. It is the greater good I am fighting for. Together you could
create something bigger than yourselves.
It's what the Federation is.
