PART ONE 
BOIM: Ensign Boimler, personal log,

stardate 57601.3.

The Cerritos is in orbit
around Mixtus III to assist

in a controlled demolition
of an unstable moon.

We're providing support
to the Vancouver,

a Parliament-class ship
which focuses

on complex, large-scale
engineering projects.

V CAP: Welcome, Captain. Take it in.

One day you could be in command
of a vessel like the Vancouver.

CAP: Thank you, Captain. This is
truly a humbling experience.

V CAP: You're welcome.

Unfortunately, we might have
to cancel the demolition.

CAP: - What? Why?
RAN: - Is the moon too dense?

V CAP: No, it's more
of a diplomatic issue.

CAP: Diplomatic? Isn't the moon going
to plummet into the planet

RAN: - And ignite the atmosphere?
- And, you know, kill everyone?

V CAP: I've told them that many times,
but they simply don't care.

MIXTUS CIT:  -You don't know what you're talking...
-Of all the moons we pray to,

That's one
of the most important!

MIXTUS CIT: It controls the tides
for our summer crop.

MIXTUS CIT: My family has lived
on that moon for generations.

MIXTUS CIT: Moons can't plummet.
That's something the government

made up to control us.

CAP: Ooh, boy.

BOIM: So the moon's decaying
orbit could cause catastrophic


 


blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah... okay, okay.

The real news is I get to
have lunch with the coolest,

smartest officer in Starfleet,
Barbara Brinson,

Who also happens
to be my girlfriend.

That's right. Ugh!

We met a month ago
and it's just been magical.

MAR: Ooh, boy, here we go.

Log number one million
about Girlfriend Barb.

You know, I am sorry,
but I'm starting to think

that Barb might
not actually exist.

BOIM: Oh, she's real.

She's as real as a hopped-up
Q on Captain Picard Day.

MAR: Let me guess, when we meet her,

it'll weirdly have to be
on the holodeck.

BOIM: Hey. I don't do that anymore.

MAR: -Okay?
-Sure you don't, man. But just so you know,

- I am still gonna try waving my hand through her.
BOIM: - Please don't.

MAR: - I'm gonna.
BOIM:- You're gonna hit skin.

MAR: Well, if I do,
it's the cost of doing business.

RUTH: Ooh. You smell that, Tendi?

Each ship on the fleet
has its own scent.

I think the Cerritos smells like

Toasting marshmallows
on a cool night.

TEN: Is that a plasma fire?

RUTH: Huh? Oh... uh, uh...

The D53 probably sparked again.

They're so buggy.

Yeah, the whole ship's
kind of falling apart.

Yep, this old girl's
seen a lot of light-years.

TEN: You know, Kula told me
the Vancouver

has fluidic processors

that self-replicate
their own silicas.

RUTH: Nuh-uh!

TEN: And he said they had
tritanium hull brackets.

RUTH: - T88s.
- That can't be right.

RUTH: - T88s aren't even out yet.
TEN: - I know.

TEN: It's a starship, not heaven.

RUTH: I can't believe it.

RUTH: This is the greatest ship
I've ever seen.

TEN: Are you kidding me?
This is amazing.

MAR: Uh, guys? It's basically, like,
the same ship as the Cerritos.

RUTH: Yeah, right.

TEN: Ooh, let's go look
at their thermal mesh.

RUTH: I bet it's a double lattice!

TEN: Double lattice!

BOIM: Where's Barb?
She said she'd meet me here.

MAR: Oh, this is too sad. Hey, look.

I can set you up with somebody
great on the Cerritos.

There's that
Phylosian in tactical.

She seems like
a nice plant person.

BARB: Brad!

MAR: Uh, wha... Uh, c-computer,
end program.

BARB: I missed you so much.

MAR: Ugh.

BARB: Mmm.

BOIM: - We kissed, did you see?
BARB: - Hi. Sorry.

BARB: It's been a long month.
I'm Lieutenant Barbara Brinson.

MAR: Um, yeah... I'm, uh,
I'm Beckett Mariner,

- and this is Boimler.
BARB:- Yeah, I know.

BARB:Oh! I can't wait
to show you everything.

Come on.

MAR: She's a lieutenant?

BARB: You know, whatever,
it was no big deal.

I managed to reverse
the polarity

and reboot the time stream.

Good thing, too,
'cause, oof, 1920s Chicago?

Nobody's washing their hands.

BOIM: Oh, I love that story, bun-bun.

- Mwah, mwah.
MAR: - Wow, all that's so amazing.

And now you date Brad.

BARB: Ugh, I know. I swore
I'd never do long-distance.

But then I met this goofball
on Vendu last month.

He radiates a primal confidence.
I'm sure you've felt it.

MAR: No, I try not to feel
anything around Brad.

JET: - Barbasaurus Rex!
BARB: - Jet?

JET: Get up here.
We're gonna be working together.

BARB: - Ah! Whoa.
BOIM: - Uh...

BARB: - Really?
BOIM- Okay, you can maybe put her down now.

- Like, anytime.
MAR: - Whoa, whoa, whoa.

JET: Did you hear some purple people
are throwing a tantrum?

Implosion's been postponed.

We got to recalibrate the whole
goddamn containment field.

BARB: Oh, Boim-Boim.

Looks like I can't do lunch
on the Cerritos.

BOIM: Oh, no, it's fine.
It's not like I programmed

A ten-course meal or anything.

JET: Hey. See you in Engineering.

And I'll try not
to bring it downtown.

BARB: Shut up.

JET: -No, you shut up.
JET: -Shut up. -Huh?

Ow. Ow, no, you shut up. Stop.

MAR: Wait, how do you know Jet?

MAR: He's, like, the second
coolest person on the Cerritos.

BARB: Ugh, we dated, like,
a billion years ago.

MAR: - What?
BARB: - But he's nothing compared to my Bradward.

MAR: Oh!
Your real name is Bradward?

BOIM: Yeah, I'm a Bradward. There's
Bradleys, there's Bradwards.

BARB: It feels so good to be near you.

Mwah!

MAR: Well, I got to hand it to you.
You were right.

Barb is great.

A little too great.

DOC: Hey. Ron Docent. Welcome aboard

the Vancouver.

She's a beaut, isn't she?

Oh, yeah.

So, the captain, your captain,

has ordered us to look
for alternatives to implosion.

I'm gonna have you two
run diagnostics

On the simulation mainframe.

You both comfortable using T88s?

RUTH: Yes, sir. So comfortable.

Super comfortable.

DOC: Ha. I like that enthusiasm.

Tell you what,
whoever finishes first

gets their very own T88.

TEN: Wait. You mean, like,
we get to keep them?

Or-or is this, like,
a borrow thing?

Like, we're gonna have
to give them back, right?

DOC: Nope. I mean keep,
like "you keep it."

DOC: - Ah!
TEN: - Sorry, sir.

TEN: Just checking
if this is a dream.

MAR: I've got a bad feeling
about Barb.

BOIM: I know. I can't believe
she used to date Jet!

BOIM: That guy's like a Kirk sundae
with Trip Tucker sprinkles.

MAR: I'm not messing around.

MAR: Barb is way, way,
way out of your league.

BOIM: Not out of Jet's league. I...

BOIM: Uh, I-I got to get jacked.
Here we go.

MAR: Brad, when
a Starfleet relationship

MAR: seems too good to be true, then...

red alert, man... it probably is.

BOIM: You think she's cheating on me?!

MAR: No! I think she's a secret alien
who's gonna eat you

or a Romulan spy
or a salt succubus

or an android or a changeling

or one of those sexy people
in rompers

that murders you
just for going on the grass!

BOIM: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm sorry, you're saying

that because Barb is awesome
and hot and dating me

That she's an alien?

That is messed up, Mariner!

That is not cool.

MAR: This is real, Bradward.

I have seen stuff, man.

Like back when I was serving
on the Quito...

PART TWO 

MAR You guys...

Ooh, you hear what happened
on the Enterprise?

Apparently,
Data's got an evil twin brother

Who teamed up with the Borg.

Crazy, right?

What? Man, it's like a new thing
every week with those guys.

Right. Like, leave some unknown
for the rest of us.

Aw, you guys
are such a great couple.

FRIEND 1: Oh, what can I say?

I found the perfect guy.

NIKO: Look, I'm not perfect, okay?

But I do have
the perfect friends.
MAR: Uh, no, Niko,
you are the nicest, smartest,

handsomest guy on this ship.

I mean, it's either that

Or you're
a Harvongian shape-changer.

I mean, you're too handsome.

Niko?

No!

CREWMAN: Shape-changer!

Angie!

No...!

MAR: I'm not gonna sit around
and let a face get melted.

Not again.

You're not leaving my sight,
mister.

BOIM: Every minute
Barb spends with Jet

Puts me closer to losing her.


MAR: I got to do something.

And so do I.
CAP: 
Okay, listen up!
We will relocate

three tons of moon dust
for people to worship.

The farmers will have gravity
systems installed for the tides.

And you three,
your ancestral homes

will be relocated
to the sixth moon,

Which will now technically
be the fifth anyway.

Does that work for everyone?
MIXTUS CIT:
-Yeah. 
MIXTUS CIT: -It works for me.
MIXTUS CIT: -Okay.

MIXTUS RICHGUY: No, you don't understand.

This moon blocks pollution
from Mixtus III

From reaching my people
on Mixtus II.

Without this moon, we'll perish.
CAP: 
But if we don't destroy it,

The folks on Mixtus III
will perish.

MIXTUS RICHGUY: I know.
It's an impossible problem.
CAP: 
Well, we're Starfleet.

Figuring out impossible problems
is what we do,

so let's just keep calm
and, uh, try

- to think of a solution.
MIXTUS RICHGUY: - No! If you blow up that moon,

you're murderers!
You'll have blood on your hands!

CAP: Shut up and let me think!

BARB: All right, listen up, everybody.

Each of our orbital platforms
will maintain

- a tractor spread to control lunar debris.
- Ha!

BOIM: "Da Brie"?
What is this, a cheese party?

Hey, babe, it's me. Whoop.

Okay, okay. Yep.

-Okay.
JET: -Hey, don't worry, buddy. I got it.

BARB: All right.

- Thank you, Jet.
JET: - No worries.

BARB: Uh, Brad, um,
what are you doing here?

BOIM: Oh, you know, just wanted to see
my girlfriend do her thang.

Yeah, we're together.

BARB: Uh, anyway,
getting back to the demo...

BOIM: Aah!

Aah!

Whoa, whoa, stop it! Stop it!

Turn it off.
What are you doing?!

MAR: Whoopsies! Sorry. New tricorder.

Okay, she's not an android,
'cause that tone

would have disrupted
her positronic brain.

Whatever she is, she's organic.
Okay, I have to get a sample.

BOIM: Okay, we're gonna... You're gonna leave now.
MAR: I got to...


BOIM: Sorry, guys.
Mariner was just leaving.

BARB: Actually,
maybe you should go with her.

BOIM: We've just got a lot to cover.

BOIM: Oh. But I didn't get
to see you do your thang.

BARB: So sweet of you to come by.

BARB: I'll meet you later
in the mess, okay?

BOIM: Yeah, yeah, no,
the mission comes first.

BARB: Totally. I'll just, you know...

JET: - What I'm talking about.
BOIM: - Oh.

RUTH: I hope
we never blow up that moon.

These T88s are amazing.

TEN: Yeah, they're, like, crazy fast.

TEN: How many diagnostics
have you run?

RUTH: 15. Oh, when I come back
with this baby,

RUTH: The guys in Engineering
are gonna flip.

TEN: Yeah, right. It's
gonna be me who takes this back.

TEN: I'm gonna blow their minds
in Medical.

RUTH: Nope.

RUTH: - 16.
TEN: - 22.

RUTH: 17. 18.

RUTH: - 19. 20. 21.
TEN: - N-N-No!

TEN: - Hey, don't you use your implant.
RUTH: - 22.

TEN: - That's not fair!
RUTH: - Ooh, 23!

MAR: I got to figure this out.
I got to... Wait!

Okay, okay, okay.
So, Barb's not a Dauphin,

but I haven't ruled her out

as a surgically altered
Cardassian spy

or a transporter clone or...

Bear with me, bear with me...
A Suliban.

Right? Right? A Suliban?

BOIM: Mariner, stop it.
Barb's not a Suliban.

MAR: - But how do you know?
- She's nothing but a great human lady.

BOIM: You need to stop spinning out

and accept people
for who they are.

BOIM: Now be quiet. I got to change
everything about me

to trick her into thinking
I'm something I'm not.

BOIM: Computer,
analyze the coolest people

in Earth history
and replicate me an outfit,

boys size small.

BOIM: Jet. Ugh,
he thinks he's all that.

Well, I can be twice as that.
I can be even thatter.

BOIM: Hey, Barb! Get up in here, girl.

BARB: Uh, uh...

BOIM: How's the view?

BARB: That was weird.

BOIM: Sup, shippies?
Anyone want to partake

in a little liquid luncherino?

BARB: What are you talking about?

BOIM: Sip it up.

Replicator, beer, big, hot.

- I mean, cold.
Get... Make it cold.
BARB: Um,

we're still on duty.
What's gotten into you?

BOIM: This is the real Boimler, baby.
Guess you didn't know

You were dating a dude dog
who loves... Whoa!

BARB: Brad!

Oh, oh! Oh, no.

Oh. Mariner, no!

BARB: Ow! What the fuck?
Did you just pull my hair?

MAR: Yeah! D... Yeah,
did you just pull her hair?

That is messed up, bro.
Get out of here

- before I do a citizen's court-martial.
JET: - Come on, Brad, let me give you a hand.
- Don't touch me,

- you big hunk hottie.
BARB:- Okay,

I don't know
what's going on right now.

First, you come in
looking sexy as hell,

but then you ruin it
by acting all weird.

- I have to go back to work.
BOIM:- I-I'll walk you there.

BARB: No! I can walk myself.

Come on, Jet. Walk me.

MAR: --Okay,
good news. Maybe bad news.

I am, like, 99.8% sure
she's a reptoid.

BOIM: Gah, will you just drop it?!
Barb is not anything.

BOIM: - I mean, other than a great lady.
- She said you looked sexy.

MAR: No, there's no way she's human.
That's her tell.

MAR: That is a huge tell.
Look, if she's a reptoid,

she's gonna need to find
a male partner.

MAR: Jab with her reptoid tail.

MAR: Implant her reptoid spawn.
Stay close.

MAR: You're safe with me.

MAR: Brad! No! Brad!

PART THREE

SHAX: Sir, the platforms aren't rated
for low altitudes.

They'll have to be
operated manually.

RAN: Maybe the captain's
making progress.

MIXTUS RICHGUY: You're all murderers! No,
you madmen! You'll have blood

- on your hands!
RAN: - She's doing great.

BARB: There you go, Jet. That's it.

JET: Keep pushing it in.

BARB: - Are you sure it'll fit?
JET: - Huh?

BARB: - We'll make it fit.
BOIM: - Aha!

You're not...

Sex? I heard sex.

BARB: - What? - -

You have been a jerko all day,

and now you accuse me
of cheating?

BOIM: I'm sorry!
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

I was freaking out
because you're so smart

and pretty and funny, and I'm...
I'm just me.

You should be with a guy
like Jet.

BARB: That's what this has been about?

Bradward,
nothing is happening with Jet.

BOIM: Oh, no, I ruined everything!
No! No, no, no!

It's all dissolving.
It's all dissolving.

BARB: Look, I fell for you
because you're you.

A sweet, nervous,
dainty-hipped nugget.

Let's try to start today over.

MAR: Watch out for the tail!

BOIM: Mariner!

BARB: - What's your problem?
MAR: - Where's-where's the tail?

MAR: Reptoids implant
with a barbed tail. They...

Her name is Barb!

Mariner, what the hell?
I told you.

MAR: I just... I thought...

I thought there was a tail.

COM: Lieutenant Brinson,

report
to Orbital Platform Gamma.

We need manual activation.

BARB: Right away, Commander.

BARB: - Hey, come with me?
- Love to.

BOIM: Seems like a good way
to start the day over.

With my human girlfriend!

MAR: How was I so wrong?

Huh? Ugh.

Oh, what?

Exoskeletal husk?

I wasn't wrong!
Barb's a parasite!

Bradward! Bradward, wait!

Bradward!
Get out of my way.

Move! Move, Jennifer.

Bradward! Bradward, wait!

Bradward!

RUTH: - Where's Ron? I want my T88.
TEN: - You wouldn't even know what

to do with a T88. Besides,
they're way better for medical.

RUTH: - What? That's not true.
TEN: - You know what I could do with that?

RUTH: - You know what I could do with it?
- I could solve problems.

TEN: I could figure out
when people are sick.

RUTH: Oh, yeah?
TEN: I could solve problems.

RUTH: - I could...
DOC: - This is great work.

And you finished
at the exact same time.

Looks like you're both
joining the Vancouver.

- Congratulations!
RUTH: - Wait.

TEN: What do you mean,
joining the Vancouver?

DOC: I told you, whoever finished
first would get to keep the T88

and use it here.
On the Vancouver.

RUTH: We-we thought we'd get
to take it back to the Cerritos.

DOC: Hang tight.
I'm gonna write up the transfer.

Don't worry, the admiral used
to be my grandma's neighbor.

Quiet guy.
He'll push it right through.

MAR: Computer, locate Boimler.

Oh, crap, crap, crap, crap.

Requesting emergency transport
to Platform Gamma.

Authorization, uh, Mariner 8.

COM: Request
denied. Is that a made-up code?

COM: -Who is this? Clear this channel!
MAR: -Aah!

Bradward.

Bradward! Bradward, wait!

Oh, no.

Oh, no, I got to get
to Bradward.

Oh, no. Oh, no, Bradward.

Oh, no. Oh, no, Bradward.

BOIM: 
Captain's log.
Long-range sensors

have located a very sexy...

-Mariner! Aah! Stop looking at me!
MAR: 
-Oh, no! Definitely, no!
BOIM: 
- Stop looking at me!
MAR: 
- No. No to this and also that.
BOIM: 
Get out of here!
Barb'll be back any second.
BOIM: 
This is me sex time, okay?
MAR: 
Look at this! It's the husk
of a neural parasite.
BOIM: 
- I don't care! I'm naked.
- You're not listening!
MAR: 
Barb is a parasite.
She's a-a creature of some sort.
MAR: 
All right. Two for emergency... Hey, give it back!
BOIM: 
You'd rather make a fake husk
than admit that you were wrong?

Terrible! Shame on you.

It has been a long time
since I've taken a lover,

let alone a lover like Barb.

I am staying here,

and I am making love
to my lover.

MAR: 
Oh, please stop saying "lover."
COMPUTER: 
Warning. Platform approaching

- Critical altitude.
MAR: - Whoa!
BARB: 
Boimler!

Stay away from him!

RUTH: The Vancouver is awesome.

TEN: The fluidic processors,
the tritanium hull brackets,

the door whoosh.
TEN: 
Whoosh.
RUTH: 
Whoosh.
RUTH: 
Honestly, the Cerritos
might be falling apart,

but that's kind of awesome, too.

It's our job
to keep it together.
TEN: 
Yeah, and the way
that she shakes and creaks

and moans at Warp 7?

I bet the Vancouver
doesn't do that.
RUTH: 
With those inertial dampers?

You got to be kidding me.

And you know what
the Vancouver doesn't have?
TEN: 
- All our friends.
RUTH:
- We have to tell Ron we're staying here.
TEN: 
What if, what if
he gets mad at us?
RUTH: 
He's a professional.
Professionals don't get pissed.
DOC: 
- What?!
RUTH: 
- I'm sorry, but we want to stay on the Cerritos.
DOC: 
Tough! I already
wrote up the transfer.

As soon as I click this button,
it's going through.
TEN: 
Wait a second, you can't just
transfer us against our will!
DOC:
Watch me.
Do I need to remind you

who my grandma's neighbor was?

I guess I do...
It was the admiral!

And he's a psycho.

Hey, you can't do that!

Don't kick me PADD!
That's an order!

Aah!

TEN: Hey, got it!

DOC: Get back here!

MIXTUS RICHGUY: I Don't kill my people!

You're the Federation!

You're the good guys!

Remember the Prime Directive?

CAP: What? That doesn't
even apply here!

RAN: Captain, we're
running out of time.

The flooding has already
started and the platforms

weren't designed for this.

MAR: I'm not letting you
hurt Boimler!

BARB: I'm protecting him!

- From what?
MAR: - Hyah!
BARB: 
From you! You really think I'd
buy you guys are best friends?

He's mousey, sweet and soft

and you're a badass
space adventurer!

--I knew there
was something wrong

from the moment I met you.

Yeah, no, something's wrong with you.

First, I thought you were
a rogue holodeck character.

Then, because of the way you
were lurking around all day,

I thought you were
a Breen infiltrator.

What? That wasn't lurking...
That was protecting!

Finally I realized
you're probably a parasite!
MAR: 
Bitch, you're the parasite!
BARB: 
Exactly what a parasite
would say, parasite!
DOC: 
- Give me back my PADD!
TEN:
- Let's go!

Do not get on that turbolift!
RUTH:
Here's the plan... I'll reroute
the turbolift controls.

You try to guess his passcode!
DOC:
Give me back my PADD!

MIXTUS RICHGUY: The impact on our environment
would affect both of us!

We'd have to move
our whole civilization!

CAP: I know! But how can...?

Wait, "both"? What do you,
what do you mean "both"?

How many people are
in your civilization?

MIXTUS RICHGUY: - Me and my wife.
CAP: - There are two people

On your whole planet?!

MIXTUS RICHGUY: Well, yes, we're,
uh, we're rich.

CAP: Implode the moon.

RAN: - Yes, Captain.
MIXTUS RICHGUY: - You maniacs!

We just redid the floors!

PART FOUR

MAR: This isn't over.

You don't know Boimler
like I do.

He will figure you out.

I mean, sometimes
it takes him a minute.

Hell, on Sendu IV,
it took him a week to realize

he was peeing in their species'
sinks and not their toilets,

but you know what,
he gets there eventually.

BARB: Wait, that was him?

He told me that happened
to a friend.

MAR: Yeah, he wishes.

No, someone came in
to wash their hands,

And just caught him going
right in the sink.

BARB: You know what?
On our second date,

He "shook hands"
with a Lortian's egg sac.

MAR: Oh, stop!

BARB: It was so pissed.

MAR: Okay, and then, and then
Sqill looked at Boimler

and said, "That's my dorsal."

BARB: You guys have been
through a lot together.

MAR: Yeah, I mean he is a dork,
for sure.

But he's my dork.

BARB: Well, you're clearly
not a parasite,

or you wouldn't have let him
in front of the admiral.

MAR: Uh, well, thanks, and, you know,

You're not seeming so much like
a parasite, either, by the way.

BARB: Hey, if it's gonna make you
feel better, just scan me.

MAR: You are a human, yep.

Man, I mean,
you ever get those feelings

like you are just sure
about something?

Like, I was sure
you were a parasite.

But you're actually a very nice,

attractive human woman.

MAR: Uh-oh.

DOC: - Aah!
- This isn't me!

I don't want to stun you.
RUTH: 
- Then don't!
TEN: - Come on, come on!
DOC: 
Give me back my PADD!

RUTH: Look, just hand me
the phaser... ow!
DOC: 
Oh, my God,
you made me stun you!
RUTH: 
I can't feel my hand!
DOC: 
Oh, God, oh, God!
What have I done?

RUTH: -Ow!
TEN:-I got the password... it was "Riker."

DOC: No, no, no, no, no!
Don't read that!

TEN: What the heck?

You're transferring yourself
to the Cerritos?

DOC: I thought we could swap places.

You don't know
what it's like here!

It's so stressful! It's so epic!

It's all,
"Tow this space station,"

and, "Calibrate
the Dyson sphere!"

"Go back in time and kill the
guy that was worse than Hitler!"

I just want to be back
on a smaller ship,

doing simpler work.

I don't want
to be epic anymore!

TEN: Geez, working on
the Vancouver screws you up.

I'm sorry I phasered you.

This is not
Ron Emmanuel Docent, Jr.

Can we just keep this
between us?

RUTH: You'll delete
the transfer order?

There. Done.

TEN: And, um, throw in a T88
for each of us.

DOC: Hey, now, that I can't do.

RUTH: Oh, that's cool. It wasn't
like I was using my implant

to record all this as evidence
for your court-martial.

I was.

DOC: Okay, a couple of T88s
coming right up.

MAR: Ooh! Ugh!

Ooh! Ugh!

It's squishy! Give me a hand!

Oh, my God!
PARASITE: 

BOIM: Stop! Don't! Lover! Lover!
PARASITE: 
Lover! Lover! 
Lover! Lover! Lover!
BOIM: 
Oh, God.

Aah! What the hell was that?
PARASITE: 
It was always me, Barb.

I'm going to treat you
to dinner.

Let me out! Let me out!

BARB: Hmm, apparently,
this species reproduces

by making their host
chemically irresistible

to potential mates.

MAR: So Boimler must have
picked it up...

BARB: Right before he met me, exactly.

BOIM: Wait. Wait.

So are you saying you only liked
me because of the parasite?

BARB: Please. I'm a Starfleet officer.

You think I'd be into a guy
just because of his pheromones?

BOIM: Oh, thank God. I was worried
you were gonna break up with me.

BARB: Yeah, listen, Brad,
you're sweet,

But right now, I need to put
all my energy into my job.

Specifically, studying
this fascinating parasite.
PARASITE: 
Lover! Lover!
Lover! Lover! Lover!

- Lover! Lover! Lover! Lover!
BARB: 
- Mwah.
PARASITE: 
- Lover! Lover! Lover! Lover!
BOIM: 
- Aw.

She did break up with me.

MAR: 
Hey, you'll find someone
who loves you

Without a googa attached
to your skull.
BOIM: 
You're just saying that.

MAR: No, I'm not.
You're a catch, man.

- You're real.
BOIM: - I am real.

BARB: Hey, Mare, see you next month
at the M'tari tournament?

MAR: Oh, you know it, and I'll try
not to bring it downtown.

BARB: Oh, shut up.

BOIM: Wait. You guys made plans?

MAR: We bonded
while you were knocked out.

BOIM: - Over what?
MAR: - Nothing. Just girl stuff.

MAR: So you shook
a Lortian's egg sack?

BOIM: Wait, how did...?
Oh. Oh, no! Oh, no!

TEN: Aah.

The Cerritos might be
falling apart,

but it's nice to be back home.

RUTH: Yeah, I missed that smoky smell.

TEN: So, uh, hey, um,
before we left the Vancouver,

I got you something.

RUTH: You shouldn't have!

TEN: Well, I figured
the Cerritos could use them

- a lot more than...
RUTH: - No, no, no.

I mean, look,
I stole a bunch, too.

TEN: Yup, this...

this is why we're friends.

Chirp.
