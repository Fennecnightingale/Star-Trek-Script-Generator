PART ONE

SPK  As a child, I had what
my mother called "nightmares."

She taught me to control
my fear by drawing them,

rendering fear powerless.

The nightmares have returned.

The same vision,
again and again.

I now understand its meaning
and where it must lead me.

I have encoded it
within this audio file

in the event of my death.

This may be my last entry
aboard the

Enterprise.

BRN Spock has had this tablet
since he was a boy.

I took it from his quarters.

He drew these signals two months
before they appeared to us.

PKE Computer, show me Starfleets
rendering of the seven signals.

Rotate 90 degrees
counterclockwise.

Its damn near identical.

There any more sketches
like this one?

BRN No.

Sir, my brother

sounds deeply troubled.

I know hes on leave, but
we need to contact him,

find out what he knows
about these signals.

PKE I know where Spock is, Burnham.

Have a seat.

Your brother...

is in the psychiatric unit
on Starbase 5.

Since about a week
after he took leave.

Committed to the facility
at his own request.

BRN Why werent my parents or I told

about this request?

Its Starfleet protocol
to reach out to the families...

PKE Unless the patient
doesnt want that,

and Spock said no.

Emphatically.

With that said,

his association
with these signals

outweighs his desire
for absolute privacy.

You could extend an olive branch
to your brother,

but hell need to decide
whether or not to take it.

BRN He wont.

At least not from me.

The way I left things
with my brother...

We havent spoken in years.

PKE Family dynamics
can be complicated.

My father was a
science teacher,

and when he wasnt doing that,
he taught comparative religion.

It was a confusing
household, and...

We didnt agree on a lot.

Look, Ive shared with
you everything I know.

Trust you can do the same
with me.

If theres ever anything
you feel you ought to tell me...

BRN Sir, when we were
on that asteroid...

I...

I never properly thanked you

for coming back to get me.

PKE Youre welcome.

SARUS VOICE Captain Pike
to the bridge immediately.

Captain on
the bridge.

SARU Ah, Captain. Another signal
has just appeared.

BRN The transmission
is too faint to determine

the exact coordinates.

TLY Excuse me, Commander
Burnham. I was using

your station to run
calibration modeling programs.

Let me just close some
of this stuff out.

SAR Ensign Tilly had a notion

to pinpoint the signals.

I gave her permission to try it.

PKE Excellent.

TLY Im modulating

Discoverys
deflector dish.

The idea is that well create
gravimetric distortion

that will act like sonar.

BRN Thats a good plan,

but the signals too
far away to register.

If we were closer,

we might be able to detect
gravitational redshift

and use that to calculate
its exact position.

I suggest we go to
warp momentarily,

then target it with long-range
sensors as soon as we drop out.

PKE Detmer, take us to maximum warp
for five seconds.

DET Aye, sir.

BRN Signal coordinates received.

And its in the Beta Quadrant,

51,450 light-years away.

PKE At top speed,
that would take us

150 years to get that far.

My unborn childrens children

would be lucky
to get there. Ideas?

SAR The spore drive.

But until a nonhuman interface

is found,
Starfleet has decommissioned it.

Or its navigator, really.

BRN In order to guide us
through the mycelial network,

Commander Stamets injected
himself with Tardigrade DNA,

a violation of Starfleets ban

on genetic manipulation.

SAR They were willing
to overlook this

during the war, however.

PKE A Tardigrade?

SAR I suppose you had to be there.

PKE Getting to the bottom

of these signals is of utmost
importance to the Federation.

They let you use the drive
to fight the Klingons.

Theyll give us
dispensation now.

How long before
it can be operational?

TLY Once I begin prepping
Commander Stamets, 20 minutes.

PKE Get to it.

TLY Bet youre glad
you stayed on board, right?

STA Hmm?

TLY Being back in the saddle.
You and me.

Doing our thang.
I thought the jump

to Q'onoS would be the last time
in a long time.

Whats wrong?

STA I saw Hugh in the network.

TLY What? You mean, after he...
after he died?

STA Yes. When I was
trapped there,

he comforted me.

He pushed me to escape
when I was ready to give up.

Discovery

out
of the Terran universe, Tilly.

He saved us all.

I...

I-I know how this sounds.

At first, I told myself it was
a fabrication of my own mind

culled from my memories
by the mycelia,

but since then,
Im not so sure.

I didnt see him

the last time I jumped,

but knowing its
a possibility...

TLY I would think that possibility
would make you happy.

STA Astromycology has taught me

that nothing is ever truly gone.

Fungi are the
universes recyclers.

This is how termination
begets creation.

Its why life is eternal.

And my place is on this
side of that cycle.

If I return to the network
and see him again...

PIKE
We good to go, Mr. Stamets?

MALE All personnel,
prepare for black alert.

This is not a drill.

Repeat, this is not a drill.

Spore drive is on line.

SAR Spore drive is ready, Captain.

Questions or concerns

before we depart, Captain?

PKE If youre telling
me that this ship

can skip across the universe
on a highway made of mushrooms,

I kind of have
to go on faith.

Be bold.

Be brave.

Be courageous. Black alert.

COM All personnel, black alert.

PKE Lets jump.

SAR You never forget
your first, sir.

PART TWO 

PKE Ah.

TLY Commander Stamets...

STA Not now, Tilly.

PKE Theres no sign of the signal.

Are we where
were supposed to be?

BRN Affirmative.

Report.

Class-M planet.

No power signatures
or starships

in the area.

No one scanning us
from the surface.

Wait, I detect
human life signs.

PKE No humans have settled this
far out in the Beta Quadrant.

SAR Captain, Im picking
up a transmission

from the surface.

PKE Send it through, Bryce.

JAC Were under attack!
Were holed up inside.

A few hundred souls:
men, women and children.

PKE Red alert.
Ready photon torpedoes.

Are you sure theres
nobody else out there?

Were alone, Captain.

Pinpoint the distress call.
Show me where its coming from.

Enhance.

SAR They do not seem to be in any
sort of distress, Captain.

PKE Can you trace any
warp signatures

or starships near the planet?

BRN Not a single one.

SAR I can, however, confirm that,

based on audiophonic
degradation,

the transmission has been
broadcasting on a loop for...

200 years.

BRN Thats before warp
was even invented.

PKE Somebody want to tell me
how they got here?

BRN The arrival of those people
on the planet directly coincides

with World War III on Earth-

a nuclear cataclysm that
left 600 million dead

and governments destroyed.

SAR The broadcast frequency
from the surface is obsolete,

too weak for interstellar
communication.

BRN Its all coming
from this structure here.

PKE Its a church, Burnham.

BRN Yes, sir.

PKE Theyre speaking

Federation Standard.

They had to have a starship
to get out this far.

Hell, the only way we got here
was by using a spore drive.

BRN Yet with the roughly
11,000 people,

spread over ten settlements
across the planet,

there is no ship
or power signature to speak of.

They dont even use electricity.

PKE Since their society

is pre-warp, we have to assume
General Order 1 applies.

Why did that

second signal want us
to come here?

BRN As science officer,
I would advise restraint

in ascribing motivation
to what are now simply

unidentifiable energy bursts.

PKE "There are more things in heaven
and earth, Horatio..."

BRN I know my Shakespeare, Captain.

Are you suggesting that
some kind of divine intervention

put those people
on the planet?

PKE I assume youre familiar
with Clarkes Third Law?

BRN Yes.

In the 20th century,
Arthur C. Clarke said that

"Any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable

from magic."

PKE The law was debated

by scientists
and theologians alike,

and later reinterpreted to say:

"Any sufficiently advanced

extraterrestrial intelligence is
indistinguishable from God."

I have no idea

how or why theyre here,

but I highly doubt
its by accident.

BRN Certainly a bold
interpretation, sir.

PKE What else do we know
about the planet?

SAR It is surprisingly Earth-like.

However,

the interweaving orbital rings

are comprised of
radioactive debris.

Quite unlike anything
weve ever seen before.

PKE Figuring out how these people
got there may shed some light

on the nature
of the signals themselves.

Whos best suited to come
with us to the surface, Burnham?

BRN Lieutenant Owosekun.

She grew up in a Luddite
collective on Earth.

She'll know how to embed,
per General Order 1.

PKE Brief her and lets move.

COMP Your personal shielding
is phase-locked

with the gravity simulator.

Any change in this gravimetric
stability will result in...

TLY Boom.

COMP Confirmed.

TLY As theorized, there are
periodic concentrations of

metreon particles.

Yeah. Here looks promising.

Okeydokey.

Activating laser core sampler

and corresponding
internal artificial grav.

And according
to my calculations,

one cubic centimeter of

metreon-charged asteroid
weighs in

at a portly
one point five metric tons.

COMP Metreon fluctuation detected.

TLY Adjust grav sim.

COMP Project termination advised.

TLY Not yet.

Metreon-charged dark matter
is our only lead

in finding
a new spore-drive interface,

and Commander Stamets
needs this.

Got it.

Secure sample.

Hello, gorgeous.

COMP Alert. Energy discharge

of unknown origin detected
in main shuttle bay. Engineer...

BRN No life signs inside.

PKE Set phasers to stun.

Keep em handy
but out of sight.

Have either of you ever been
in a church?

OWO No. My family are

non-believers.

BRN Im familiar with the
texts of Earths religions.

PKE All right.
Lets find out

who these people are and why
theyre calling for help.

BRN This glass is two centuries old.

It represents
not just Christianity, but

Judaism, Islam, Hinduism,
Buddhism,

Shinto and Wicca.

OWO The distress call is
coming from beneath us.

Ill look for
the basement.

PKE "For those
who live the old way burn.

BRN "Those who

sin against us shall be cut down
by our gods."

Thats light and welcoming.

"When those who believe
in our signs come to thee,

say, Peace be upon you."

Anthropologically speaking,

it appears that
they cobbled together a religion

based on the primary faiths
of Earth.

PKE This book is some sort
of new scripture.

BRN It might be their historical
record. Ill scan the text.

PKE Or we could look
at the pictures.

That was the original purpose
for a window like this.

To teach the gospel
to those who couldnt read.

JAC Why arent you in the fields?

PKE Were not from here.

Uh, my name is Christopher.

This is Michael and Joanne.

JAC Is this your first time
in New Eden?

PKE Yes.

Were from the north.

JAC The All-Mother

will want to see you.

VILL We welcome our new friends
from the northern territory

and pledge gratitude
to our Creators

for their love and deliverance
to New Eden

on our planet Terralysium.

WOMAN Tonight, on the harvest moon,
we remember

that over 200 years ago,
in 2053,

the First Saved, soldiers
and civilians among them,

took cover in the white church

from the devastation
of World War III.

Jets overhead
dropped nuclear bombs.

Our ancestors knew
death was coming,

but just before
the explosions,

an angel appeared to them,

surrounded by pillars

of fire,
and delivered our church

and those taking shelter in it

here to Terralysium.

They awoke here
and founded New Eden.

But who should they
thank for this salvation?

Which God?

There were so many
faiths among them,

how would they solve
such a quandary?

PKE By combining all religions
into one.

BRN Say my religion is science.

Has anyone used it
to find an alternate answer

to how our ancestors got here?

JAC How, without the proper
technology?

WOMAN All weve got are
decaying relics

that came with
the First Saved.

For years,
Jacob and Rose

have tried to get
the church lights back on.

Since the battery units died,
and the windows went dark,

pilgrimages to our shrine
have dwindled.

BRN Still, there must be
some rational theories

about how the church
was transported here.

JAC A camera attached
to a soldiers helmet exists

from that time, but

its broken.

WOMAN We have no
need for proof.

We are guided by

the existence of something
greater than ourselves-

our faith.

PKE Its getting late.

Were setting out
early tomorrow.

Would you mind if we take
shelter in your church?

WOMAN Of course not.

PKE Thank you for the fellowship.

WOMAN Peace be with you.

PKE And also with you.

MAY Tilly?

Tilly, wake up.

TLY What? Where am I?

MAYY Dont worry.

Theyre helping you.

I was there when
you got hurt.

It was so scary.
I thought I lost you.

Oh, you shouldnt
do that. Oh, no.

Help!
PART THREE 
TLY Whats going on?

SAR Ensign
Tilly, dissecting

a highly unstable interstellar
asteroid by yourself?

This lapse in judgment
put your shipmates at risk

and nearly got you killed.

Will you corroborate
that, Dr. Pollard?

POL Hes correct.
Almost dead. You.

But youre gonna be okay.

TLY Sorry, sir. I was trying
to help Commander Stamets.

SAR I do not see how one
leads to the other.

TLY I took an asteroid sample
in the hopes

that I could design
a coherent resonator

to work with the spores instead.

Essentially building

a dark-matter
navigational interface

so that Commander Stamets
will no longer have

to interface with
the spore drive?

SAR Before we can care for others,
we must care for ourselves.

TLY Has this jeopardized
my placement

in the Command Training Program?

SAR It has not, as long as
it is not an indicator

of more reckless behavior.

You are the youngest candidate
ever accepted into the CTP.

Being the only
Kelpien in Starfleet,

I know how it feels to
want to prove your worth.

I was so determined to be
a good example of my race,

I learned 90 different
Federation languages.

TLY Fluently?

SAR My point is,

I put an inordinate
amount of responsibility

on these slender shoulders,
often to my detriment.

I expect you

to take better care.

You are important.

RHYS Mr. Saru

to the bridge immediately.

SAR Report.

RHYS Sensors detecting
a massive spike

of ionizing radiation
in the upper atmosphere.

DET Theres been a disruption
in the gravitational stability

of the planets outermost ring.

SAR This could relate
to the signals.

DET Radioactive particles
from the ring are on the way

to the planets surface.

SAR Levels?

DET Bad.

SAR Bad?

DET Really bad. In 64 minutes,

the radiation will reach
the upper atmosphere, causing...

an extinction level event.

SAR Um...

tell transporters

to stand by.

Bryce, please contact
the captain.

BRY Not possible, sir.

The radiations interfering
with our communication.

ARIM We wont be able
to transport either.

DET Shall I send a shuttle
to get them, sir?

STA No. The shuttles
ionized carbon exhaust

will create a runaway
positive feedback loop

that will accelerate
the particles arrival.

I heard there was a problem.

SAR Happy to have you,
as always, Mr. Stamets,

especially now.

STA Its highly unlikely

that they can see the outer ring
from the planets surface.

Theyll never know
whats coming until it hits.

SAR Time?
DET 62 minutes

before nuclear winter
becomes irreversible.

SAR If we were

brought here,

perhaps this is why.

We are responsible

not only to our landing party

but to every living being
on that planet.

Discovery

will not allow
a catastrophe on her watch.

Clock is ticking.

Let us get to work.

PKE Clearly, that distress
beacon has been broadcasting

without these people
even knowing it.

Well turn it off so
no one else disturbs this place

and then beam out.

OWO I isolated
the distress beacon signal.

Its coming from down here.

PKE Lets hope
that helmet cameras here, too.

BRN Im sorry, sir.

You cant be suggesting
that we leave them here.

PKE Find that
beacon, please,

Owosekun.

BRN Before we
transported down,

you said you had a hunch

the signal we were following was
leading us to a rescue mission.

PKE No one needs rescuing, Burnham.

This place

really is a new Eden.

BRN Amesha and the others
are kin to us.

They deserve to be reintegrated
into modern society.

PKE By their own account,
they left Earth in 2053.

They did not use a starship.
That makes them pre-warp,

subject to General Order 1.

We cannot interfere
with their natural development.

BRN But they believe Earth and
the human race were destroyed.

Theyre wrong.

Worse, the faith
they cling to is a lie.

PKE Can you prove that?

BRN What I will prove

is that none of this happened
because of some miracle.

OWO Got it!

The batterys dead,

but...

This is strange.

Someone jury-rigged it
to continue transmitting

the distress call.

JAC And you answered.

There were scientists
among the First Saved, too.

My family. For generations,
we tended to that beacon.

No one else knew it was
here, and you found it

with that incredible device.

My ancestors were right,
werent they?

The Earth
wasnt destroyed.

Mankind evolved.

PKE Jacob...

...this-this device,
this has- its always been

in my family.
Its for navigation.

JAC Since the other day,

when the red burst appeared in
the sky, I knew you were coming.

That was the light
from your ship, right?

Your hands,
your skin,

unravaged by the labor
we do here.

Youre not from
Terralysium.

I can see the truth
in your eyes.

PKE Jacob, listen to me.

You are mistaken.

JAC No, Im not.

I have been waiting for
this day for a long time.

For our true salvation.

PKE Lets go.

Were sorry for trespassing.

JAC No, wait, wait, no.
Dont go. Wait.

Wait! Stop!

OWO Ah. Its locked.

If its just a slide bolt,

I can use a magnet
to get us out.

BRN Our utility bags are gone.

Jacob must have taken
all of our tech.

PKE To prove his case
to the others, no doubt.

OWO Ah-ha. Got it.

Yep. I can feel it...

PKE God or no God, we are still
bound by General Order 1.

You will not break cover
under any circumstances.

Do you both understand?

BRN Yes, sir.
OWO Yes, sir.

TLY If "X" doesnt work, try "Y."

If "Y" doesnt work, try "Z."

If "Z" doesnt work,
try drowning your ineptitude

in a Risan mai tai.

Where the hell is Burnham?

I need her to, like, be here
and "yes and..." me.

MAY Can I help you with something?

TLY Yes. Yes, thank you.

Im-Im supposed to be
on bed rest,

but that is practically an
affront to my very existence,

cause the ships on high alert,

the captain, Burnham, Owo,

not to mention an entire planet,
might be nuked,

and that is not happening.

Why are you looking
at me like that?

Youre May, right?
Am I talking too fast?

Im problem solving.
Ive had espressos.

MAY In sickbay?

TLY Yeah.

MAY Lives are at stake.

Its always better to ask

for forgiveness than permission.

TLY Exactly. Ive been trying
to figure out a way

to stop the downflow
of radioactive debris,

and then it occurred to me
if we could target the source

of the debris...

MAY The ring itself.

TLY Yes.

Thank you. We could-
We could pull the debris

away from the planet.

And then, were alive.

And alive is optimal.

Ive been running models
using a tractor beam, but...

MAY Discovery

wouldnt
be able to generate

graviton beams powerful enough

to change the course
of the debris field.

TLY You read my mind.

MAY Your mind is so much fun.

If only there were

something on this ship
that could generate

a massive gravitational field.

TLY The asteroid. Dark matter.
In the shuttlebay.

Its-its-its...

A little, tiny piece of it
destroyed an entire table.

It was awesome.
Youre a genius.

MAY No, youre a genius.

ARIM The rings radioactive
wave will hit the planet

in four minutes, 32 seconds.

RHYS What if we throw all
auxiliary power to phasers?

Destroy the radioactive debris

before it reaches
the lower atmosphere.

ARIM That would only give it
a greater concentration.

TLY I got it!

I got it, I got it.

SAR Ensign Tilly, how many times
in a single day

must we have this conversation?

TLY No, no, please, please, sir,
just-just hear me out, okay?

The dark-matter asteroid,
all right, its massive.

And the more mass an object has,

the greater its
gravitational pull, right?

You-you know this.

Can I just, um, scooch in there?
Thank you. Yeah.

So, if we launch the dark-matter
asteroid from the shuttlebay

on just the right trajectory,

its gravity will pull
the radioactive debris

away from the planet like a,
uh, invisible magnet.

See?

DET For the asteroid
to exit at the correct angle,

I would have to execute
a sustained circular drift.

TLY A donut.

You would be doing
a donut in a starship.

DET Thats true.

SAR Is this possible?

DET Yes. Except no.

Wed have to launch the asteroid
from within the center

of the rings debris field.

There is no way I can
pilot us from in there.

STA I can.

We could jump.

SAR You have exactly

two minutes, 11 seconds
before the wave

of radioactive debris crosses
the point of no return.

Run, Mr. Stamets.

STA Tell Engineering to ready
the spore drive.

JAC The visitors are from
the first Earth.

They brought amazing things:

communication devices,

scientific-data collectors.

Look inside. Youll believe.

PART FOUR 

PKE What happened to
"Thou shalt not steal"?

JAC I just want her
to see the truth.

PKE The truth is that
he attacked us.

He violated everything
that the Faith holds dear.

You give us back what you took,

and well leave.

JAC Listen to me.

They came on a starship.

They can take us back home.

We can experience
the real Earth.

WOMAN This is your home.

You are living by the corrupt
way of the old Earth, Jacob.

JAC Youre the scientist.

Tell her Im right.

Look.

OWO Captain! No!

BRN No!

OWO Hes dying.

JAC Save him. With your technology,
I know you can.

BRN We-we need to get him
to the church

and pray for another
deliverance.

WOMAN Yes, okay.

STA Bridge, we are ready to jump.

SAR And are you ready, Lieutenant?

DET Had my pilots license
since 12, sir.

SAR Black alert.

Airiam... now.

Detmer!

DET Initiating donut maneuver, sir.

ARIM Its working, sir.

SAR Let us get our
landing party. Now.

JAC Wait, wait, no. Let me in!

WOMAN Jacob, no. Jacob!

The gods have answered
our prayer.

The angel returned
to save them.

ARIM Transport confirms
all are on board.

DET The asteroid successfully
diverted all the debris

from the planets atmosphere.

RHYS Yes!

SAR Perhaps you should

disobey my direct orders
more often, Ensign.

TLY No, I think your orders
are probably really good.

I need to pass out now.

SAR Do you need assistance?

TLY No, Im good. Im just...

straight to bed.

MAY Way to go, Stilly.

TLY Stilly?

Wait, are you...?

POL Welcome back, Captain.

You made it. But your ribs,

theyre gonna feel
like the xylophone

in a Klingon marching band.

Consider yourself
lucky to be alive.

Musk Junior High
School, Class of 2247.

TLY Signatures page.

Name: May something.

MAY Stilly, what the heck?

Youre moving again?

Its only been six months.

Youre the nicest person Ive
ever met at this awful school.

Ill miss our lunches.

They were like
little earthquakes.

"Bounce, bounce, bounce."

Please, stay in touch.
Love, May Ahearn.

TLY Ahearn.

Knew it.

Computer, locate quarters
for "Ahearn, May."

COMP Ships manifest
has no such name.

TLY Computer,
search Federation database

for the whereabouts
of "Ahearn, May,"

originally from San Francisco,
California, Earth.

COMP Working.
"Ahearn, May Theresa."

Born April 30, 2236.

Deceased June 9, 2252.

PKE Come.

BRN You wanted to see me?

PKE Yes. And dont make me laugh.

BRN Fortunately for you,
I was raised on Vulcan.

We dont do funny.

Maybe I should just shut up.

PKE I wanted to thank you

for following orders
and maintaining our cover

despite your captains
impairment.

And by impairment,

I-I mean having a phaser
go off in my chest.

BRN Well, sir,
I learned the hard way

what not following orders
can lead to.

In fact,

you asked earlier if there was
anything I ought to tell you.

There is, and I didnt.

The angelic being

they worship on Terralysium,
it appeared to me,

on the asteroid.

PKE Why didnt you say anything?

BRN I was injured.
I thought I was hallucinating.

PKE That cant be a coincidence.

Two signals,
two angel sightings.

BRN With all due respect, sir,
the word "angel"

does carry with it
certain implications.

I saw a form.

It hovered above me,
and it was...

to be completely honest,
quite beautiful.

But beyond that,

I wouldnt ascribe to it
divine properties.

PKE Those people in New Eden do.

And they would find
your experience

to be quite a revelation.

BRN Is that how you see it, sir?
As a revelation?

PKE At the very least,

this new information
creates more context.

And the context
can alter our perspective.

BRN Well, what about Jacob?

Isnt he entitled
to a little context?

He knows in his heart
who and what we are.

And we chose to lie to him.

We have the power
to help him solve a mystery

thats plagued his family
for 200 years.

We could alter
his

perspective.

PKE Look, I feel for the guy, too.

But even angels are no excuse
for violating General Order 1.

BRN Yeah, well, I have a better
excuse: his helmet camera.

Jacob said it recorded
whatever was in that church

the day they
were taken.

And as I see it, sir,
the urgency of our mission

directly contradicts
Starfleets first rule.

To serve one goal,
the other has to be sacrificed.

But thats a choice
only a captain can make.

PKE I lied.

To protect the others
from the truth.

The truth is...
you were right about us.

I-I know what its like
to live with doubt,

and I guess I-I didnt
want that for you.

JAC Howd you get here?

Beam of light?

PKE Yes, actually.

Its called a transporter.

It converts a-a person or an
object into an energy pattern,

then "beams" it to a target,

where its eventually
reconverted back into matter.

JAC Do you have a ship?

Do you, uh, fly among the stars?

PKE Yeah.

JAC And...

Earth?

PKE Well, were-were part

of a galactic federation now,

dedicated to peace, exploration
and protecting places

such as your planet.

Jacob,

we cannot intervene.

Your society
has to evolve

in its own way.

JAC My entire family spent

their whole lives
hoping to get a confirmation

that what we believed was true.

And you...

gave me that answer.

Something none of
them ever got.

And that is enough for me.

Thank you.
Because of you,

were not lost anymore.

PKE How about this power cell,

with a very long lifespan,
in exchange

for a soldiers broken camera
circa 2053?

I hope we meet again, Jacob.

JAC I know we will.

PKE You might want to stand back.

Pike to

Discovery,
one to transport.

Okay...

MAN Were under attack!

Holed up inside. A few hundred
souls: men, women and children.

Wait...

Somethings happening...

Take cover! Protect the young!

Oh! Blinding light!

Oh, my gosh!
