PART ONE

PKE Energize.

NUM Teleporter incoming.

Captain.

PKE Welcome aboard

Discovery,
Number One.

The failures cascaded
through all our primaries.

NUM Helm, nav, both impulse
and warp drive. Chief Louvier

has an engineering team
working round the clock.

PKE I dont think

Enterprise

will
ever have a chief engineer

more in love with his ship.

NUM Apparently,
Enterprise

is the only ship

in the fleet
thats had any problems.

PKE You know, he warned me.

The damn
holographic comm system.

Tell Louvier to rip
out the entire system.

From now on well communicate

using good,
old-fashioned viewscreens.

Truth is I never liked
the holograms.

They look too much like ghosts.

He told you Id say that.

NUM No. I told him.

Cheeseburger. Fries.

Habanero sauce.

PKE You want to order
some lighter fluid with that?

NUM That goes with the shake.

PKE Sorry to keep you in Spacedock.

NUM Ive made use of
the time, Captain.

PKE Youve been looking into
the allegations against Spock.

NUM Its hard to comprehend,
let alone believe,

that he murdered three people

at the psychiatric
facility on Starbase Five.

PKE Hows the crew taking it?

NUM They dont know the details.

Only that hes in trouble.

PKE Theres something else.

Tell me.

NUM Starfleets classified
his case Level One.

PKE Line officers dont usually
warrant that kind of scrutiny.

NU Its unprecedented. Which is why
Ive done a little digging.

PKE Sanctioned?

NUM Better you dont know the answer
to that.

PKE Before I look at that,

I need to know why you saw fit
to detour Federation protocols.

NUM Something about this
investigation isnt adding up.

Im not letting him go
without a fight.

PKE As usual, we agree.

MALE OFFICER Captain Pike to the ready room.

PKE Im late for a briefing.
Im glad you came.

Im sorry you cant stay longer.

NUM Next time.

Be careful, Captain.

PKE You, too, Number One.

STA We should give it a name.

Other than May.

I know it looks like a blob,

but this is one of the most
sophisticated life-forms

Ive ever encountered.

It has sentience,
intention.

Tilly, the mycelial network
doesnt just connect life.

It contains it.

Its an incubator.

TLY You mean, like,
um... like a home?

Ive been wondering why
it appeared to me as May,

which got me thinking
about the real May

that I met when I was, um, 14.

I was, um... I was a weird kid.

You know?
Like, not a lot of friends

and nobody who really
believed in me, including me.

But... she did.

She wanted to connect to
me, and she tried so hard.

But I dont really think

I was the friend to
her that she needed.

STA Im certain

you were much kinder than
you give yourself credit for.

You always are.

TLY Thank you, but...

I didnt even know she died.

I feel like I took her
for granted.

That girl
who thought I was special.

Oh!

BRN Ive cross-referenced
what were calling the Red Angel

with all known winged

and avian life-forms
in the Federation.

So far, Ive found nothing.

LINUS Sorry.

The universal translator
sometimes has trouble

reconfiguring my lingual
clicks and pops.

My answer to you was, "Nothing
in the known universe."

DET Which might suggest
its not a species.

Maybe one of a kind.

OWO A mutation.

RHYS Well, whatever it is,
figuring out how its connected

to these signals
will help us identify it.

NAHN If only we knew what it needs.

Commander Nhan, USS

Enterprise.

Glad to be here.

BRN Welcome back aboard.

SAR Could you pass the salt?

BRN Commander Saru,

can you shed any light?

SAR My apologies.

I woke up this morning fighting

an acute rhinovirus.

OWO So you have a cold.

LINUS I had a cold last week,
which sucked.

Saurian. Six nasal canals.

SAR It happens to the best of us,
Linus.

PKE Everyone to your stations.
Detmer, set a course

for 108 mark four.
Maximum warp.

DET Aye, sir.

PKE Mr. Saru, you look like hell.

Youve been burning the candle
at both ends lately.

Go get some rest.

SAR As you wish, sir.

PKE Burnham. A word.

BRN I understand your first officer
is on her way to Spacedock.

Was her visit informative?

PKE Number One is very resourceful.

People have a tendency
to end up owing her favors.

She uncovered

some classified information

on Starbase Five.

That is the warp signature
of the shuttle

that Spock stole
from the psychiatric facility.

I put us on an intercept course.

We should reach his position
in the next few hours.

BRN S-Sir,

after everything
thats happened,

I need to excuse myself
from seeing Spock.

PKE Not sure I follow.

BRN I dont want
to make things worse for him.

Hes a fugitive,
whatever the circumstances.

And as Amanda suggested...

Im probably the last person

who should insert themselves
into this problem.

PKE I disagree.

BRN He is lost, Captain.

You are better suited
to help him.

Ive thought this through.

Please, trust me.

PKE My abiding trust in you

doesnt eclipse
the mission at hand.

Facing whatever happened
to Spock,

its not gonna be easy
for any of us.

Reaching him
has to be the priority.

Detmer, status?

DET Something has grabbed us
out of warp, sir.

Speed dropping to sub-light.

Helm going unresponsive.

PKE Shields up.

Red alert. Owosekun,

are we talking tractor beam?

OWO More powerful than that, sir.

Im unable to raise shields.

BRN Preliminary analysis indicates
a multiphasic stasis field.

Its disrupting
our shield harmonics.

DET Were at
a full stop, sir.

Whatever has us,
w-were locked into place.

PKE Like a damn fly in a web.

BRN And there is the spider.

Starfleet has never
encountered anything like it.

565 kilometers in diameter

with a mass of 6.39 x 10 to
the 20th power kilograms.

It melds organic and
nonliving matter.

Its also ancient.

Initial scans put it
at 100,000 years old.

"Organic"?

PKE Are you saying its
some kind of a life-form?

Maybe it is a damn spider.
I hate spiders.

BRN It is premature to assign

any anthropomorphic
distinction or intent.

As of yet, it hasnt
responded to any hails.

But there is this.

The sphere is vibrating.

The computer extrapolated
what it might sound like

based on the surrounding
ambient radiation.

PKE Well, it has my ship,

and I dont know what
in the hell it wants.

Communicate with it or
disable it. And quickly, please.

BRN *speaking Klingon* I understand the stakes. 
*speaking Klingon* We're working as fast as we can. 
PKE *speaking French *Why are you speaking Klingon?

DET *speaking Andorian* I can't read my console. Is this Arabic? 
OWO *speaking Norwegian* My consoles have gone crazy. I can't read anything. 
PKE *speaking German* Kill Those Alarms. Someone tell me what happened? 
NAHN *speaking Italian* Universal Translators must be malfunctioning. 
BRY *speaking Welsch* Captain Pike, the sphere answered our hail... and then this happened. *imitates explosion* 
BRN *speaking Japanese* Anyone have any ideas? 
(comm chimes)
BRN Saru. 
PKE *speaking Hebrew* Welcome to the Tower of Babel. 
BRN *speaking Mandarin* You know more languages than anyone on this ship. 
SAR *speaking Mandarin* Yes. Nintey-four. 
BRN *speaking Spanish* The Universal Translator's been invaded by a virus. 
BRN *speaking Spanish* It's translating everything into a different language. 
SAR *speaking Spanish* I have eyes and ears, Burnham.
SAR *speaking Wolof* Computer, maintain helm stability, at one-hundred-forty-eight degrees off axis. 
COMP *speaking Wolof* Confirmed. 
(COMP speaking in overlapping languages)
(COMP speaking in multple languages at once)

SAR Captain Pike.

PKE Saru.

COMP Confirmed.

PKE Did it work?

BRN Yes. I can understand you.

DET I still cant
read my controls.

I think this is Tau Cetian.

SAR Am I the only one who bothered
to learn a foreign language?

I have localized

the backup bridge translator.

For the time being,

everyone who speaks
Earth English can communicate.

BRN The rest of the crew and
Discoverys

computer
are another matter.

The bridge may be temporarily
fixed, but the virus will continue

spreading through
our comms system.

I can try purging it

from the translators
main interface.

PKE We have to be able to talk
to the computer

and the rest of the crew
to have any chance

of breaking free
from that sphere. Do it.

BRN Yes, sir.

Ill go. You should stay
and monitor bridge stations.

SAR I have placed all systems
on... automatic.

And given
our current circumstances,

you will need a translator
just to operate the turbolift.

BRN Are you sure you can do this?

SAR We are wasting time.

TLY Weve run
a full diagnostic, Captain,

and this section
remains unaffected by the virus.

I will update you
if anything changes.

PKE Thank you, Ensign.

If we cant fly this thing,
Commander,

we may have to jump away.

PART TWO

STA The spore drive
will be ready, sir.

Bring the drive online,

and then well couple
the shunts to me,

in case weve got
to skedaddle.

JET ♪ Da, da, da,
da, da, da. ♪

The universal translator
for this section is

no más.

STA Can I... help you?

JET Uh, unless you can reroute
the plasma regulator

to silo off the relay
junction, then,

uh, no.

TLY Youre, um...?

JET Jett Reno, from the

Hiawatha.

I hitched a ride
off that asteroid.

Chief engineer sent me
to firewall off

the critical
propulsion systems.

I didnt realize a greenhouse

could be "critical"
or

"propulsive,"

but, hmm, what do I know?

Im just a gearhead,
not a farmer.

STA A... farmer.

Oh, please, let us know
what you think, because we care.

JET You should.
Antimatter and dilithium

might be old-school,
but they dont let you down.

STA Why soar when you can crawl?

JET You dont know me, Doc.
Im un-insultable.

Especially by a guy
who thinks he can run a ship

on mushrooms
that I pick off my pizza.

STA Spores are clean, renewable.

JET Yeah, do they come
with house dressing?

STA Do you have any idea
how many planets

have been ruined
by dilithium mining?

How many battles
were fought

to corner its supply?
Of course you dont.

Youre one of those people
who never even consider it.

JET And youre one of those people
that does the ha-ha jokey thing

and then gets all huffy
and in high dudgeon

when you cant think
of a comeback.

Do you have gum?

TLY Grape. I...

STA You know, it was only a
couple centuries ago that

the Earth nearly choked
to death on pollution.

Then we all woke up,
and within a generation,

everything from a
truck to a toaster...

TLY Do you want...
Sorry. Sorry

STA ...was covered
in solar panels.

Yesterdays solar panels
are todays fungi.

JET Hmm.
I can fix stuff

with duct tape,
if you want.

TLY Do you think May had anything
to do with the sphere?

STA What a giant entity
from our universe

and a mycelial species
from the network?

Well, they have
as much in common

as me and that grease monkey.

JET I could fix that analogy
with duct tape, too.

BRN *speaking Russian* I've isolated the communication system. 
Ready to Reinitalize? 
SAR *speaking Russian* Entering the reinitialization sequence. 
Sar *speaking Russian* Now 
BRN Burnham to bridge.
The universal translator

is back up and running ship-wide
on all systems.

Saru! What is going on?

This is not just a cold.

SAR No, it is not.

TLY Whats that hum?

JET Get down!

Okay, theres more
where that came from.

Weve got a hundred-
giga-electron volts

surging through
the local relays.

Computers isolated
the compartment

in order to contain the damage.

STA Weve still got
our life support.

JET Yeah, but...
it could kill us.

If our oxygen ignites,
well cook like french fries.

TLY Well, we could divert
the power to act like a...

a-a lightning arrestor.

JET We could use
the door

as a ground.

Then the surge would
dissipate through the frame

of the ship.
The question is,

how do we conduct the surge
from there to there?

STA No, a gas could,
once it ionizes.

I infuse the spores
with an argon-xenon mixture

to slow decay.

We could link up
the canisters

to contain the gas,
our version of a lightning rod.

JET Thats actually
not a stupid idea.

STA Its my version
of the house dressing,

but it saves your life.
Huh.

BRN Bridge. What happened?

Did the sphere fire on us?

OWO Negative.

EPS conduits are overloading.

Systems are going haywire.

The virus is spreading.

SAR What is happening
to the ship?

We... have to get
to the bridge.

BRN No, no, no, no, no.

Right now
we got to get you to sickbay.

JET Gas her up.

STA Gas transference at 100%.

TLY Youre gonna do that manually?

JET Uh, yeah,
cause obviously youre not.

Flick the switch.

(JET screams)
STA Are you okay?

TLY I feel like
Ive been hit by lightning

for the second time this week.

Reno?

Reno? Reno, are
you all right?

JET Weird... dream.

I was playing drums for Prince,

and there were doves
and a parade.

STA Okeydoke.

Wait.

Its gone.

STA Tilly!

TLY She wont let...

she wont let go!

She wont let go.

BRN Whats happening to him?
BRN Im hoping Dr.
Pollard can tell us.

PKE Well, comms is down, so I need
to see what the situation is

in sickbay, anyway.

POL Triage plasma burns
on level one.

Send non-critical
to sickbay two.

PKE Doctor.

POL Bring him here.

Elevated heart rate,

spiking adrenal levels,

increased
neural activity.

The pain would render the
average humanoid unconscious.

What do we do
about those?

SAR Nothing.
It is an effect of...

my condition.

POL Ocular discomfort?

SAR No. Kelpiens can see
far deeper

into th-the light spectrum
than humans.

I keep seeing flashes
of ultraviolet light,

invisible to you, but...
quite the opposite

for me.

POL Are these symptoms

common among Kelpiens?

SAR This is pointless.
And the ship is being

further immobilized
as we waste time.

There is no reason to believe
the sphere is benevolent.

Now, please...

PKE Commander.

Dr. Pollard is
trying to help you.

SAR Yes. It is unique
to my people,

and it is terminal.

BRN Are you certain?

SAR I have never been more certain
of anything in my life.

When I awoke

in discomfort this morning...

I hoped it was just...
a passing cold.

But now I have
to face the truth.

I do not understand why...

but I am beginning to think that

the sphere is...
is triggering

the Kelpien biological
process known as...

Vaharai.

It is the event that signals

when Kelpiens are ready to be...

culled for slaughter by...
the Baul,

the predator species
on my homeworld

of Kaminar.

PKE But there are
no Baul here.

SAR It does not matter.

Kelpien ganglia only enflame

in this manner...
as we near our end.

I am a...

a slave to my biology.

BRN We are not gonna let you die.

There has to be something

that we can do.

SAR There is not.

Kelpiens
undergoing

Vaharai

either die in the culling

or... are driven to madness
by the effects

of

Vaharai.
Either way,

death is inevitable.

STA The mycelial entity
has attached itself to Tilly.

Were trying to free her.
Engineering to bridge.

Engineering to bridge.
Come in.

Comms are down.

JET Along with most of the ship.

TLY Dont feel bad.

I know you have to
keep me in quarantine.

Or us.

I feel a
little weird.

I should...

I should be terrified,
but Im not.

May means me no harm.

STA Are you able to see May again?

How do you know this is benign?

TLY May was scary,
and she was clingy, and she,

like, never shut up, but...

she never hurt me.

She said she had a plan for me.

She said that I was
her only chance.

STA Did you ever think
she was manipulating you?

TLY Thats what she said

you

were
doing- she said that you...

you were trying to
poison me against her.

JET Okay, if that thing
wasnt freaking me out,

is.

STA The blob seems to be secreting
a psilocybin hallucinogen

to influence her emotions.

JET So youre saying

shes on a bad trip?

STA Or maybe its just trying

to calm her down
so she wont be scared.

JET Or so she wont fight back?

BRN If Saru thinks
that somehow the...

the sphere
triggered

Vaharai,

maybe escaping its grip would
stop whats happening to him.

PKE The problem is
freeing ourselves

before it
destroys the ship.

BRN If it wanted to destroy us,
why the slow attack?

Its inefficient, right?

It must need something.

PKE Its taking what it needs.
Without the computer,

all our primary systems begin to
fail, including the warp core.

The EPS grids unstable,
and its cutting off

entire sections,
including Engineering.

POL Life supports down to 60%,
but whos counting?

BRN It is not logical
for a virus to kill its host.

POL Youre attaching a known medical
diagnosis to an unknown entity.

SAR There may
be a way to...

slow the virus.

If we can analyze
its properties,

we may be able to develop
digital antibodies.

PKE That could give us back enough
control to break the ship free.

SAR In theory,
but it will be

a slow process, like...

army ants eating
a water buffalo.

BRN Im on it.
Going to the science lab.

SAR You will need my help.

PKE Saru, Commander Burnham
can handle this.

Theres no reason to risk
your health any further.

SAR I...

am dying, Captain...

but I am most
certainly not... dead.

The antibodies

are s-slowing
the viruss progress.

Life support at 47%.

You are wondering
why I kept this from you.

BRN You dont have
to bear it alone.

SAR How...

do I explain...

to the woman
who has fought

over and over for the right
to take her next breath

that I come from a race
that submits?

BRN Im your friend.

There will never be
judgment between us.

SAR Well, to my shame...

hiding is my nature.

I have learned
multiple languages,

yet never shared my own,

fearful of revealing
my own...

alienness.

May I...

request a favor?

BRN Of course.

Anything.

SAR I have kept
detailed personal logs

since joining Starfleet.

I would ask you...

to officially catalogue them,
so that when...

General Order 1 no longer
applies to the Kelpiens...

they will know
a journey like mine...

is possible.

BRN It would be my privilege.

Did you record your life
before Starfleet?

SAR Uh, you might say
my life began

when I was granted refugee
status by the Federation.

While being processed
at Starbase Seven...

...I saw for the first time

life-forms
from across the universe,

some with less than I had,

yet, with a dream

of something better.

I listened.

Every story I heard...

...created... a space inside me

to feel more, to...

love

more.

I joined Starfleet

to help those in need

the way I was helped.

BRN You are...

the most

empathic

soul...

I know.

SAR There was just one...

painful caveat to my signing up.

I could never return home.

BRN Why?

SAR Oh.

More flashes
of ultraviolet light.

They are... growing

in... strength and frequency.

BRN Ill get something from sickbay.

SAR No. No.

I will be fine.

The captain asked you

to return to the bridge
as soon as possible.

BRN I can continue
the work here.

PART THREE

OWO Spock is still
at maximum warp, Captain.

If were stuck here much longer,
were going to lose him.

PKE Reallocate power
from the transporters

to long-range sensors.

I dont want to lose contact
with his shuttle.

OWO Even with sensors at max,
we wont be able

to track him for much longer.

PKE Contact Engineering.

See if they can reroute
impulse power to the deflectors.

If we can raise shields,
we might be able

to disrupt the stasis field
just enough to break free.

If so, can we
jump away?

ARIM Negative, sir.
We dont have enough power

to create the necessary
hull cavitation.

BRY Comms are still down
in Engineering, sir.

NAHN Security protocols
are also malfunctioning,

locking off parts
of the ship.

PKE How are we doing, Commander?

BRN The digital antibodies
are doing their job,

but progress is sluggish.

PKE Im running out of options.

If we lose Spock, we lose
any chance of protecting him.

BRN Permission to go to Engineering.

We cant talk to
them here, but maybe

I can help them
get power to shields.

PKE Permission granted.

(Tilly painting)
BRN Whats wrong?

STA The doors wont open,

and that thing reattached
itself to Tilly.

BRN Can you detach it?

JET I could cut it off. She wouldnt
even lose a freckle.

STA Bad idea.

If its a symbiote,
removing it might kill her.

JET Well, thanks for stopping by.

BRN I came to see if we can find a
way to boost power to shields.

STA No. With the systems
fluctuating,

this section is partitioned off.

We cant get to the warp core.

TLY Michael...

I feel really tired.

BRN What is happening?

STA That blob is sending her

in and out of consciousness.

BRN Why is it doing that to her?

JET Its not like we can ask it.

STA Actually, we can.

This is a harmonic interface.

It-it links my neurons
to the mycelial network.

With modification,

it could link May to Tillys
central nervous system.

Let May speak
using Tillys mouth.

BRN Wait. What did you say?

STA Were gonna talk to it.

BRN We need it to tell
us what it wants.

So do we.

The sphere- its been trying
to tell us something,

and we havent been listening.

JET Well, damn, woman, go!

STA We got her.

BRN Saru,

could the sphere be
trying to talk to us?

Using the virus as a way
to make first contact?

SAR Yeah. Yes, of course.
Ive been so blind.

The ultraviolet wavelengths
are repeating, like...

like letters would in...

in a sentence...
everywhere.

BRN Okay, Saru. Saru, stop.
Youre hurting yourself.

SAR No, no. No.

You called me
an "empathic soul,"

and it is true.
My ganglia

respond to shifts
in my environment,

like an early-warning system.

So it is... it is no coincidence

that I started feeling sick
just before...

the sphere engaged us.

BRN Why would...?

SAR I know what it is trying to say.

Not first contact, Burnham.

Last

contact.

I think it came to us to die.

STA May?

TLY Still me.

JET Signals piss-poor.

We need to
amplify it.

Cortical implant.

STA What, youre talking
about trepanation?

JET Drilling a hole in her skull?
Yeah.

STA Are you gonna fix her up
with duct tape after?

JET Maybe.
TLY Commander?

I think shes right.

And I think you think that, too.

STA Then we do this together.

JET This is all I had
laying around.

Please tell me
you have a laser scalpel.

STA No. Were gonna do this
old-school.

We need to sterilize
that drill bit.

First aid kits over there.

DET I was able
to raise shields.

Weve gained some
ground, but were still

being held by
the stasis field.

OWO Power levels coming
and going, Captain.

NAHN Security reports two dozen crew
still trapped below deck.

Life support failing.

RHYS Im reading an energy buildup
from inside the sphere.

Spiking 10,000 degrees
Kelvin and rising.

PKE Is it powering up weapons?

RHYS Reading no
identifiable weapons,

but its internal temperature
is now 20,000 degrees Kelvin.

PKE Divert all non-essential power
to weapons.

Lock on that things
radial axis and prepare

to fire photon torpedoes
on my order.

RHYS Aye, sir. Arming torpedoes.

SAR Captain,
hold your fire.

I do not believe
the sphere means us any harm.

PKE All evidence to the contrary.

That things about
to destroy us.

BRN Its not destroying
us, Captain.

Its trying to
send us a message.

PKE We received its message.
Im about to send our reply.

SAR Captain, what if

Vaharai,
my death process,

was triggered because
the sphere is also dying?

PKE You want to run that
by me again?

SAR We Kelpiens have
a defining trait

hard-wired into our DNA:
empathy.

I can feel the sphere
reaching out,

trying to share something
before it expires.

BRN Sir, I trust Sarus feelings
implicitly.

That sphere didnt
come to attack us.

SAR Captain,

I believe I have discerned
its means of communication.

PKE Detmer,
status on Spocks shuttle?

DET Exits our sensor range
in six minutes.

Once we lose his
warp signature,

we wont be able
to reacquire it.

PKE Set an intercept course.

I want us hauling ass
the second we break free.

DET Aye, sir.

PKE Keep talking
and make it fast.

SAR What if the sphere

was not attacking
our universal translator,

but attempting
to teach us

its

language

because it wants
to be remembered,

to preserve its history

using

Discovery,

but it cannot unless
we power down and let it in?

PKE That thing snatched us out of
warp and almost gutted the ship.

What if we lower shields,

and thats exactly what it needs
to end us?

SAR Computer, adjust
viewscreen display

to ultraviolet.

That is the light pattern
I have been seeing

everywhere,
repeating again

and again, generated
by the spheres virus.

Computer, run the light pattern

through the universal
translator.

Captain, I believe
we are looking

at a multitude
of languages

so advanced,
and knowledge so vast

that it simply
overloaded our system.

BRN This sphere is
100,000 years old.

Imagine what it knows,
what its seen.

Captain, this falls
under

Discoverys

original mission
statement

as a science vessel.

PART FOUR 

STA Well, I'll be.

An amplified cortical implant.

Hey, kiddo.

Whats your favorite song?

TLY What?

STA Your favorite song-
sing it for me.

TLY ♪ Though Im past
one hundred thousand miles ♪

♪ Im feeling very still

♪ And I think my spaceship knows
which way to go ♪

STA ♪ Tell my wife
I love her very much ♪

TLY ♪ She knows.

STA May?

MAY You wanted to talk to me?

Here I am.

STA What do you want?
Who are you?

MAY Im from a species
known as the JahSepp.

We lived harmoniously until an
alien intruder began to arrive

at random intervals,

ravaging our ecosystem
irreparably.

STA So, you came for help
to rid your species

of a destructive alien presence?

MAY You

are the destructive
alien presence.

STA The-the... the jumps?

Discoverys

jumps?

MAY I broke through the
confines of the network

to reach you,
at great risk.

STA Risk? You infected
my friend.

You dont belong
inside of her.

MAY You fly the ship from within
the cube, I can reach you.

In Tilly, I found the memory
of May Ahearn, someone I knew

shed be sympathetic to,
if given a second chance.

Once she trusted May,
I planned to persuade her

to deliver my
message to you.

STA Oh, I can only ask
for your forgiveness.

I knew better.

I

know

better.

Ill do whatever it takes
to fix this.

All I ask is
that you let Tilly go.

MAY I cant.

I have other plans for her.

JET Wrong!

STA Oh. No!

Tilly!

BRN The spheres

internal temperature
is approaching

ten-to-the-sixth-power Kelvin
and rising.

RHYS Our weapons will just
disintegrate in that heat.

DET Solar temperatures.

SAR A sign of core collapse.

Captain, if we are correct,

once the transmission is
complete, the sphere can die

knowing that it will live on
after it is gone.

We can choose to fulfill
our part in its destiny,

or simply let it fade away
unremembered.

OWO Spocks shuttle is almost
out of sensor range, sir.

PKE Prepare to lower shields.

If this goes south,
overload the warp core

and eject it at the sphere
on my command.

Even at half the distance,
the blast will decimate it.

When it lets go, we divert
all power to shields

and try to ride the shock wave
to a safe distance.

NAHN Assuming it doesnt
vaporize us first.

PKE If theres even half a
chance youre correct,

Im bound by my
oath and conscience

not to let it
vanish forever.

Commanders,
take your stations.

Ill follow your lead.

SAR Lieutenant Detmer,
lower shields.

DET Aye, sir. Shields down.

SAR Bryce,

all channels open.
Owosekun,

divert all computing
resources to Communications.

OWO Yes, Commander.
Here goes nothing.

BRN Transmission is downloading.

All library computers

are processing
at 20% above maximum.

Whatever the sphere is saying,
were getting all of it.

How long until it blows?

OWO Seconds. Power

and energy levels
are off the chart.

PKE Detmer, can you put enough
distance between us in time?

DET Negative, sir. Were still being
locked by the stasis field.

BRN Transmission complete.

PKE Detmer, eject the warp core.

DET Computer controls
not responding, sir.

OWO Detonation confirmed.

PKE Hard astern. Full impulse now.

SAR Ah.

It is so beautiful.

The light is almost like...
music.

PKE Yes, it is.

Im at a loss as to how
were still alive to see it.

BRN The spheres stasis field
reversed polarity

a nanosecond
before detonation...

and pushed us clear.

Its final act was to save us

so we could tell its story.

STA Hand me the damn torch.

STA Tilly.

Breathe. Breathe, Tilly.

Breathe.

Breathe, breathe. Slow it down.

Breathe. Come on, youre okay.

Youre still you.

TLY *hyperventilating*

STA Tilly.

Slow. Shh.

Stamets to Burnham.
We got Tilly.

Shes okay.

SAR Now it is my turn.

Take me to my quarters, please.

I left home
with a handful of seeds.

BRN Is this from your homeworld?

SAR It is the blossom
that marks the...

the passing of seasons
on Kaminar.

Somewhere along the way,
I... I lost who I was.

So focused on being

the best Kelpien in Starfleet.

Defined by my rank

and uniform...

...until that is all I became.

BRN You are wrong.

Look at what
youve achieved.

You found yourself
among the stars.

You found your bravery.

Your strength.

Youve saved so
many lives, Saru.

Including mine.

SAR It is time.

In that first drawer,
you will find a Kelpien knife,

a keepsake I use
to prune my flowers.

I need you

to... to sever my ganglia

and end my suffering.

I need your help

so that I can die now,

peacefully,

before the pain and madness
overtakes me.

Thank you, Michael.

BRN Do we have to do this?

Is it truly inevitable?

SAR I am sorry.

I know how hard
this is for you.

How many people
youve already lost.

I would do it myself, but...

I am too weak.

BRN After all this time...

...after everything that we
have been through together...

...I realize now

that you are my family, Saru.

SAR I feel the same...

about you.

You are the only one
who knows me.

You replaced the sister I had
on Kaminar.

Siranna.

That knife was hers.

I left her

without so much as a good-bye.

You promise me-

no matter how frightening
or painful it may be-

promise me

you will

mend your relationship
with Spock.

If you and I can build
this type of bond,

Im certain
you can do the same with him.

Please.

BRN  I promise.

SAR Good-bye, Michael.

BRN I love you, Saru.

SAR Michael? What is wrong?

BRN I-I bare... I barely touched it.

They fell out
on their own.

SAR I... I, uh...

dont understand.

I should be...

POL Your vital signs
have returned to normal.

How are you feeling?

SAR I have never felt
this way before.

Fear has always been the
governing principle of my life.

But now...

it is gone.

More than that,
I feel...

...power.

My own power.

POL Well,

consider yourself certified
for duty, Commander.

SAR Despite speaking 94 languages,

there are times when
words are not enough.

BRN Initial reports

are coming in
from the science teams.

The sphere didnt just give us
its language.

We have recorded everything
it has seen and experienced

the last 100,000 years.

Its legacy.

And your legacy
has a new chapter.

SAR A new and deeply troubling one.

The Kelpien way of life

has always been oriented
toward death

and the role the
Baul play in it.

My people call it
"The Great Balance."

It is our central,
organizing truth.

BRN But you proved it wrong.

SAR Precisely.

And you asked me before
why I could not go home.

It is because I made a promise
to Captain Georgiou

to uphold General Order 1,

not to interfere
with the destiny of my species.

But now,

knowing that what my people
have accepted as the truth

is a lie?

What does this mean for us?

For my species?

My... my planet?

COMP The war between
the Quaternary star systems

and the Roquarri Imperium
lasted a solar cent...

BRN From the sphere?

PKE The computers translation.

Its like weve found
our galaxys Dead Sea Scrolls.

Federation scientists will be
studying this for centuries

thanks to you and Saru.

I hope it was worth the cost.

BRN Cost us nothing, sir.

I combed through the
spheres sensor records

and found the last
thing that it saw:

Spocks shuttle.

I was able to track it
beyond our sensor range.

PKE Conn,

Commander Burnham
is sending you

the coordinates
of Spocks shuttle.

Plot a course,
and dont spare the horses.

DET Aye, sir.

PKE From now on,

Ill work to keep you clear

about whatever happens
with your brother.

BRN Thank you, Captain, but I have
had a change of heart.

I cant abandon him.

No matter the mistakes
that Ive made,

I need my brother to know that
I will always be there for him.

No matter what.

STA We need to close the
door to the network.

Forever.

Just making
final calculations.

MAY Hi, hi. Hello? Hello? Its me.

TLY Did you see that?

See what?

May.

She was there,
and then she was gone.

STA Um...

...you might still be coming
down off your hallucinogen.

TLY No, I swear. I swear.

JET Yeah.

No, its natural to be paranoid

in your condition.

Something is not right.

Somethings not right.

MAY Hello?

Tilly. Hello?

Tilly. Hello, hello...

Wow.

STA Have you always been
a superior being?

MAY
Hi. Hello? Hello?

JET Because...

the harmonics
in your aura...

STA You know, I was thinking

the exact same thing
about your aura.

JET Whats that dust on your face?

STA ...dust on your face?

JET Its on yours, too.

STA ...yours, too.

JET That tastes like...

STA Psilocybin?

JET It dosed us. It dosed us.

STA Slap me really hard.

JET Whyd I do that?

STA To get me focused enough
to find the med kit.

I need to hit us both
with a shot of impedrizine

so we can come down.

STA Now I need to
give one to Tilly.

JET Wait a minute. Where is she?

STA Tilly?

Wait.

Oh, my God,
they took her.

No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

Tilly?

No!
