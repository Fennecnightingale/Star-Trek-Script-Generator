PART ONE 
PICARD See. And... raise.
DATA Hmm.
DATA Call.
DATA I will take two, please.
PICARD You have a tell.
DATA That is impossible, sir.
PICARD Every now and then, you dilate your left pupil, ostentatiously, I might add, in an effort to cheat me into thinking that
you have a tell.
PICARD But your true tell is you don't have one.
PICARD When your eyes are neutral, that's when I know you're bluffing.
DATA Mm. Now that you've told me that, Captain, I am confused about which deception to employ.
DATA Fifty.
PICARD Fifty?
PICARD That's everything I have.
DATA I can see that, Captain.
DATA Do you wish to call or fold?
PICARD Let's behave like civilized men.
PICARD Milk?
DATA No, thank you, sir.
PICARD Sugar?
DATA No, thank you, sir.
DATA Why are you stalling, Captain?
PICARD I don't want the game to end.
PICARD I'm all in.
PICARD Strange. I didn't know we were on course to Mars. This isn't right.
PICARD Oh, Number One. It's all right, boy.
PICARD Hey, it's all right.
PICARD It's all right.
DAHJ I love how they do that.
CALER So, what are we celebrating?
DAHJ Guess.
DAHJ Use those famous Xahean instincts.
CALER Okay. You have... a secret.
CALER A happy secret.
CALER No way.
DAHJ I got into Daystrom.
CALER Dahj!
CALER You're amazing.
DAHJ Thank you.
CALER Robotics or, uh...?
DAHJ Dude, I'm a fellow in
Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Consciousness.
CALER Wow, that's... That's pretty, that's pretty cool.
CALER Wow.
CALER I might even be able to sit with you in the cafeteria.
DAHJ Um, maybe. I don't know.
CALER No?
CALER More wine?
DAHJ Something better. Surprise me.
CALER Wines.
CALER Dahj, your replicator menus are tragic.
CALER Vanilla and... vanilla.
CALER Of course.
DAHJ No! No! No!
INTRUDER ONE Speak English!
INTRUDER TWO Where are the rest of you? Where are you from?
DAHJ I-I don't know...
INTRUDER TWO Where are you from?
DAHJ I'm from Seattle. I...
INTRUDER  THREE We can get it later. Knock her out.
DAHJ No, no!
INTRUDER  ONE She's activating!
INTRUDER ONE She's activ...
INTRUDER TWO Ah... Hmm.
PICARD Ah... I know you think you're bringing that in the house, but it's out of the question.
PICARD Don't pretend you don't speak French. We practiced.
ZHABAN Number One, what do you have?
PICARD You mean whom does he have.
LARIS Our little assassin.
PICARD Well, even assassins need a bath sometime.
ZHABAN Laris heard you talking in your sleep last night.
PICARD Did I say anything of interest?
LARIS No, you talked rubbish. But you're not sleeping. Bad dreams?
PICARD The dreams are lovely. It's the waking up that I'm beginning to resent.
LARIS Ah, no melancholy. Today's a big day. Now, go and get your breakfast.
PICARD You know, I am beginning to regret that I ever allowed myself to be talked into doing this.
ZHABAN He won't take breakfast from me.
PICARD Old dogs.
ZHABAN Which one?
PICARD Mm.
PICARD Tea. Earl Grey. Decaf.
ZHABAN So, are we all ready?
PICARD Oh, are you doing an interview as well, Zhaban?
PICARD You know, sometimes you talk to me as if I were a benign old codger.
LARIS "Codger"?
ZHABAN Somewhere between a coot and geezer, I believe.
ZHABAN Ooh, the first one just arrived.
LARIS Go and get dressed, Your Highness.
LARIS And don't forget to wash your hands.
LARIS Ten years, still have to remind you.
RICHTER Yeah. That's the one.Yeah. I like that.
ZHABAN Extremely dignified, sir.
PICARD Look at this knot. It's ridiculous.
ZHABAN Well, maybe. But I want to keep my job.
LARIS I know you're nervous.
PICARD I am not nervous.
LARIS The past is the past. Now. Much better.
PICARD Huh.
PICARD Yeah.
ZHABAN Oh, the drama.
PICARD You went over the terms with them?
ZHABAN Three times, sir.
ZHABAN She assured me she will not inquire about your separation from Starfleet.
LARIS Yeah. After so long, sometimes I worry you've forgotten what you did, who you are.
PICARD Laris, I...
LARIS We...have not.
LARIS Now go.
ZHABAN And, sir?
ZHABAN Be the captain they remember.
RICHTER While Captain of Starfleet's Flagship Enterprise, he was hailed as one of our galaxy's most intrepid explorers, a skilled diplomat, military strategist, humanitarian and author of many widely-praised works of historical analysis.
RICHTER He joins us on the anniversary of the Romulan supernova to discuss his role in those tragic events.
RICHTER I have the rare honor of introducing Admiral Jean-Luc Picard.
PICARD Retired.
RICHTER You've never agreed to an interview before, so thank you for inviting the galaxy into your study.
PICARD Oh, less crowded than I thought.
RICHTER Well... today is a solemn day.
PICARD It is a day of memories.
PICARD Raising awareness of the supernova's lingering impact is work that I am extremely passionate about.
RICHTER Let's explore that.
RICHTER When you first learned that the Romulan sun was going to explode and the terrible consequences that would bring, what feelings came up for you?
PICARD Oh, well, there are no words to describe the...calamitous scale of that change.
PICARD Which is one of the reasons...
RICHTER You can't tell us how you felt, but your initial actions were to call for a massive relocation of Romulans?
PICARD Well, the Romulans asked for our help, and I believed we had a profound obligation to give it.
RICHTER Many felt there were better uses for our resources than aiding the Federation's oldest enemy.
PICARD Well, fortunately, the Federation chose to support the rescue effort.
RICHTER Yes. Initially.
PICARD I have been known to be persuasive.
PICARD But the Federation understood there were millions of lives at stake.
RICHTER Romulan lives.
PICARD No. Lives.
RICHTER You left the Enterprise to command the rescue armada.
RICHTER 10,000 warp-capable ferries.
RICHTER A mission to relocate 900 million Romulan citizens to worlds outside the blast of the supernova.
RICHTER A logistical feat more ambitious than the pyramids.
PICARD The pyramids were a symbol of colossal vanity.
PICARD If you want to look for a historical analogy...
PICARD Dunkirk.
RICHTER Dunkirk.
PICARD Yes.
RICHTER And then the unimaginable happened. Can you tell us about that?
RICHTER Admiral?
PICARD I thought we were here to talk about the supernova.
RICHTER A group of rogue synthetics dropped the planetary defense shields and hacked Mars's own defense net.
PICARD Yes. 
RICHTER Wiping out the rescue armada and completely destroying the Utopia Planitia Shipyard.
RICHTER The explosions ignited the flammable vapors in the stratosphere.
RICHTER Mars remains on fire to this day.
RICHTER 92,143 lives were lost, which led to a ban on synthetics.
PICARD Yes.
PICARD We still don't know why the synthetics went rogue and did what they did that day, but I believe the subsequent decision to ban synthetic life-forms was a mistake.
RICHTER Lieutenant Commander Data, operations officer on the Enterprise, was synthetic.
RICHTER Did you ever lose faith in him?
PICARD Never.
RICHTER What was it that you lost faith in, Admiral?
RICHTER You've never spoken about your departure from Starfleet.
RICHTER Didn't you, in fact, resign your commission in protest?
RICHTER Tell us, Admiral.
RICHTER Why did you really quit Starfleet?
PICARD Because it was no longer Starfleet.
RICHTER I'm sorry?
PICARD Because it was no longer Starfleet!
PICARD We withdrew.
PICARD The galaxy was mourning, burying its dead, and Starfleet had slunk from its duties.
PICARD The decision to call off the rescue and to abandon those people we had sworn to save was not just dishonorable. It was downright criminal!
PICARD And I was not prepared to stand by and be a spectator.
PICARD And you, my dear, you have no idea what Dunkirk is, right?
PICARD You're a stranger to history. You're a stranger to war.
PICARD You just wave your hand and it all goes away.
PICARD Well, it's not so easy for those who died.
PICARD And it was not so easy for those who were left behind.
PICARD We're done here.
PICARD "There's no legacy as rich as honesty."
PICARD Who said that, Number One?
PART TWO 
PICARD What do you want here?
DAHJ I saw your interview.
DAHJ Do you know me?
PICARD What?
DAHJ Do you know me?
PICARD No.
DAHJ Look at me.
DAHJ You're not sure.
DAHJ You're not sure.
DAHJ How do I know that?
PICARD Who are you?
DAHJ I was with my boyfriend.
DAHJ We were in my apartment.
DAHJ They put a bag over my head. I couldn't see anything.
PICARD Who are "they"?
DAHJ I don't know, but my boyfriend...
DAHJ They murdered him.
DAHJ Then I killed them.
DAHJ All of them.
PICARD What?
DAHJ Something inside of me just knew what to do, how to move, how to fight.
DAHJ And somehow... It was like lightning... seeking the ground.
DAHJ And then I took the bag off.
DAHJ There was so much blood, so I just ran.
PICARD Shh.
DAHJ I didn't know where to go.
PICARD Shh. Please, try and calm yourself.
PICARD Shh. Try and calm yourself, okay?
DAHJ But in my mind, I kept seeing you.
DAHJ I kept seeing your face.
PICARD Me?
DAHJ Yes.
DAHJ I came because the same lightning that got me out of there alive led me here.
PICARD Why?
DAHJ Because everything inside of me says that I'm safe with you.
LARIS There you go.
LARIS Good as new.
DAHJ Thank you.
ZHABAN Here you are.
PICARD Earl Grey. Never fails.
LARIS We'll be in the kitchen.
PICARD That's an unusual necklace.
PICARD May I see?
PICARD Thank you.
DAHJ My father gave it to me.
PICARD Hmm. Lovely.
DAHJ Have you ever...?
PICARD Ever what?
DAHJ Been a stranger to yourself?
PICARD Many, many times.
PICARD Thank you.
PICARD May I ask your name?
DAHJ Dahj.
PICARD Dahj.
PICARD I'm Jean-Luc.
DAHJ I know.
DAHJ And not because of the interview or because you're the great man.
DAHJ I know you.
PICARD Well, I've spoken, lectured.
DAHJ No, it's...
DAHJ It's older.
DAHJ Deeper.
DAHJ Much, much deeper.
PICARD You may be right.
DAHJ Do you know how?
PICARD No.
DAHJ Do you think I'm crazy?
PICARD No.
DAHJ Do you believe me?
PICARD I believe that you believe that you're supposed to be here.
PICARD And if you were dangerous, then Number One would let me know.
PICARD Laris. Could you show our guest to a room?
PICARD I think she needs a good night's sleep.
LARIS Come on, dear. We'll get you set up.
DAHJ Thank you.
DATA Would you like to finish it, Captain?
PICARD I don't know how.
DATA That is not true, sir.
PICARD No.
PART THREE 
LARIS Excuse me, sir. The young woman has gone.
PICARD Where?
LARIS I was up at 5:00. Her door was open.
LARIS The dog was in her bed, but she was gone.
LARIS I-I checked the feeds. She's nowhere on the property.
PICARD There is somewhere I have to go.
PICARD If she returns, contact me immediately.
PICARD Everything in the quantum archive is locked in stasis, correct?
INDEX Correct.
PICARD And no one beside myself has access, correct?
INDEX Unless you prefer we sell tickets.
PICARD Is that humor?
INDEX We're trying something new.
PICARD Don't give up your day job.
INDEX My program offers you privacy beyond this point.
INDEX If you need me again, just say "Index."
PICARD Index. Identify this painting.
INDEX Item 227.67.
INDEX Archives of Jean-Luc Picard, admiral, retired.
INDEX An oil on canvas painted by Commander Data, circa 2369.
INDEX One of a set of two.
INDEX He gifted it to you on the Enterprise.
INDEX The other is hanging on your study wall at home, I believe.
PICARD And no one else has been in here?
PICARD Not even for servicing?
PICARD Check the records.
INDEX No one, Admiral.
PICARD This painting had a title.
INDEX Accessing.
INDEX This painting is called "Daughter."
DAHJ'S MOM Hi, honey.
DAHJ Mom, someone tried to kill me.
DAHJ'S MOM What? Honey, wh-who? Wha...
DAHJ I'm...
DAHJ I just ran. I think they're still after me.
DAHJ I don't know what's happening, Mom.
DAHJ'S MOM  Dahj, you need to get somewhere safe.
DAHJ Mom, I tried, but-but I couldn't stay there.
DAHJ I-I can't put anyone else in danger.
DAHJ I don't want anyone else to get hurt, Mom.
DAHJ Mom, I'm so scared.
DAHJ'S MOM Honey, this is important.
DAHJ'S MOM You have to go back to Picard.
DAHJ No, no, it's too dangerous for him. It...
DAHJ Wait.
DAHJ Wait, I-I didn't tell you that I went to Picard.
DAHJ'S MOM Of course you did, sweetie.
DAHJ'S MOM How else would I know?
DAHJ Mom, I haven't spoken to you since it happened.
DAHJ What's happening?
DAHJ'S MOM Baby, please.
DAHJ'S MOM Find Picard. He can help you.
DAHJ'S MOM He will help you.
DAHJ'S MOM Just close your eyes and focus.
DAHJ'S MOM Think clearly, Dahj.
DAHJ'S MOM Clearly, Dahj.
DAHJ'S MOM Now find Picard again.
DAHJ'S MOM Go.
PICARD Dahj?
PICARD How did you know I was here?
PICARD I was so very worried when I found you'd gone.
DAHJ I was afraid that they would come, that you would be in danger.
DAHJ I knew how to track you here.
DAHJ I-I know stuff now.
DAHJ I can hear conversations a block away.
PICARD Come. Let's get away from here.
DAHJ So I did some research. I may have schizophrenia.
DAHJ Or maybe I had head trauma. The auditory hallucinations...
PICARD No, you don't have schizophrenia.
DAHJ Then I'm a freak.
PICARD In fact, you might be very special.
PICARD I had a dear friend.
PICARD Commander Data.
PICARD He was an android.
DAHJ Like the ones who attacked Mars?
PICARD No, no. Not at all. The word "android" conjures up all kinds of things for people.
PICARD Forget them.
PICARD Commander Data was a highly decorated Starfleet officer.
PICARD And... he sacrificed his life for me.
PICARD On our last mission together.
PICARD It was over two decades ago now.
PICARD But he was also an artist.
PICARD A painter.
DAHJ Why are you telling me this?
PICARD Because, Dahj, he painted you.
PICARD Exactly as you are here and now.
PICARD But he painted it 30 years ago.
DAHJ That's impossible.
PICARD He named the painting "Daughter."
DAHJ Okay, look, your friend painted someone, but...
PICARD You said it was like lightning seeking the ground, in your apartment.
PICARD You knew what to do even though you'd never done it before.
DAHJ Adrenaline.
PICARD And you knew they were coming after you.
PICARD And the hearing.
PICARD And y-you tracked me.
PICARD How did you track me?
PICARD Tracking me requires...
DAHJ I just...
PICARD ...a security clearance, which you don't have.
PICARD I think the attack on you might have acted as some kind of wake-up call.
PICARD Like a positronic alarm bell.
DAHJ No.
DAHJ No, I was born in Seattle.
DAHJ My dad was a xenobotanist.
DAHJ And our house was full of orchids.
DAHJ He spliced two genuses and he named the offspring after me.
DAHJ Orchidaceae Dahj oncidium.
DAHJ Yellow and pink.
PICARD That's a beautiful memory.
PICARD And it's yours.
PICARD No one can touch it or take it away.
PICARD But... you must look inside, deeply and honestly.
PICARD Have you ever considered the possibility...
DAHJ That I'm a soulless murder machine?
PICARD That you are something lovingly and deliberately created.
PICARD Like Dahj oncidium.
DAHJ You're telling me that I'm not real.
PICARD No, I'm not.
PICARD If you are who I think you are... you are dear to me in ways that you can't understand.
PICARD I will never leave you.
PICARD We will go together to the Daystrom Institute in Okinawa.
DAHJ I was just accepted at Daystrom as a research fellow.
PICARD You were? That's brilliant.
DAHJ That doesn't mean anything anymore.
PICARD If I'm right, it means that you are the daughter of a man who was all meaning, all courage.
PICARD Be like him.
DAHJ They found us. Move, now.Oh.
PICARD Dahj, wait. We need help.
DAHJ They're almost here.
PICARD Dahj, stop. Wait.
DAHJ No, there's no time.
PICARD Oh.
DAHJ Stay down!
PICARD No!
PART FOUR 
DATA Would you like to finish it, Captain?
PICARD I will never leave you.
RICHTER Why did you really quit Starfleet?
INDEX This painting is called "Daughter."
LARIS He's awake.
PICARD I'm all right, boy.
PICARD Aren't I?
ZHABAN You took a bad knock.
ZHABAN Otherwise, you are apparently the same.
LARIS You gave us a fright.
PICARD Huh.
ZHABAN What happened, Admiral?
PICARD  Dahj.
PICARD  She's dead.
LARIS How is that possible?
ZHABAN The police didn't mention her.
ZHABAN They said you were alone when they found you on the roof.
LARIS They said there was no one else on the security feed but you.
LARIS That you were running...
ZHABAN She could've had a cloaking device and that's why we didn't see her on the property feeds.
PICARD Yeah, maybe it activated automatically... when she was in danger.
LARIS Sir?
PICARD She was a synthetic.
PICARD The assassins were Romulan.
PICARD Oh, she came here to find safety.
PICARD Like you and Zhaban.
PICARD Like me.
PICARD She deserved better from me.
PICARD I owe it to her to find out who killed her and why.
LARIS You ask too much of yourself.
PICARD Oh.
PICARD Sitting here, all these years, nursing my offended dignity, writing books of history people prefer to forget.
PICARD I never asked anything of myself I haven't been living.
PICARD I've been waiting to die.
JURATI Admiral Picard.
JURATI It's an honor.
PICARD Dr. Jurati. Thank you for giving me the time.
JURATI Oh, Agnes.
JURATI H-How can I help you?
PICARD You can tell me if it is possible to make a sentient android out of flesh and blood.
JURATI No, really. How can I...
JURATI Is that why you've come here?
PICARD It is.
JURATI Even before the ban, that was... well, uh....
JURATI W-Well, a flesh-and-blood android was in our sights, but a sentient one?
JURATI Not for a thousand years.
PICARD That makes it even more curious that recently I had tea with one.
JURATI It was the Grand Slam.
JURATI Uh, sentient synthetics that appear human inside and out.
JURATI Feels like a lifetime ago now.
JURATI Welcome to what's left of the Federation's Division of Advanced Synthetic Research.
PICARD It's a ghost town.
JURATI In more ways than one.
JURATI The androids that destroyed Mars came from this lab.
JURATI Now we're only allowed to operate theoretically.
JURATI Study, publish, run simulations.
PICARD But you can't actually make anything.
JURATI Correct. This is everything that ever mattered to us.
JURATI To me.
JURATI No one makes synths anymore, of any kind.
JURATI It's a violation of galactic treaty.
PICARD But isn't it possible to create a synthetic that looks fully human?
JURATI The short answer is no.
PICARD Well, give me the long answer.
JURATI It'll still be no.Please.
PICARD Humor me.
PICARD It's a B4, isn't it?
PICARD Looks so much like Data.
JURATI He's an inferior copy.
JURATI Data tried to download the contents of his neural net into B4 just before his death.
JURATI Almost all of it was lost.
JURATI Ultimately, B4 wasn't much like Data at all.
JURATI In fact, no other synth has been.
PICARD No.
JURATI And there's the rub.
JURATI No one has ever been able to redevelop the science used to create Data.
JURATI Then came Bruce.
JURATI Maddox. He recruited me out of Starfleet.
JURATI Despite Data's death, we came so close.
JURATI Then we got shut down, and it crushed him.
PICARD Where is he now?
JURATI He disappeared after the ban.
JURATI I've tried to find him, but...
PICARD You said "despite Data's death," meaning that any new synthetic would have to be made from Data.
JURATI Advanced ones, yes.
JURATI If you had Data's neural net, perfecting a flesh-and-blood host body would be relatively simple.
PICARD But his neurons died with him.
JURATI See, now you're coming around to that no I've been promising you.
PICARD Does this mean anything to you?
JURATI Where did you get that?
PICARD From my tea-drinking companion.
PICARD The one you said couldn't exist.
JURATI I really... really wish you'd come here on my day off.
JURATI It's a symbol for fractal neuronic cloning.
PICARD I'm sorry?
JURATI It was a radical, beautiful idea of Maddox's.
JURATI His theory was that Data's entire code, even his memories, could be reconstituted from a single positronic neuron.
JURATI If there is a synth out there who is perfect, like you say...
PICARD Then Data, or some part of him,
PICARD an essence of him...
JURATI Essence, yes.
PICARD ...would be alive.
JURATI There'd be no way of knowing without examining...
PICARD Dahj.
PICARD The girl.
PICARD PICARD Data's daughter.
PICARD He always wanted a daughter.
PICARD I believe that Maddox modeled her on an old painting of Data's.
JURATI A female?
JURATI Yes, I suppose you could make them that way.
PICARD Uh, I'm sorry? "Them"?
JURATI They're created in pairs.
PICARD Twins?
JURATI Twins.
PICARD So there's another one.
NAREK Dr. Asha?
NAREK I don't mean to intrude. I'm Narek.
NAREK I'm new here.
SOJI Soji.
NAREK That's a beautiful name.
NAREK I've been reading about your work.
NAREK It's-it's fascinating.
NAREK I feel like I've got so many questions.
SOJI And I feel like you're about to ask them.
NAREK That's nice.
NAREK Your necklace.
SOJI Uh, my father made it.
SOJI One for me and one for my sister.
SOJI I'm a twin.
NAREK Oh. I had a brother.
NAREK Not a twin, but... we were really close.
NAREK We, um... we lost him last year.
NAREK Very unexpected.
NAREK You're lucky to have her.
NAREK I'm sorry. You spend your day fixing broken people.
NAREK I'm guessing the last thing you want when you get off work is to listen to another sad story.
SOJI Guess again.
THE END
